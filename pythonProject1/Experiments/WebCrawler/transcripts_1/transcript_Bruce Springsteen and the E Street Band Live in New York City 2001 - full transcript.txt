That's where I wanna go tonight. I wanna go to that river side! I wanna find that river of life! I wanna find that river of love! I wanna find that river of faith! And that river of hope. Tonight I wanna go to that river of transformation. Where you can go and you can be changed. But you gotta work at it. That's right. I wanna go to that river of sanctification, where all life's graces and blessings can fall down upon you, like rain, but you've got to work at it. I wanna go... I wanna go to that river of resurrection where everybody gets a second chance. But you've got to work at it. Tonight I wanna go to that river of sexual healing, and companionship. I wanna find that river of joy, and that river of happiness. I'm not bullshitting back here. But you just don't stumble on to those things. You don't find those places by accident. You've got to seek them out. And search after them. And that's why we're here night after night after night after night. Because you can't get to those things by yourself. You've got to have help. And that's where I want to go tonight and I want you to go with me. Because I need to go with you. That's why I'm here. And tonight I wanna throw a rock and roll exorcism! A rock and roll baptism. And a rock and roll Bar Mitzvah. That's right. We're gonna do it all tonight, everything right here. I want them waters to fall down on me and set me free. And set you free. But I stood one evening as a young man before dark room of trees. And I was frightened to pass through those trees, even though I knew that on the other side the river of life was waiting. And there was cold beer at a reasonable price. And there were no fuckin' cell phones either. Pizza for everybody. But I stood paralyzed by my own fears. And then a gypsy woman called me onward and she said, "Son, come here. Let me help you." "What you need- What's your line?" And I told her what I did for a living and she said, "Well, then what you need," "is you need a man." "You need some help." And that's why I'm so glad to introduce here tonight on the piano, the secretary of intelligence, the Dean of the University of Musical Perversity, Professor Roy Bittan on the piano. And now I wanna introduce the minister of faith and friendship, keeper of all that is righteous on each tree and star of The Sopranos television show, little Steven van Zandt on the guitar. I wanna introduce the foundation of the E Street nation, The Tennessee Terror, Mr. Gary W. Tallent. And on drums, the man that brings the power night after night after night after night, the minister of the big beat, and star of late night television, the mighty, might Max Weinberg. On the guitar, the godfather of the guitar, the minister of heart and spirit, the great Nils Lofgren.

Here's to the Todd Sue's. Everywhere I'm going, I'm seeing people lost in confusion. I'm seeing people lost in the wilderness of the concrete jungle. I've seen people lost in the loneliness of the subways. I've seen people lost in envy over the Jersey Devils winning the Stanley cup. I've seen people lost at the Statue of Liberty, which is actually in New Jersey. I've seen people lost in the New York Giants memorabilia, who actually happen to play in New Jersey. I've seen people lost singing the theme song, "New York, New York", which, come to think of it, is actually sung by a man from New Jersey! I've seen people lost when the garbage men go on strike and the garbage piles up and they keep trying to send it to New Jersey. I can feel your pain! But that's alright. 'Cause tonight I have come across the great Hudson river, on an ambassadorial mission, to bring peace, love and brotherhood, to these two great civilizations, I'm here tonight. I'm here tonight.
