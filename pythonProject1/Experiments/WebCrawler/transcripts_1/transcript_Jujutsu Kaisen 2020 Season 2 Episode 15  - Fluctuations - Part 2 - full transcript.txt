Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- Mr. Nanami. That octopus thought I am fighting against his domain. But I have a different purpose. I want to make a hole in the domain in this barrier. The hole I came through has been blocked. It's more difficult to make it from inside, but I can maintain a hole for one person to pass through for a few seconds. The edge of the barrier is under my feet. I touched it when I came in, so I know. I can start at any time. You three just need to rush in together. We can't leave you alone inside. I will stake my life. But I don't intend to sacrifice it. (Episode 39: Fluctuations - Part 2) You two... Gather! The enemy can understand human speech. Only tactful communication is allowed, which shows trust in a Grade 1 sorcerer. Get out of this domain. The option that is no longer in mind has surfaced again. They want to protect that boy together? In this way, I can also... No. He noticed, but it's too late. To Fushiguro's feet! The person who was born inheriting the Zenin Family's curse. The person who can't completely abandon that curse. They witnessed with their own eyes the body of the person who abandoned everything, and the movement. Who is he? A human... A sorcerer? They didn't escape, but invited a new sorcerer in? So fast. Wasn't he just in the air? And he's not just fast... He is way too strong. Senior Maki! I didn't sense his cursed energy at all. I lost to him in terms of strength? I can't believe it. Fushiguro. It's no use. The hole has been already blocked. The enemy must have figured it out just now. He won't give us a chance to open a new hole. Toji? Granny Ogami's Exorcism continues even after her death. When the cursed energy of her grandson, who serves as a vessel, is exhausted, the exorcism should end as well. After being overlaid by Zenin Toji's body, the grandson's soul has no cursed energy. Besides, this body does not consume cursed energy, so the cursed technique has lost its endpoint. This series of anomalies led to the loss of control of the technique. Now, Zenin Toji will fight on instinct until the vessel breaks. He has turned into a killing puppet. This man has no cursed energy? He's insignificant. His fangs always point to the strong. (JUJUTSU KAISEN Shibuya Incident) Old man. Who is that guy? A spirit. Fushiguro, can you hold on a bit longer? Okay. I'm sorry. I have to bet my hopes on him. He makes the Playful Cloud collide. Is he sharpening them? Am I going to lose? To a human without cursed energy? No, I can feel the kid's domain is weakening. As long as I can restore the guaranteed hit, I can kill everyone. I need to buy some time. You can suspend in the air? Do I need to repeat? It's not over... The domain is gone. He really exorcised that octopus on his own. If Fushiguro didn't come in time, we'd certainly have been wiped out. But there's still one problem. Is he on our side? What? When did I come outside? He is ridiculously fast. Maybe even faster than Sukuna. Who on earth is this guy? Megumi! Are you dead, Dagon? Hey, what kind of joke is this? He's much stronger than... Let me handle the rest. The cursed spirit called Dagon. Even if we don't live on humans, our souls will still reincarnate. Let's meet again in the wilderness in a hundred years. So... The first one. Nanami... The second one. The third one. Sukuna. No, it's the finger. Sukuna's finger was released somewhere in Shibuya. We need to hurry, Nanako. The finger might attract the cursed spirits. I know. Please. Come out. Lord Sukuna. You two, how many fingers did you feed him? I won't tell you. Mimiko! Is that so? Die. Good, the pattern hasn't disappeared. Although it's unexpected, I need to take full advantage of this. Even if Yuji Itadori absorbs all of the 20 fingers, he probably won't hand over the control of his body to Sukuna, right? But I was talking about eating one finger a day and taking 20 days to finish. If he eats ten fingers at a time, he won't have time to adapt. Although it's only temporary, the control of his body will be transferred to Sukuna. Wake up. Sukuna. (JUJUTSU KAISEN) (JUJUTSU KAISEN) We made him eat ten fingers. So now, there are at least 15 fingers in him. You are still alive. It's probably because of one of their techniques. But they're so scared, they probably can't block it much longer. Don't waste my time. You have one second. Move away. This is Sukuna. A formidable power different from Satoru Gojo. An overwhelming evil. The fear that every move of both sides could be the cause of death. Breathe. Breathe... Can I breathe? Will I get killed? You lift your heads too high. Do you think kneeling on one knee is enough? Isn't it said that ripe rice... Your head seems quite light. Brats. I'll start with you. Do you have something to say to me? I can listen for a while. Say it. Down there... Down there is a man with a suture on his forehead, wearing a cassock. Please... Please kill him. Please... Relieve Master Geto. Right, Master Geto. Who is Satoru Gojo? Is he strong? Yeah. He used to be my friend. We had a fight and haven't seen each other since then. I like you. I like you. I like you. I like you. Satoru Gojo killed Master Geto. We will never forgive him. But I think it's good. Because Satoru Gojo is Master Geto's only friend. You're not. Go to hell. I'll make you regret it. We know the location of another finger. If you can kill him, I'll tell you where the finger is. - So please... - Lift your head. Mimiko... - Do you think you can command me - Mimiko. - with just a finger? - No... Mimiko. No... Mimiko. Annoying. Sukuna, die! Cell phone... No, the camera? It can probably have some effect on the filmed subject. Boring. Your turn. Cursed spirit, what do you want from me? I want nothing. What? Our goal is to fully revive you. Itadori hasn't adapted yet, so you are temporarily granted freedom. You should know it best. Even if Sukuna's reverse cursed technique can cure people, souls transfigured by Mahito's Idle Transfiguration can't be saved. At that time, Sukuna did try to make a Binding Vow, but he failed to establish one. Before Yuji Itadori returns, you must make a Binding Vow with him. One that allows you to have physical dominance forever. Many of Itadori's companions are here. There are plenty of ways. No need. I have my plan. But... well... You guys are trying hard. To thank you for the fingers, just come at me. If you can hit me once, I'll work under you. By then, I'll kill all the humans in Shibuya, except for one. It's a deal. - This happens when using techniques. - Sorry, there's a minor here. - Barrier, cursed technique. - Sorry, there are students watching. I'm going with paper. - People going with scissors might have good luck tomorrow. - Don't suddenly become minor-friendly. (Next Episode: Thunderbolt) I'm drunk.
