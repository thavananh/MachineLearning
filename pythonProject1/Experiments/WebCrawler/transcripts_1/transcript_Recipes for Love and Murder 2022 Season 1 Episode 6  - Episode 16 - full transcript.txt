Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- [Maria] Previously on "Recipes For Love And Murder..." Two citizens have been murdered. [sobbing] I'm leaving. First to Makhanda for the funeral. And then to Cape Town. Oh, she was very private about everything. He pays for our daughter's special needs home. I asked her brother David today if he knew how Martine's daughter is doing... Turns out he didn't even know Jamie existed. Mrs. Purvis. It's Constable McClintock. I was here the other day when your husband passed away. [whispers] It was me. Uh, the...egg boiler. -Oh! You! -Shh-shh! Maybe you should come for a cooking lesson. [instrumental music] Oh, cock! Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays I wait for Mr. Matias. A few weeks back he drove me home. Because he wanted to speak to her. She opened the door took one look at him and told him to voetsek. I've spoken to Mr. Van Wyk and he's in agreement. The Gazette stops this politics or we pull our advertising. I finally got that bloody lawyer on the phone. Paperwork's ready. The sequel franchises we spoke about? Robson Vista, Oudtshroon, all yours. I was wondering if maybe you could give her this police pamphlet on the dangers of drunk driving? She also tried to kiss me even though I didn't wanted to but I... couldn't find a pamphlet for that. Do you grow pomegranates? Yeah. I planted a whole orchid for her and that wasn't enough. Yesterday when I was at the hospital I told Anna about John, how Martine have been seeing him. She was very angry. We need to get to John's farm and warn him now. [siren wailing] [intense music] Ow! Just leave him alone. -I'm gonna call the cops! -Go ahead! Then they can arrest this murderer for us. After we've killed him! I'll keep watch. -I'm sorry I thought it was you. -I'd never hurt Tienie! -Even though she lied to me. -She lied to both of us. You never could stand losing to me, could you, huh ? You'd better hope the cops come before I finish you off, you bastard. [Maria]Dirk! Anna! Now how does your blerrie gun work? -You! -I wish Jessie was here. She knows what to do in these situations. [theme music] [music continues] Careful, careful, careful! I think they've escaped from a mental asylum. Just the hospital. -He slept with my wife. -He killed my love. If he did those things, the police will arrest him. Wait, he did what? -I'm gonna kill him. -No, no, no, wait. Before you inject air into his blood stream I need to hear what this asshole's done. [grunts] It seems they were all in love with the same person, you see. You promised you wouldn't see her again. -Did you lie to me, John? -No, no, no. I'd check his alibi, sweetie. I know how much he loved Martine. Oh, you! Talk. Talk! It might be easier for him to talk if you weren't actually squashing his neck, Anna. You called her name at the wrong time. Don't pretend. I-I heard you. Oh, so, you did sleep with my wife! No, no, no, no. She wanted to talk about the property. Someone was...Marius Rabie, that property guy? He was pressuring her. Did you take her pomegranate juice? Pomegranates aren't ripe yet. You do have a greenhouse outside. They're green, they're green, I-I swear Didi, I wasn't having an affair! [sighs] I think he's telling the truth. He's a crap liar. Did you speak to Marius Rabie about the pomegranates? -Marius? -A guy like that. Violent you know, not getting his way. A woman daring to disobey him. He went around your house many times threatening her. Maybe he just went through with it eventually. I'm gonna kill him! [all] Oh! -I'll go and put the kettle on. -Kettle on. [footsteps approaching] Hey, good to see you again. Sorry about your door, John. Dirk, put that gun down. Okay. Is it all safe? Do you realize I can arrest you for stealing government property. Including quite the rap sheets there, tampering with evidence assaulting a police officer. Discharging a weapon in public. Hello, Piet. Will you come look at the green house with me? -Oh, Maria, you're okay! -All fine, thanks Hattie. -Will you have a cup of tea? -Oh, no I couldn't . I am sticking to decaf, just for a few days. I haven't been sleeping well. Excuse me! I'm trying to run an investigation here. -Tea? -I'll actually take-- No, you won't have it. You and Anna sit there and shut up! -And you! -John. -You? -Martine. No! Sorry, Didi. Isn't that how it goes, John? You go and wait in the kitchen. And the rest of you, out. Out! [all shudder] [instrumental music] [Maria] He said they were green. You could definitely get juice from these. So, he was a liar. But why would Anna and Dirk think he's a murderer? That might be my fault. I told Anna that Martine was seeing John again. I thought it would shake her out of her martyr routine. Instead, it turned her into an avenging angel. Yeah. Right. I'll take some samples and see if the lab can compare them. You know, this is an impressive set up. You can persuade anything to grow if you treat it right. I thought about doing a Masters in botany, but there's no real money in that. So, I went into forensics instead. -We could still dabble. -What, in botany? Better than dabbling in forensics. [both chuckles] We could go halves on a greenhouse. Grow the best veggies in the Klein Karoo. Not a bad idea at all! I'm serious. Oh jeepers! I have to go. I'll be late for a date. Okay. You two have any as called evidence that John killed Martine? -They were seeing each other. -Yeah. So, you two put your little death feud on hold break out of the hospital, steal the ambulance so, that you can kill him? You're wasting your time with us, okay? -We didn't kill her. -Didn't kill her. What about the gun? It's John's gun. He thought to put it on me. [bell chiming] Where were you when Martine was killed? [John]At my sister-in-laws wedding in Somerset West. -Bullshit. -It's true. She bloody Facebook lived the whole thing you can check. [instrumental music] [knock on the door] Come in. Don't mind the police. Oh, you're ready for your cooking lesson. Oh, yes. [chuckles] Thanks so much for this. I'm gonna tell Tasha. I just wanted to do it over a brilliant meal. That your mother didn't make? [both laugh] Yeah. Anyway, it really is very kind of you, thank you. Okay, well, we're going to cook with beer. Hm, awesome, I'd love one. -That's for the Kudu. -Oh! Now, I've preheated my oven to 140 degrees. I want you to season this. -This meat here. -Okay. Mm-hmm. [Maria] The most important lesson when it comes to cooking is finding a recipe that really suits you. Okay. Oops! [Maria]Rub it firmly, don't be scared. Okay. Good. Ooh! Hot date? Yes, we're actually, properly, going on a date. Make sure he treats you with respect now. He should value your conversation as much as your body. [laughs] Anything else, Miss Teen Vogue. [Maria] It's always good to work with honest ingredients like Kudu. And we're going to brown the meat. You can't hide the flavor of Kudu. [oil sizzles] Hm. Step one. You can have a beer. Wow, thank you. Cheers. [instrumental music] [Maria] Beer is an acquired taste but it will bring out the best in your other ingredients. Er, wait. Thanks. [laughing] Thank you, sir. -You're ready for more flavor? -Yeah. Tomato paste, chilies. Few bay leaves. And thyme and coffee. Wow, coffee and beer in the same dish. This is so me. Well, I'm glad I could teach you how to be yourself then. Trust your instincts and don't be afraid to laugh and have fun. [chuckles] Okay, mum. Mom, I was trying to sound like you. That's one way to tell if it's going well. Always smell, always taste. Yes, ma'am. Now you're going to pour all of that deliciousness over the meat. Goodnight, boss. [phone vibrates] Oh! Detective, hello. Hi. Yes, yes, um... Now put the lid from the roasting pan on top just so none of the flavor escapes. [sighs] -Hurray. -Cheers. Uh, Piet, you need to come out and cover Maria's house after all. Okay. [Maria] Okay, over here. Oh. I want to leave it in there for 90 minutes. Okay, wow, that's amazing. I can actually do this. -I know I can. -Perfect. Yeah. Now, there's just the whole... telling the truth thing. Just take a deep breath, count to three... and get it done. [instrumental music] [vehicle approaching] [music continues] I'll come back for the bed later. The NGO is going to be very grateful. I thought I was gonna be too late. [laughs] Good luck with your studies. They're gonna be great. I think so. I think so. -You must come and visit. -Of course I will. Hey! [both laughing] Jessie! Whoever he is, I hope he knows he's a very lucky man. I must go. Yeah. [speaks in foreign language] I'll as Maria to look after them. She's good at keeping things alive. [engine revving] [instrumental music] Mmm. [Jeff]Mhm. Um, so, Tash. Mm? Um... Hm, sorry. There's actually something I've been... meaning to tell you. [gasps] Mm. Is it how fabulous I am? No...I mean, yes. Of course. But now, um... It's actually about the...food. Hey, you've come a long way very quickly. I mean, this is miles better than the boiled eggs. What? [chuckles] Jeff, love. You can pause it because they're here all the time. It wasn't difficult to figure out who was writing to Tannie Maria. But why didn't you say anything? I mean, you've always acted like your life was so perfect. Maybe I was glad that not everything was like that, hm. I think it's time you update the website and feature your mom, don't you? -Hm. -Hm. So, you'll still marry me? Hm... Probably. I mean, I'll give you boiled eggs for lunch, if you want. No, no way. This is good. -This is good. -Cheers. Cheers. ♪ I see how you learn... ♪♪ Hey. Hey, wow. You look beautiful. I know. [chuckles] I'm sorry. Uh, let me take this for you. Oh, thank you. Go and this way. What the fuck? [phone vibrates] Hello. Tannie M! It's Candy! No, no, no, I'm with Regardt, all that, that's all fine. She's having dinner with Khaya. Oh! Jessie, you just, you have a lovely evening with Regardt. Forget about everything else. [knocking on the door] Okay. Bye, I've gotta go, bye. [Piet] Evening chef reporting for duty. Hi, Piet. -How do you feel about kudu? -Oh, it's beautiful. Can be dangerous if not managed properly. I mean, about eating kudu? I'm a fan. Well, you're in luck. Oh, thank you. -Mm. -Oh, wow! -Mm-hmm. -Wow! -Mm. -Mm. So, um, is your mum home with the kids tonight or... Bronwyn's babysitting Riley, so mad about it. Oh, I used to babysit a lot. My little brother hated it too. One day, he just stopped complaining and it took me about a month to figure out my mom was actually bribing him. Little brothers are so ungrateful. The worst. So, how often do you get back to the Karoo? Oh, not often enough really. The last few years, work has been busy. And I blew Martine off once or twice. I'm sure she understood. I did offer to fly her out to come visit in the States but... she never wanted to be too far away from her daughter. I know, she was away at school, but... Martine always knew that she could be with her in just a few hours if anything bad happened. I think it was in second year in uni I finally, I got the hang of being a student. Started making these crazy Sunday lunches for anyone who dropped by. They'd each just had to bring an ingredient. -Mm, that sounds like good fun. -It was. [chuckles] It was a community. Of course I left uni soon after when I married Mickey. Hm. Yeah, community is everything. You know, when I'm in charge of the police station here it's gonna be all about the community events. Are you taking over? Well, not officially, but I would like to think so. Khaya is only on a two-year contract. Hm. I'm sure you will be excellent at it. I know, I will be. So, what's next for you? Um... -Like a malva pudding or? -No, man. [chuckles] What's next in your life? Like, I'm gonna register to UNISA, and finish my degree online, apply to some papers in Cape Town. But I have to start pitching online stuff. Build my portfolio, you know. Hm, wow. I um.. I like being a cop. And I love it here, so... -Really? -Yeah. My dad always said that a good cop can make a big difference, so, I'm just trying to do that. But-but your plans sound great. I'm...sure you'll get published! And you know... online means it doesn't really matter if you're... in Cape Town or still here in Eden. Maybe not for the next year or two, but I'm a journalist. I'm gonna need to leave this place for Cape Town or Josi maybe even New York. Recently though... I was wondering if Martine was thinking of leaving. Just something she said about borrowing money. But she knew her dad would say no. His kids wont see a single cent until he's dead. I heard he's got quite a few cents. He could buy this whole town if he wanted to. Anyway, enough of that. Tell me about you. Are you enjoying life here? Certainly interesting at the moment. [scoffs] Absolutely. It's the best place for me to be if there's any intruders. Well... It's nice to think of you out here. -Goodnight, Piet. -Goodnight, Maria. This was fun. ♪ I have dreams I work hard... ♪ Thank you for dinner. You're lovely. ♪ I have visions ♪ ♪ I see myself at the center of the world ♪ ♪ When they call out my name and it.. ♪♪ Goodnight, boss! [instrumental music] [Dorette] Dear, Tannie Maria. I'm really confused, and a little scared. Every morning, I find a doughnut. I don't know if it's meant to be a gift, or a threat, but I've started to have dreams of a giant monster throwing doughnuts, trying to pin my arms to my sides so, that he can eat me. The police say that it's not a crime. Can you help me? Please. [instrumental music] [Jessie]Hey, Hattie. Jess. -You okay? -I think so. [playful music] This one doesn't quite have the girth. Maria. Have you gone quite mad? No, no. This is actually...science. And one of them has got to fit! How many doughnuts do you have? Maria, whatever this is you need to put it on hold. We have a funeral to get to. [instrumental music] Have you seen the priest? You're a disgrace for a son-in-law. If I was a younger man... Your sister's death has been such a huge shock for the whole Koop family. Martine was quiet and-and hard working. One of the reasons why everything kept ticking along. You know, I've just recently won a new award and... a regional award, mind you but managed to secure a very large Koop franchise in the Klein Karoo. I'm so sad that she won't be here to benefit from my-well... our success. You know, I saw her the day she died, eh? She had this sad look on her eyes like maybe she knew it was coming. My husband had a look like that last week, turned out to be indigestion. [sighs] Sweety, you let me know if you need anything, okay? Don't worry, grandpa's taking care of me. Great. Grandpa, remind me what Uncle David does? Gets in the way, mostly. Oh, thank goodness! This lot needs help getting into the church. Tannie Kuruman has some problem with the food, I didn't dare ask what, and guess what... there's no priest, we don't have a priest. Jessie, get Regardt, help everyone get into the church. Hattie, call the Lovebirds Cafe, tell the chef, he owes Maria that favor now. -Wait, where are you going? -I'm going to get us a priest! Hello. Hello. Oh. You do funerals, don't you? In your religion, I mean? -Yes, we do. -Could you officiate one? It's-it's Martine's funeral and the priest hasn't arrived and if we don't get this going soon there some of the guests are going to end up killing each other. Just a minute. [organ music] Thank goodness. -You're the priest? -No, I'm-- I'm the ordained female elder. Just trust me. ♪ Amazing Grace ♪ ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a... ♪♪ [undertaker] Was there a particular hymn your husband favored? Mrs. Purvis? Um... He liked Christmas Carols. "Amazing Grace" is popular or "Abide with me?" "The lord is my shepherd?" He was fond of sheep. If we went walking and we saw sheep, he'd like that. The lord is fond of his flock too. Sorry, not the time for jokes. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that was a joke. [clears throat] The Lord says assuredly the evil man will not go unpunished. [instrumental music] But the descendent of the righteous will be delivered. Proverbs chapter 11 verse 21. Martine was taken from us too soon. I remember her telling me children are the gifts we give the world. And I want to start by telling Jamie that we mourn with her, for the loss of her mother, and that we are so grateful for the gift Martine gave us, in Jamie. Let is bow our heads and pray. [instrumental music] -Tannie Maria, a word. -That's two words. Hm? Tannie Koekemoer says you helped with the catering. I'd love to cover your costs. A little donation from the Koop. Well, that's very kind of you. But actually all the food was donated already, so, there are no costs. -Thank you, though. -Oh. -Will you excuse me? -Of course. -So many people. -Yeah. Grace said Van Wyk gave her money in Martine's memory to help her get started in Cape Town. He must be feeling very charitable, he just offered to pay for the funeral catering. He'd like it best if we thanked him in the paper for it. [chuckles] Did Mr. Rabie give Grace anything? As if. You know that he's still campaigning against us? He's threatened to get all our advertisers to drop us. Shame! Looks like everyone's abandoned Grandpops and Martine's daughter. Let me go get him a cup of coffee. Koppie koffie oom? Oh, why thank you, young lady. -Anything for you? -I'm good. Such a sad day. I... I always picture her in yellow, you know. Hm. In a yellow dress, like a sunflower. She'd look beautiful in yellow. [intense music] Are you-- Oh, gosh! [choking] Step back, step back everyone! [choking] [music intensifies] [siren wailing] Jessie? But if you're here, who's watching Riley? You know Bronwyn has dance practice. I asked Tannie Vygie next door to keep an eye. [scoffs] An eye? She's so blind, she needs both eyes and two pairs of glasses. That's not fair on Riley, Jessie. You know he hates it there. Ah, Jess? Why didn't you just say you were here to see your boyfriend? [whispers] Mom! -Hey. -Hey. How's Martine's dad, is he stable? Yes, he's stable. They gave him a sedative though. Okay. Keep me posted. [instrumental music] Hattie? I see your tabloid just ran another article highlighting a black worker claiming he's being mistreated. We ran a fact-checked piece on unfair labor practices in our community. In our newspaper. I warn you now, print one more piece like that and you're toast. Where's your socialist colleague? If you mean our star reporter, she's at the hospital awaiting news of what might be the town's third murder victim. [gasps] [instrumental music] Funerals make me so tired. [sighs] [crickets chirping] [thud] [intense music] [clattering] Oh, I hope you like them sunny side up. How long have I been asleep for? About a half an hour. Um...I made breakfast for supper. It's the only one I'm good at. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, I messed up your kitchen. Oh, I can go wait outside for the rest of my shift. Nobody's cooked for me in over 20 years. [munches] [Khaya]Um... [laughs] -Would you like some mushrooms? -Mm-hmm. It's good. There's a little bit of tomato too. There you go. Thank you. Hm. Yeah. [Candy whispers] Doesn't look very good. It's just a matter of time. -But how long. -I don't know. What's just a matter of time mean? Does it mean any day, an hour... I don't know. Jessie. I just wanted to make sure that he was okay. Oh, you're a darling. Ah, he seems to be peaceful for now at least. Weren't you standing next to him when he was poisoned? Shouldn't the police be questioning you? David! She's a friend. She's been so kind to me. This day has been long and hard. Saying goodbye to Martine, and now... Uncle Peter being like this! What did the doctor say? [sighs] Something about tests, I couldn't really pay attention. Did they take samples of what he ate or drank? You ask a lot of questions. She's a reporter, its her job. She's trying to solve Martine's murder for us. How kind. [chuckles] Okay, here you go. Well, detective. That was the best "breakfast for dinner," I've ever had. Thank you. It's my daughter's favorite. She must love it when her dad cooks. Well, dad cooks a lot... especially since her mother died. She didn't always love it but bacon made everything better. [laughs] At least for a while. When did her mother pass away? A long time ago. I'm sorry. Thank you. It's tough on her. Me too, I guess. Maria, I need to talk to you about something else. Yes? It's a bit delicate. It's about Candy. Oh! You know... You really don't need to say anything. I had dinner with her last night. Honestly, Jessie. You've all been so generous and kind. I don't know if I'll ever be able to repay you. I'm sorry for calling you a slut. You're sorry, what? Just everything you've been through, I'm so sorry. That's okay. Thank you. -I need to go. -Yeah. And our conversation was quite illuminating. Really, you don't need t-- Based on what she told me, and what happened at the funeral today. -You've fallen for her. -Martine's brother might be... the murderer. -What? -What? Finally! I thought she'd never leave. She's too nosy. Ah, she's just doing her job, David. Are you sure about this? All these years the money's just been piling up. And if Peter dies now that Martine's dead already, it all goes to David. I wonder if Candy suspects anything. That's why he was so angry about her daughter. -Candy's got a daughter? -No, Martine's daughter. David didn't even know she existed until this week. Oh, and the grandpa was doting on the girl today. Even more likely to give her money with her mum dead, he had to act fast. So, David surprises Martine drugs the pomegranate juice, kills her and then...disappears. Spotted by Lawrence. -Or he thinks he has been. -Mm-hmm. And lures him back. What did forensic say? Did they give you any indication of the height of the killer? I'm afraid I can't tell you that. Um, I just wanted to warn you. I shouldn't have told you at all. 'Cause I know you're very close to the family. Well, not as close as you. Wait... Well, I'll see if I can unearth a bottle of wine. We could just keep chatting over. No, I can't. I'm on duty. I didn't mean to lead you astray, detective. -I didn't mean like that. -You know, actually... It's-it's been a really long day. Uh, if you'll excuse me. [suspenseful music] Stop right there! You! Yeah, skattebol,it's me. I thought you knew it was me. Always give you doughnuts on your birthday. It was our special thing. No. I always gave youdoughnuts because youlike them. Oh, I-I miss you. I'm-I'm no-I'm no good without you. I thought... I thought if you knew how much I missed you, you would... [pensive music] Piss off! If you come back here, or if I ever find any more mysterious doughnuts... I'd be getting a restraining order. [instrumental music] [breathing heavily] I don't think he's waking up anytime soon. Okay, let's do it. [intense music] But we're gonna have to act fast... before the poison finishes him off. [dramatic music] [theme music] [music continues]
