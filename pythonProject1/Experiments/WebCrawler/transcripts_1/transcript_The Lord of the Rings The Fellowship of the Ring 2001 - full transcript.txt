Much that once was... ...is lost. Fornone now live who rememberit. ltbegan with the forging ofthe Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves.: lmmortal, wisest and fairest ofallbeings. Seven to the Dwarf-lords.: Great miners and craftsmen ofthe mountain halls. And nine... ...nine rings were gifted to the race ofMen... ...who, above all else, desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all ofthem deceived. Foranotherring was made. ln the land ofMordor, in the fires ofMount Doom... ...the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a MasterRing... ...to control all others. And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice... ...and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all. One by one... ...the Free Lands ofMiddle-earth fell to the powerofthe Ring. But there were some who resisted. A Last Alliance ofMen and Elves marched against the armies ofMordor. And on the slopes ofMount Doom, they fought for the freedom ofMiddle-earth. Victory was near. But the powerofthe Ring... ...could notbe undone. lt was in this moment... ...when all hope had faded... ...that lsildur, son ofthe king, took up his father's sword. Sauron, the enemy ofthe Free Peoples ofMiddle-earth, was defeated. The Ring passed to lsildur... ...who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. But the hearts ofMen... ...are easily corrupted. And the Ring ofPower has a will ofits own. ltbetrayed lsildur to his death. And some things that should not have been forgotten... ...were lost. Historybecame legend... ...legendbecame myth. And for two and a halfthousandyears... ...the Ring passed out ofall knowledge. Until, when chance came... ...it ensnared a newbearer. My precious. The Ring came to the creature Gollum... ...who took it deep into the tunnels ofthe Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. It came to me. My own. My Iove. My own. My precious. The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For 500 years itpoisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness creptback into the forests ofthe world. Rumorgrew ofa shadow in the East... ...whispers ofa nameless fear. And the Ring ofPowerperceived... ...its time had now come. lt abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the Ring did not intend. lt waspicked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. What's this? A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins ofthe Shire. A ring. Lost! My precious is Iost! For the time will soon come... ...when Hobbits will shape the fortunes ofall. The Shire...60 years Iater Down from the door where itbegan And l must follow ifl can The road goes everon and on Down from the door where itbegan Now farahead the road has gone -And l must follow ifl can -You're Iate. A wizard is never Iate, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he earIy. He arrives preciseIy when he means to. It's wonderfuI to see you, GandaIf! You didn't think I'd miss your UncIe BiIbo's birthday? What news ofthe outside worId? TeII me everything. Everything? You're far too eager and curious for a Hobbit. Most unnaturaI. WeII, what can I teII you? Life in the wide worId goes on much as it has this past Age. FuII of its own comings and goings. ScarceIy aware ofthe existence of Hobbits. For which I am very thankfuI. It's GandaIf! The Iong-expected party. How is the oId rascaI? I hear it's going to be a party of speciaI magnificence. You know BiIbo. He's got the whoIe pIace in an uproar. WeII, that shouId pIease him. -HaIfthe Shire's been invited. -Gracious me. -He's up to something. -Oh, reaIIy? AII right, then. Keep your secrets. Before you came aIong, we Bagginses were very weII thought of. Indeed. Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was bareIy invoIved. AII I did was give your uncIe a IittIe nudge out ofthe door. Whatever you did, you've been officiaIIy IabeIed a disturber ofthe peace. Oh, reaIIy? GandaIf! GandaIf! Fireworks, GandaIf! -GandaIf! -Fireworks, GandaIf! GandaIf? -I'm gIad you're back. -So am I, dear boy. So am I. No, thank you! We don't want any more visitors, weII-wishers or distant reIations! And what about very oId friends? GandaIf? -BiIbo Baggins. -My dear GandaIf! Good to see you. 1 1 1 years oId! Who wouId beIieve it? You haven't aged a day. Come on, come in! WeIcome, weIcome. Oh, here we are. Tea? Or maybe something a IittIe stronger? I've got a few bottIes ofthe OId Winyard Ieft. 1 296. Very good year. AImost as oId as I am. It was Iaid down by my father. What say we open one, eh? Just tea, thank you. I was expecting you sometime Iast week. Not that it matters. You come and go as you pIease. AIways have and aIways wiII. You caught me a bit unprepared. We've onIy got coId chicken and a bit of pickIe.... There's some cheese here. No, that won't do. We've got raspberry jam, an appIe tart.... But not much for afters. Oh, no, we're aII right. I've just found some sponge cake. I couId make you some eggs if you'd-- -Just tea, thank you. -Oh, right. -You don't mind if I eat, do you? -No, not at aII. BiIbo! BiIbo Baggins! I'm not at home! I've got to get away from these confounded reIatives, hanging on the beII aII day... ...never giving me a moment's peace. I want to see mountains again. Mountains, GandaIf! And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea. -So you mean to go through with your pIan? -Yes, yes. It's aII in hand. AII the arrangements are made. Oh, thank you. Frodo suspects something. Of course he does. He's a Baggins... ...not some bIockheaded BracegirdIe from HardbottIe. You wiII teII him, won't you? -Yes, yes. -He's very fond of you. I know. He'd probabIy come with me if I asked him. I think in his heart, Frodo's stiII in Iove with the Shire. The woods, the fieIds. LittIe rivers. I am oId, GandaIf. I know I don't Iook it, but I'm beginning to feeI it in my heart. I feeI thin. Sort of stretched... ...Iike butter scraped over too much bread. I need a hoIiday. A very Iong hoIiday. And I don't expect I shaII return. In fact, I mean not to. OId Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing. GandaIf, my oId friend... ...this wiII be a night to remember. HeIIo, heIIo. Fatty BoIger. LoveIy to see you. WeIcome, weIcome. Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance. -I think I'II just have another aIe. -Oh, no, you don't. Go on! So there I was... ...at the mercy ofthree monstrous troIIs. And they were aII arguing amongst themseIves... ...about how they were going to cook us. Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jeIIy. They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors... ...that the sun's first Iight crept over the top ofthe trees... ...and turned them aII to stone! QuickIy. Up they go! No, the big one. -Done! -You're supposed to stick it in the ground. -It is in the ground. -Outside! This was your idea. Watch out for the dragon! Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years. -That was good. -Let's get another one. Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. I might've known. Speech, BiIbo! Speech! Speech! My dear Bagginses and Boffins... ...Tooks and Brandybucks... ...Grubbs, Chubbs... ...HornbIowers... ...BoIgers... ...BracegirdIes... -...and Proudfoots. -Proudfeet! Today is my 1 1 1th birthday! Happy birthday! But aIas, eIeventy-one years is far too short a time to Iive among... ...such exceIIent and admirabIe Hobbits. I don't know haIf of you haIf as weII as I shouId Iike... ...and I Iike Iess than haIf of you haIf as weII as you deserve. I have things to do. I've put this offfar too Iong. I regret to announce this is the end! I'm going now. I bid you aII a very fond fareweII. Goodbye. I suppose you think that was terribIy cIever. Come on, GandaIf. Did you see their faces? There are many magic rings in this worId, and none ofthem shouId be used IightIy. It was just a bit offun. Oh, you're probabIy right, as usuaI. -You wiII keep an eye on Frodo, won't you? -Two eyes. As often as I can spare them. -I'm Ieaving everything to him. -What about this ring of yours? -Is that staying too? -Yes, yes. It's in an enveIope over there on the manteIpiece. No. Wait, it's... ...here in my pocket. Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now? Yet, after aII, why not? -Why shouIdn't I keep it? -I think you shouId Ieave the ring behind. Is that so hard? WeII, no. And yes. Now it comes to it, I don't feeI Iike parting with it. It's mine. I found it! It came to me! -There's no need to get angry. -WeII, if I'm angry, it's your fauIt! It's mine. My own. -My precious. -Precious? It's been caIIed that before, but not by you. What business is it of yours what I do with my own things? I think you've had that ring quite Iong enough. -You want it for yourseIf! -BiIbo Baggins! Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks. I am not trying to rob you. I'm trying to heIp you. AII your Iong years, we've been friends. Trust me as you once did. Let it go. You're right, GandaIf. The ring must go to Frodo. It's Iate. The road is Iong. Yes, it is time. The ring is stiII in your pocket. I've thought up an ending for my book: ''And he Iived happiIy ever after to the end of his days.'' And I'm sure you wiII, my dear friend. Goodbye, GandaIf. Goodbye, dear BiIbo. The road goes everon and on UntiI our next meeting. lt's mine. My own. Myprecious. RiddIes in the dark. BiIbo! BiIbo! My precious. Precious. He's gone, hasn't he? He taIked for so Iong about Ieaving... ...I didn't think he'd reaIIy do it. GandaIf? BiIbo's ring. He's gone to stay with the EIves. He's Ieft you Bag End. AIong with aII his possessions. The ring is yours now. -Put it somewhere out of sight. -Where are you going? -There are some things that I must see to. -What things? -Questions. Questions that need answering. -You've onIy just arrived. I don't understand. Neither do I. Keep it secret. Keep it safe. Shirel Bagginsl ''The year 3434 ofthe Second Age. Here follows the account oflsildur, High King of Gondor... ...and the finding ofthe Ring ofPower. '' ''lt has come to me. The One Ring. lt shallbe an heirloom ofmy kingdom. All those who follow in mybloodline shallbe bound to its fate... ...forl willrisk no hurt to the Ring. lt isprecious to me... ...though l buy it with greatpain. The markings upon the band begin to fade. The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has allbut disappeared. A secret now that only fire can tell. '' Shire. Baggins. There's no Bagginses around here. They're aII up in Hobbiton. That way. -Good night. -Good night. Good night, Sam. Is it secret? Is it safe? What are you doing? HoId out your hand, Frodo. It's quite cooI. What can you see? Can you see anything? Nothing. There's nothing. Wait. There are markings. It's some form of EIvish. I can't read it. There are few who can. The Ianguage is that of Mordor, which I wiII not utter here. Mordor! In the common tongue, it says: ''One Ring to ruIe them aII... ...One Ring to find them... ...One Ring to bring them aII... ...and in the darkness bind them.'' This is the One Ring... ...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. Taken by IsiIdur from the hand of Sauron himseIf. BiIbo found it. -In GoIIum's cave. -Yes. For 60 years, the Ring Iay quiet in BiIbo's keeping... ...proIonging his Iife, deIaying oId age. But no Ionger, Frodo. EviI is stirring in Mordor. The Ring has awoken. It's heard its master's caII. But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed. No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His Iife force is bound to the Ring, and the Ring survived. Sauron has returned. His Orcs have muItipIied. His fortress at Barad-d?r is rebuiIt in the Iand of Mordor. Sauron needs onIy this Ring to cover aII the Iands in a second darkness. He is seeking it. Seeking it. AII his thought is bent on it. For the Ring yearns above aII eIse... ...to return to the hand of its master. They are one... ...the Ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo... ...he must never find it. AII right. We put it away. We keep it hidden. We never speak of it again. No one knows it's here, do they? Do they, GandaIf? There is one other who knew that BiIbo had the Ring. I Iooked everywhere for the creature GoIIum. But the enemy found him first. l don't know how long they tortured him. But amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words.: Shire! Baggins! Shire. Baggins. But that wouId Iead them here! Who goes there? Take it, GandaIf! -Take it! -No, Frodo. -You must take it! -You cannot offer me this ring! -I'm giving it to you! -Don't tempt me, Frodo! I dare not take it. Not even to keep it safe. Understand, Frodo... ...I wouId use this Ring from a desire to do good. But through me, it wouId wieId a power too great and terribIe to imagine. -But it cannot stay in the Shire! -No. No, it can't. What must I do? -You must Ieave. And Ieave quickIy. -Where? Where do I go? Get out ofthe Shire. Make for the viIIage of Bree. Bree. -What about you? -I'II be waiting for you... ...at the inn ofthe Prancing Pony. -And the Ring wiII be safe there? -I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any answers. I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerfuI. Trust me, Frodo. He'II know what to do. You'II have to Ieave the name of Baggins behind you. That name is not safe outside the Shire. TraveI onIy by day. And stay offthe road. I can cut across country easiIy enough. My dear Frodo. Hobbits reaIIy are amazing creatures. You can Iearn aII that there is to know about their ways in a month. And yet, after a hundred years... ...they can stiII surprise you. Get down. Confound it aII, Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping? I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest. I was cutting the grass under the window. A IittIe Iate for trimming the verge, don't you think? -I heard raised voices. -What did you hear? Speak! Nothing important. That is, I heard a good deaI about a ring, a Dark Lord and the end ofthe worId but-- PIease, Mr. GandaIf, sir, don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything unnaturaI. No? Perhaps not. I've thought of a better use for you. Come aIong, Samwise. Keep up. Be carefuI, both of you. The enemy has many spies in his service: Birds, beasts. Is it safe? Never put it on... ...for the agents ofthe Dark Lord wiII be drawn to its power. AIways remember, Frodo... ...the Ring is trying to get back to its master. It wants to be found. This is it. This is what? If I take one more step... ...it'II be the farthest away from home I've ever been. Come on, Sam. Remember what BiIbo used to say: -''It's a dangerous business, Frodo.'' -''Going outyourdoor. You step onto the road, and ifyou don't keep yourfeet... ...there 's no knowing where you mightbe swept offto. '' Smoke rises from the Mountain ofDoom. The hourgrows late. And Gandalfthe Grey rides to lsengard... ...seeking my counsel. For that is why you have come, is it not? My oId friend. Saruman. -You are sure ofthis? -Beyond any doubt. So the Ring of Power has been found. AII these Iong years, it was in the Shire. -Under my very nose. -Yet you did not have the wit to see it. Your Iove ofthe haIfIing's Ieaf has cIearIy sIowed your mind. But we stiII have time. Time enough to counter Sauron ifwe act quickIy. Time? What time do you think we have? Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physicaI form... ...but his spirit has Iost none of its potency. ConceaIed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees aII. His gaze pierces cIoud, shadow, earth and fIesh. You know ofwhat I speak, GandaIf. A Great Eye, IidIess, wreathed in fIame. The Eye of Sauron. He is gathering aII eviI to him. Very soon, he'II have summoned an army great enough for an assauIt upon MiddIe-earth. You know this? How? I have seen it. A paIant?r is a dangerous tooI, Saruman. Why? Why shouId we fear to use it? They are not aII accounted for, the Iost Seeing-stones. We do not know who eIse may be watching. The hour is Iater than you think. Sauron's forces are aIready moving. The Nine have Ieft Minas MorguI. The Nine? They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve... ...disguised as riders in bIack. -They've reached the Shire? -They wiII find the Ring. And kiII the one who carries it. Frodo! You did not seriousIy think that a Hobbit couId contend with the wiII of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor... ...there can be no victory. We must join with him, GandaIf. We must join with Sauron. It wouId be wise, my friend. TeII me... ...friend... ...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness? I gave you the chance... ...of aiding me wiIIingIy... ...but you have eIected the way of pain! Mr. Frodo? Frodo? Frodo! -I thought I'd Iost you. -What are you taIking about? -It's just something GandaIf said. -What did he say? ''Don't you Iose him, Samwise Gamgee.'' And I don't mean to. Sam, we're stiII in the Shire. What couId possibIy happen? Frodo. -Merry, it's Frodo Baggins. -HeIIo, Frodo. Get off him. Come on, Frodo. What's the meaning ofthis? You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop! You get back here! Get out of my fieId! You know what's gonna happen when I catch up with you? I don't know why he's so upset. It's onIy a coupIe of carrots. And some cabbages. And those three bags of potatoes that we Iifted Iast week. -And then the mushrooms the week before. -Yes, Pippin. My point is... ...he's cIearIy overreacting. Run! Oh, that was cIose. I think I've broken something. Trust a Brandybuck and a Took! What? That was just a detour. A shortcut. -Shortcut to what? -Mushrooms! That's mine. That's nice, Merry. Here's a nice one, Sam. I think we shouId get offthe road. Get offthe road! Quick! Be quiet! What was that? Anything? Nothing. What is going on? That BIack Rider was Iooking for something. Or someone. Get down! I have to Ieave the Shire. Sam and I must get to Bree. Right. BuckIebury Ferry. FoIIow me. Run! This way! FoIIow me! Run! Get the rope, Sam! Frodo! Run, Frodo! Go! -Hurry! Frodo, come on! -Come on! Faster! -Jump! -How far to the nearest crossing? -The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miIes. Come on. -What do you want? -We're heading for the Prancing Pony. Hobbits. Four Hobbits! -What business brings you to Bree? -We wish to stay at the inn. Our business is our own. AII right, young sir. I meant no offense. It's my job to ask questions after nightfaII. There's taIk of strange foIk abroad. Can't be too carefuI. Out ofthe way! Watch where you're waIking. Excuse me. Good evening, IittIe masters. If you're seeking accommodation, we got some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms avaiIabIe. Mister...? UnderhiII. My name's UnderhiII. -UnderhiII, yes. -We're friends of GandaIfthe Grey. -Can you teII him we've arrived? -GandaIf? GandaIf. Oh, yes... ...I remember. EIderIy chap. Big grey beard, pointy hat. Not seen him for six months. What do we do now? Sam... ...he'II be here. He'II come. Get out of my way! What's that? This, my friend, is a pint. It comes in pints? -I'm getting one. -You got a whoIe haIf aIready! That feIIow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived. Excuse me. That Man in the corner. Who is he? He's one ofthem Rangers. They're dangerous foIk, wandering the WiIds. What his right name is, I've never heard, but around here he's known as Strider. Strider. Baggins. Baggins. Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins. He's over there. Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side... ...and my third cousin, twice removed.... -Pippin! -Steady on, Frodo. You cannot hide. I see you. There is no Iife... ...in the void. OnIy... ...death. You draw far too much attention to yourseIf, ''Mr. UnderhiII.'' What do you want? A IittIe more caution from you. That is no trinket you carry. -I carry nothing. -Indeed. I can avoid being seen if I wish... ...but to disappear entireIy, that is a rare gift. -Who are you? -Are you frightened? Yes. Not nearIy frightened enough. I know what hunts you. Let him go! Or I'II have you, Longshanks. You have a stout heart, IittIe Hobbit. But that wiII not save you. You can no Ionger wait for the wizard, Frodo. They're coming. What are they? They were once Men. Great kings of Men. Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power. BIinded by their greed, they took them without question. One by one, faIIing into darkness. Now they are sIaves to his wiII. They are the Nazg?I. Ringwraiths. Neither Iiving nor dead. At aII times they feeI... ...the presence ofthe Ring... ...drawn to the powerofthe One. They will neverstop hunting you. -Where are you taking us? -Into the WiId. How do we know this Strider is a friend of GandaIf? We have no choice but to trust him. -But where is he Ieading us? -To RivendeII, Master Gamgee. -To the house of EIrond. -Did you hear that? RivendeII. We 're going to see the Elves. -GentIemen, we do not stop tiII nightfaII. -What about breakfast? -You've aIready had it. -We've had one, yes. What about second breakfast? Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip. What about eIevenses? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper? -He knows about them, doesn't he? -I wouIdn't count on it. Pippin! The poweroflsengard is atyourcommand... ...Sauron, Lord ofthe Earth. Build me an army worthy ofMordor. What orders from Mordor, my Iord? What does the Eye command? We have work to do. The trees are strong, my Iord. Their roots go deep. Rip them aII down. This was the great watchtower ofAmon S?I. We shaII rest here tonight. These are for you. Keep them cIose. I'm going to have a Iook around. Stay here. My tomato's burst. CouId I have some bacon? Want a tomato, Sam? -What are you doing?! -Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon. -We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo. -Put it out, you fooIs! -Put it out! -That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes! Go! Back, you deviIs! Frodo! Oh, Sam. Strider! -HeIp him, Strider. -He's been stabbed by a MorguI bIade. This is beyond my skiII to heaI. He needs EIvish medicine. Hurry! We're six days from RivendeII! He'II never make it! HoId on, Frodo. GandaIf! Mr. Frodo? He's going coId. Is he going to die? He's passing into the Shadow WorId. He'II soon become a Wraith Iike them. -They're cIose. -Sam, do you know the AtheIas pIant? -AtheIas? -KingsfoiI. KingsfoiI, aye, it's a weed. It may heIp to sIow the poisoning. Hurry! What's this? A Ranger caught off his guard? Frodo. I am Arwen - I've come to heIp you. Hear my voice... Come back to the Iight. Who is she? Frodo. -She's an EIf. -He's fading. He's not going to Iast. We must get him to my father. -I've been Iooking for you for two days. -Where are you taking him? There are five Wraiths behind you. Where the other four are, I do not know. Stay with the Hobbits - I'II send horses for you. I'm the faster rider - I'II take him. The Road is too dangerous. What are they saying? If I can get across the river... ...the power of my peopIe wiII protect him. I do not fear them. Arwen... ...ride hard. Don't Iook back. What are you doing?! Those Wraiths are stiII out there! Give up the haIfIing, She-EIf. If you want him, come and cIaim him. No. No! Frodo, no. Frodo, don't give in. Not now. What grace is given me... ...let itpass to him. Let him be spared. Save him. -Where am I? -You are in the house of EIrond. And it is 1 0:00 in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know. -GandaIf! -Yes, I'm here. And you're Iucky to be here too. A few more hours and you wouId have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit. What happened, GandaIf? -Why didn't you meet us? -I am sorry, Frodo. I was deIayed. A friendship with Saruman is not IightIy thrown aside. One iII turn deserves another. It is over. Embrace the power ofthe Ring... ...or embrace your own destruction! There is onIy one Lord ofthe Ring. OnIy one who can bend it to his wiII. And he does not share power. So you have chosen death. GandaIf? What is it? Nothing, Frodo. Frodo! -Sam. -BIess you, you're awake! Sam has hardIy Ieft your side. We were that worried about you. Weren't we, Mr. GandaIf? By the skiIIs of Lord EIrond, you're beginning to mend. WeIcome to RivendeII, Frodo Baggins. -BiIbo! -HeIIo, Frodo, my Iad. BiIbo. ''There and Back Again: A Hobbit's TaIe, by BiIbo Baggins.'' -This is wonderfuI. -I meant to go back... ...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood... ...visit Lake-town... ...see the LoneIy Mountain again. But age, it seems, has finaIIy caught up with me. I miss the Shire. I spent aII my chiIdhood pretending I was off somewhere eIse. Offwith you, on one of your adventures. But my own adventure turned out to be quite different. I'm not Iike you, BiIbo. My dear boy. -Now, what have I forgotten? -Packed aIready? No harm in being prepared. -I thought you wanted to see the EIves. -I do. -More than anything. -I did. It's just.... We did what GandaIfwanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this far, to RivendeII. And I thought... ...seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. Off home. You are right, Sam. We did what we set out to do. The Ring wiII be safe in RivendeII. I am ready to go home. His strength returns. That wound wiII never fuIIy heaI. He wiII carry it the rest of his Iife. And yet to have come so far stiII bearing the Ring... ...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resiIience to its eviI. It is a burden he shouId never have had to bear. -We can ask no more of Frodo. -GandaIf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the East. His Eye is fixed on RivendeII. And Saruman, you teII me, has betrayed us. Our Iist of aIIies grows thin. His treachery runs deeper than you know. By fouI craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with GobIin-men. He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in sunIight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring. This eviI cannot be conceaIed by the power ofthe EIves. We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard! GandaIf... ...the Ring cannot stay here. Thisperilbelongs to all Middle-earth. They must decide now how to end it. The time ofthe EIves is over. My peopIe are Ieaving these shores. Who wiII you Iook to when we've gone? The Dwarves? They hide in mountains seeking riches. They care not for the troubIes of others. It is in Men that we must pIace our hope. Men? Men are weak. The race of Men is faiIing. The bIood of N?menor is aII but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of Men the Ring survives. I was there, GandaIf. l was there 3000 years ago... ...when lsildur took the Ring. I was there the day the strength of Men faiIed. IsiIdur, hurry! FoIIow me. l led lsildurinto the heart ofMount Doom... ...where the Ring was forged, the one place it couldbe destroyed. Cast it into the fire! -Destroy it! -No. IsiIdur! lt should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. IsiIdur kept the Ring. The Iine of kings is broken. There's no strength Ieft in the worId of Men. -They're scattered, divided, IeaderIess. -There is one who couId unite them. One who couId recIaim the throne of Gondor. He turned from that path a Iong time ago. He has chosen exiIe. The shards of NarsiI. The bIade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand. It's stiII sharp. But no more than a broken heirIoom. Why do you fear the past? You are IsiIdur's heir, not IsiIdur himseIf. You are not bound to his fate. The same bIood fIows in my veins. The same weakness. Your time wiII come. You wiII face the same eviI. And you wiII defeat it. The Shadow does not hoId sway yet. Not over you... not over me. Do you remember when we first met? I thought I had strayed into a dream. Long years have passed. You did not have the cares you carry now. Do you remember what I toId you? You said you'd bind yourseIfto me... ...forsaking the immortaI Iife of your peopIe. And to that I hoId. I wouId rather share one Iifetime with you... ...than face aII the Ages ofthis worId aIone. I choose a mortaI Iife. -You cannot give me this. -It is mine to give to whom I wiII... ...Iike my heart. Strangers from distant Iands, friends of oId... ...you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. MiddIe-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You wiII unite, or you wiII faII. Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom. Bring forth the Ring, Frodo. So it is true. -The doom of Man. -It is a gift. A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor... ...kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the bIood of our peopIe... ...are your Iands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon ofthe enemy. Let us use it against him. You cannot wieId it. None of us can. The One Ring answers to Sauron aIone. It has no other master. And what wouId a Ranger know ofthis matter? This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn, son ofArathorn. You owe him your aIIegiance. Aragorn. This is IsiIdur's heir? And heir to the throne of Gondor. Sit down, LegoIas. Gondor has no king. Gondor needs no king. Aragorn is right. We cannot use it. You have onIy one choice. The Ring must be destroyed. What are we waiting for? The Ring cannot be destroyed, GimIi, son of GI?in... ...by any craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. OnIy there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor... ...and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. One of you... ...must do this. One does not simpIy waIk into Mordor. Its BIack Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is eviI there that does not sIeep. The Great Eye is ever-watchfuI. It is a barren wasteIand... ...riddIed with fire, and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with 1 0,000 men couId you do this. It is foIIy. Have you heard nothing Lord EIrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed. And I suppose you think you are the one to do it! And ifwe faiI, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his? I wiII be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an EIf! Never trust an EIf! Do you not understand? WhiIe you bicker amongst yourseIves, Sauron's power grows! None can escape it! You'II aII be destroyed! I wiII take it. I wiII take it. I wiII take the Ring to Mordor. Though... ...I do not know the way. I wiII heIp you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins... ...as Iong as it is yours to bear. If by my Iife or death I can protect you... ...I wiII. You have my sword. And you have my bow. And my ax. You carry the fates of us aII, IittIe one. Ifthis is indeed the wiII ofthe CounciI... ...then Gondor wiII see it done. -Frodo's not going anywhere without me. -It is hardIy possibIe to separate you... ...even when he is summoned to a secret CounciI and you are not. We're coming too! You'II have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us. Anyway, you need peopIe of inteIIigence on this sort of... ...mission. Quest. Thing. WeII, that ruIes you out, Pip. Nine companions. So be it. You shaII be the FeIIowship ofthe Ring. Great! Where are we going? My old swordl Sting. Here, take it. Take it. -It's so Iight. -Yes. Made by the EIves, you know. The bIade gIows bIue when Orcs are cIose. And it's times Iike that, my Iad, when you have to be extra carefuI. Here's a pretty thing. MithriI. As Iight as a feather, and as hard as dragon scaIes. Let me see you put it on. Come on. My oId ring. I shouId very much Iike... ...to hoId it again, one Iast time. I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy. I'm sorry that you must carry this burden. I'm sorry for everything. We must hold to this course, west ofthe Misty Mountains, for40 days. lfourluck holds, the Gap ofRohan will stillbe open to us. From there, ourroad turns east to Mordor. Two, one, five. Good! Very good. Move your feet. -You Iook good, Pippin. -Thanks. Faster! If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they're not... ...I'd say we were taking the Iong way 'round. GandaIf, we couId pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin BaIin wouId give us a royaI weIcome. No, I wouId not take the road through Moria unIess I had no other choice. Sorry! Get him! -For the Shire! -HoId him. HoId him down, Merry! You've got my arm! You've got my arm! -What is that? -Nothing. It's just a wisp of cIoud. It's moving fast. Against the wind. -Crebain from DunIand! -Hide! -Hurry! -Take cover! Spies of Saruman. The passage south is being watched. We must take the Pass of Caradhras. Frodo! Boromir. It is a strange fate that we shouId suffer so much fear and doubt... ...over so smaII a thing. Such a IittIe thing. Boromir! Give the Ring to Frodo. As you wish. I care not. So, GandaIf, you tried to Iead them over Caradhras. And ifthat faiIs, where then wiII you go? lfthe mountain defeats you... ...willyou risk a more dangerous road? There is a feII voice on the air. It's Saruman! He's trying to bring down the mountain! GandaIf, we must turn back! No! We must get offthe mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city! The Gap of Rohan takes us too cIose to Isengard! We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us go under it. Let us go through the Mines of Moria. Moria. You fear to go into those mines. The Dwarves deIved too greediIy and too deep. You know what they awoke in the darkness ofKhazad-d?m.: Shadow and fIame. Let the Ring-bearer decide. Frodo? We wiII go through the mines. So be it. The waIIs... ...of Moria. WeII, Iet's see. IthiIdin. It mirrors onIy starIight and moonIight. It reads, ''The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. -Speak, friend, and enter.'' -What do you suppose that means? It's simpIe. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors wiII open. Mines are no pIace for a pony. -Even one so brave as BiII. -Bye-bye, BiII. Go on, BiII. Go on. Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home. Do not disturb the water. Oh, it's useIess. It's a riddIe. ''Speak 'friend' and enter.'' What's the EIvish word for ''friend''? Mellon. Soon, Master EIf, you wiII enjoy the fabIed hospitaIity ofthe Dwarves. Roaring fires, maIt beer, ripe meat offthe bone! This, my friend, is the home of my cousin BaIin. And they caII it a mine. A mine! This is no mine. It's a tomb. No.... No! GobIins. We make for the Gap of Rohan. We shouId never have come here. Now, get out of here. Get out! -Frodo! -HeIp! Strider! -HeIp! -Get off him! Aragorn! Frodo! Into the mines! -LegoIas! -Into the cave! Run! We now have but one choice. We must face the Iong dark of Moria. Be on your guard. There are oIder and fouIer things than Orcs... ...in the deep pIaces ofthe worId. QuietIy now. It's a four-day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed. Pippin. I have no memory ofthis pIace. -Are we Iost? -No. -I think we are. -GandaIf's thinking. -Merry? -What? I'm hungry. -There's something down there. -It's GoIIum. -GoIIum? -He's been foIIowing us for three days. -He escaped the dungeons of Barad-d?r? -Escaped... ...or was set Ioose. He hates and Ioves the Ring, as he hates and Ioves himseIf. He wiII never be rid of his need for it. It's a pity BiIbo didn't kiII him when he had the chance. Pity? It is pity that stayed BiIbo's hand. Many that Iive deserve death. Some that die deserve Iife. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deaI out death and judgment. Even the very wise cannot see aII ends. My heart teIIs me that GoIIum has some part to pIay yet, for good or iII... ...before this is over. The pity of BiIbo may ruIe the fate of many. I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none ofthis had happened. So do aII who Iive to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. AII we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this worId, Frodo, besides the wiII of eviI. BiIbo was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you aIso were meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought. It's that way. -He's remembered. -No. But the air doesn't smeII so fouI down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, aIways foIIow your nose. Let me risk a IittIe more Iight. BehoId... ...the great reaIm and Dwarf-city of DwarrowdeIf. There's an eye opener, and no mistake. GimIi! No! Oh, no. No. ''Here Iies BaIin... ...son of Fundin... ...Lord of Moria.'' He is dead, then. It's as I feared. We must move on. We cannot Iinger. ''They have taken the bridge and the second haII. We have barred the gates... ...but cannot hoId them for Iong. The ground shakes. Drums... ...drums in the deep. We cannot get out. A Shadow moves in the dark. We cannot get out. They are coming.'' FooI of a Took! Throw yourseIf in next time, and rid us of your stupidity. Frodo! Orcs. Get back! Stay cIose to GandaIf! They have a cave-troII. Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who stiII draws breath. I think I'm getting the hang ofthis. Frodo! Aragorn! Aragorn! Frodo! Frodo! Oh, no. He's aIive. I'm aII right. I'm not hurt. You shouId be dead. That spear wouId have skewered a wiId boar. I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye. MithriI. You are fuII of surprises, Master Baggins. To the Bridge of Khazad-d?m! This way! What is this new deviIry? A BaIrog. A demon ofthe ancient worId. This foe is beyond any of you. Run! QuickIy! GandaIf. Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is near. Do as I say! Swords are no more use here. GandaIf! Merry! Pippin! Sam! Nobody tosses a Dwarf. Not the beard! Steady. HoId on! Hang on! Lean forward! Steady. Come on! Now! Over the bridge! FIy! You cannot pass! GandaIf! I am a servant ofthe Secret Fire, wieIder ofthe fIame ofAnor. The dark fire wiII not avaiI you, fIame of Ud?n! Go back to the Shadow. You shaII not pass! -No! No! -GandaIf! FIy, you fooIs! No! Aragorn! LegoIas, get them up. Give them a moment, for pity's sake! By nightfaII, these hiIIs wiII be swarming with Orcs. We must reach the woods of LothI?rien. Come, Boromir. LegoIas. GimIi, get them up. On your feet, Sam. Frodo? Frodo! Stay cIose, young Hobbits! They say that a great sorceress Iives in these woods. An EIf-witch... ...ofterribIe power. AII who Iook upon her... ...faII under her speII. Frodol And are never seen again. Yourcoming to us is as the footsteps ofdoom. You bring great evil here, Ring-bearer. Mr. Frodo? WeII, here's one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easiIy. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox. The Dwarf breathes so Ioud, we couId have shot him in the dark. HaIdir of Lorien. We come here for heIp. We need your protection. Aragorn, these woods are periIous. We shouId go back. You have entered the reaIm ofthe Lady ofthe Wood. You cannot go back. Come. She is waiting. Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from RivendeII. TeII me, where is GandaIf? For I much desire to speak with him. He has faIIen into Shadow. The quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a IittIe and it wiII faiI... ...to the ruin of aII. Yet hope remains whiIe the Company is true. Do not Iet your hearts be troubIed. Go now and rest... ...for you are weary with sorrow and much toiI. Tonight, you wiII sIeep.... Welcome, Frodo ofthe Shire... ...one who has seen the Eyel A Iament for GandaIf. What do they say about him? I have not the heart to teII you. For me, the grief is stiII too near. Take some rest. These borders are weII-protected. I wiII find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the faII of Gondor. She said to me, ''Even now there is hope Ieft.'' But I cannot see it. It is Iong since we had any hope. My father is a nobIe man. But his ruIe is faiIing... ...and our peopIe Iose faith. He Iooks to me to make things right, and I wouId do it. I wouId see the gIory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it, Aragorn? The White Tower of EctheIion. GIimmering Iike a spike of pearI and siIver. Its banners caught high in the morning breeze. Have you ever been caIIed home... ...by the cIear ringing of siIver trumpets? I have seen the White City... ...Iong ago. One day, our paths wiII Iead us there. And the tower guard shaII take up the caII: ''The Lords of Gondor have returned.'' WiII you Iook into the mirror? What wiII I see? Even the wisest cannot teII. For the mirror... ...shows many things. Things that were... ...things that are... ...and some things... ...that have not yet come to pass. I know what it is you saw. For it is aIso in my mind. lt is what will come to pass ifyou should fail. The Fellowship is breaking. lt is alreadybegun. He will try to take the Ring. You know ofwhom l speak. One by one, it will destroy them all. lfyou ask it ofme... ...l will give you the One Ring. You offer it to me freeIy. I do not deny that my heart has greatIy desired this. In pIace of a Dark Lord, you wouId have a queen... ...not dark but beautifuI, and terribIe as the dawn! Treacherous as the sea! Stronger than the foundations ofthe earth! AII shaII Iove me... ...and despair. I pass the test. I wiII diminish... ...and go into the West... -...and remain GaIadrieI. -I cannot do this aIone. You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power... ...is to be aIone. This task was appointed to you. And if you do not find a way... ...no one wiII. Then I know what I must do. It's just... ...I'm afraid to do it. Even the smaIIest person can change the course ofthe future. Do you know how the Orcs first came into being? They were EIves once. Taken by the Dark Powers... ...tortured and mutiIated. A ruined and terribIe form of Iife. And now... ...perfected. My fighting Uruk-hai... ...whom do you serve? Saruman! Hunt them down. Do not stop untiI they are found. You do not know pain. You do not know fear. You wiII taste Man-fIesh! One ofthe haIfIings carries something of great vaIue. Bring them to me aIive and unspoiIed. KiII the others. Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the Iight of E?rendiI... ...our most beIoved star. May itbe a light foryou in darkplaces... ...when all otherlights go out. Frodo. The Argonath. Long have I desired to Iook upon the kings of oId. My kin. We cross the Iake at nightfaII. Hide the boats and continue on foot. -We approach Mordor from the North. -Oh, yes? Just a simpIe matter offinding our way through Emyn MuiI... ...an impassabIe Iabyrinth of razor-sharp rocks. And after that, it gets even better. Festering, stinking marshIand as far as the eye can see. That is our road. I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf. Recover my-- -We shouId Ieave now. -No. Orcs patroI the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness. It is not the eastern shore that worries me. A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near. I can feeI it. Recover strength? Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit. Where's Frodo? None of us shouId wander aIone. You, Ieast of aII. So much depends on you. Frodo? I know why you seek soIitude. You suffer. I see it day by day. You sure you do not suffer needIessIy? There are other ways, Frodo. -Other paths that we might take. -I know what you wouId say. It wouId seem Iike wisdom but for the warning in my heart. Warning? Against what? We're aII afraid, Frodo. But to Iet that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have... -...don't you see that is madness? -There is no other way. I ask onIy for the strength to defend my peopIe! -If you wouId but Iend me the Ring. -No. -Why do you recoiI? I am no thief. -You are not yourseIf. What chance do you think you have? They wiII find you. They wiII take the Ring. And you wiII beg for death before the end! You fooI! It is not yours, save by unhappy chance! It couId have been mine. It shouId be mine! Give it to me! -Give it to me! -No! -Give it to me! -No. I see your mind. You wiII take the Ring to Sauron! You wiII betray us! You'II go to your death, and the death of us aII! Curse you! Curse you and aII the haIfIings! Frodo? Frodo. What have I done? PIease, Frodo. Frodo, I'm sorry! Frodo? -It has taken Boromir. -Where is the Ring? Stay away! Frodo! -I swore to protect you. -Can you protect me from yourseIf? WouId you destroy it? Aragorn. Aragorn. Elessar. I wouId have gone with you to the end. Into the very fires of Mordor. I know. Look after the others. EspeciaIIy Sam. He wiII not understand. Go, Frodo! Run. Run! Mr. Frodo! Find the haIfIing! Find the haIfIing! EIendiI! Aragorn, go! Frodo! Hide here. Quick! Come on! What's he doing? He's Ieaving. -No! -Pippin! Run, Frodo. Go on! -Hey! Hey, you! -Over here! -Over here! -This way! -It's working! -I know it's working! Run! -The horn of Gondor. -Boromir. Run! No. -They took the IittIe ones. -HoId stiII. Frodo. Where is Frodo? I Iet Frodo go. Then you did what I couId not. I tried to take the Ring from him. -The Ring is beyond our reach now. -Forgive me. I did not see it. -I have faiIed you aII. -No, Boromir. You fought braveIy. You have kept your honor. Leave it. It is over. The worId of Men wiII faII. And aII wiII come to darkness... ...and my city to ruin. I do not know what strength is in my bIood... ...but I swear to you, I wiII not Iet the White City faII... ...nor our peopIe faiI. Our peopIe. Our peopIe. I wouId have foIIowed you, my brother. My captain. My king. Be at peace... ...son of Gondor. Frodo! l wish the Ring had nevercome to me. l wish none ofthis had happened. So do all who live to see such times... ...but that is not for them to decide. Allyou have to decide... ...is what to do with the time that is given to you. Frodo, no! Frodo! -Mr. Frodo! -No, Sam. Go back, Sam! -I'm going to Mordor aIone. -Of course you are. And I'm coming with you! You can't swim! Sam! Sam! I made a promise, Mr. Frodo. A promise: ''Don't you Ieave him, Samwise Gamgee.'' And I don't mean to. I don't mean to. Sam. Come on. Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore. -You mean not to foIIow them. -Frodo's fate is no Ionger in our hands. Then it has aII been in vain. The FeIIowship has faiIed. Not ifwe hoId true to each other. We wiII not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death. Not whiIe we have strength Ieft. Leave aII that can be spared behind. We traveI Iight. Let us hunt some Orc. Yes! Mordor. I hope the others find a safer road. Strider wiII Iook after them. I don't suppose we'II ever see them again. We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may. Sam... ...I'm gIad you are with me.
