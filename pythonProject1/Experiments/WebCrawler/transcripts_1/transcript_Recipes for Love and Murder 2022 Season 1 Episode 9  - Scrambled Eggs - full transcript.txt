Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- [Tannie]Previously on Recipe'’s for Love and Murder... Let's see who needs our help. [thud] [breathing heavily] I have a plan that'll allow my daughter and I to leave. I'll be a real as your story so that's not more important than actually finding the killer. [Jessie]Two citizens been murdered and the big bad detective has no idea who did it. You ask a lot of questions. She's a reporter, it's her job. [instrumental music] My cousin that works at Koop wants to talk about Martine. -What about her? -He didn't say. That's why I'm going over there. I see your tabloid has run another article highlighting a black worker claiming he's been mistreated. I finally got that bloody lawyer on the phone. Paper work's ready. The three Koop franchises, we spoke about it. Robertson Worcester 'O Siris, all yours. [growls] [suspenseful music] [engine revving] [Tannie]The car... here. Many gold four by fours are there in this town. [tires screeching] I miss you. Miss talking about the old days. I'll make it. I'm married though. [beeps] How was that? Fairly convincing. [eerie music] [exhales sharply] So... We're agreed? Aye. I don't see what any other options we have. -And if you're right about the-- -I'm right. Her mother died two months before Mickey did. Then we have to do what's right. For Mickey. Right then. [theme music] [chopping] [music continues] [music continues] Did she, uh, tell Bronwyn anything about when she'd be home? Hm-hm... nothing. We still haven't been able to reach Jared. He swopped out his shift at the hotel last night. Are there any other family members you could call? [thud] Call whoever you like. I understand that you're upset. We're doing everything that we can to-- My daughter is out there. Probably in the hands of a killer. Why are you two still sitting in my living room? When you should be out there looking for her. Mommy? We won't rest until we find her, Celine. Dead or alive? [mellow music] [Tannie] The last time anyone saw her was when she dropped her sister home. Maria said she was going to meet her cousin at the Koop. Were you able to find the cousin? ...email any work after that? Did you pull all of her phone records? I should've gone with her to the Koop. -Keep in comms. -Okay. Okay. You're going to tell me everything that you know. Maybe you should just try to go to sleep. Sleep? You have used all sorts of bogus excuses to keep us out of the investigation and now Jessie is missing. She's might even be... [crickets chirping] We're going to talk. And we're going to do so right now. All our cops are on the ground now. With more coming from Montagu and Robertson. So let us know if you hear anything, or think of anything else. Thank you, Piet. Bring her back to me. I should've stopped her. All this investigative business. No! Ma... no. I should've put a stop to that. Ma... nobody can stop Jessie when she's decided on something. It's gonna be okay. [sobbing] Sounds like the only thing that you and Jessie did not know about was the money. The money? Martine deposited small amounts of money adding up to 100,000 into a new account weeks before her death. F-f-from... Well, there's lot of people that we know it wasn't. Dirk... Anna... -Marius Rabie? -No, it doesn't seem likely. We checked his alibis for both murders. And Piet's looking into the finances in case. She wrote to me that... she had a plan for her and her daughter to leave Dirk. Well, a hundred thousand rands will definitely help you with that. [Mrs. Stewart]It's a very small piece of land really. Your great aunt sold the farmland off about a decade ago. [chuckles] She probably got too old to run after sheep. [chuckles] I know the house. There's a beautiful garden. Well, your mother would never sell. Nostalgic business about growing up there. I've spoken to the realtor there. And I think it will sell very quickly. I won't be selling either. [mellow music] What... [gasps] Hattie! What? Jessie's boots! -Any sign of forced entry? -Not that I've seen. -Who has the keys? -Umm... Me, Maria, Jessie a-a-and Doep. If someone has Jessie they could've taken her keys. [mellow music] Fried. That will really ruin your pan. What kind of person do you have to be... The Koop will be open soon, I'm going to go there see if anyone saw her yesterday. Maria, there are cops there this morning interviewing the warehouse staff, you should stay with me. 'Cause you've done such a great job of keeping us safe so far? Jessie's already missing. You want to join her? -You should listen to me. -I have been listening to you. -I'm trying to protect you. -I don't need protecting! I think he's just trying to help, Maria. Good, but, I'm going to the last place I know my friend went. [gasps] You be careful, Maria. [suspenseful music] [breathing heavily] [indistinct chatter] Is Jared September at work today? Good morning, can I help you? Is Jared September at work today? -I already talked to the cops. -I'm not a cop. I'm afraid he's not on the schedule for today. I'm sorry about your friend, eh. Police said she's missing. -Did you see Jared yesterday? -Yes. But there was nothing unusual, he was just working. Took a few smoke breaks. -And Jessie? Did you see her? -I don't think so. -You don't think so? -I often see her here. But I think the last time I noticed Jessie was... A few days ago, she was in here with her brother and sister arguing about... that I suppose or something. -Could I see Martine's office? -I don't know about that. That you must ask Mr. Van Wyk. He's on his way. -Okay, thank you. -Thank you. You make sure you knock on every door on that side. You do the same this way. Okay? [phone ringing] -Hey -Hey, dad, how's the murder? It's not a joke, Khazi. Jeez, it's not my fault your job is gross. Listen, things are hectic here, what do you need? -Is everything okay? -Well, there's woman is missing. And most likely the murderer has her. What do you need? Is 500 rand enough? Yeah, 500 is fine. I-I-I hope you find her. Me too. [sheep bleats] [intense music] [engine revving] -Morning, sir. -Morning. -Should you be here? -It's my shift, sir. Your girlfriend is missing. You haven't rested. -I'm not going to. -I understand that. But are you able to fulfil your police duties-- Please, okay. I need to be here. I need to find her, I'm taking the calls and I'm dealing with walk ins, but I'll escalate to Piet if need be. But I have to be here. The briefing packs for Robertson, do you have them? Yes, sir, it's... um, it's packed and ready. -If Maria-- -Should I... Should I get her on the phone for you, sir? No, you call her. Just make sure she's okay. She'll hate it if I do it. [mellow music] Thought your colleague who was the investigator. Always zooming around town on that lil' scooter of hers. Digging for clues. -We're a team. -Oh! Yeah. This's the first time anyone's been in here since the police. [phone buzzing] Found any clues, Tannie Sherlock? [paper rustling] [music continues] Mr. Rabie, I wasn't expecting you. Perhaps you've been underestimating me. I'm sure I don't know what you mean. I should've expect you to act all innocent. -But I'm on to you. -Mr. Rabie. I'm having an incredibly stressful day. Because my colleague and friend is missing presumed kidnapped by a known killer. So if you have something to s-say, can you just say it? Typical woman. Trying to use your emotions on me. This is why you'll never succeed as chair of the business forum. [laughs] You really are pathetic, aren't you? You can keep your business forum, Mr. Rabie. I know all about your plans. I'm going to meet with Mr. Van Wyk today to ensure that we put a stop to this uprising. Could you just leave now? You'll be sorry. I'm sorry about a lot of things. Upsetting you is never gonna be one of them. [sniffles] [mellow music] [sobbing] You can't lock me up forever. No... But you'll probably get about six months or so. For what, being a better shot than Dirk? Unlicensed firearm? Reckless endangerment? Then there's a few years for stealing an ambulance. We were always going to give it back. Assaulting a police officer. There's definitely a few months for that. I'm not sure about the charges concerning John, but... the boss is talking about conspiracy to commit murder. You don't know what it's like. Losing the love of your life. Nothing matters anymore. [music continues] Step away. [metal clinking] -I want Tannie Maria. -Hey! We're not playing these games with you anymore, okay? -I'll only talk to her. -She's busy. I really don't think there's a story here. Well, you can go, I can lock up after. Security first, I'm afraid. I won't steal anything, I promise you. Okay, look, ahem, I do have a meeting coming up very soon. I'm going to have to do some preparation for it. Thank you. You've been very kind. I-I'll get out of your hair straight away. Hope this wasn't a waste of time. No, definitely not! [suspenseful music] [Piet]Boss! -It's not Marius. -Definitely not? He handed over his financials willingly. That might be arrogance. The forensic accountants seems satisfied. Guy might be criminal in other regards, but I have to admit... his books are clean. Every cent accounted for. Plus he has alibis for both murders. -Could have hired someone. -I really don't think so. Maria? Did Regardt speak to her? She's not picking up. But I'll send a car over to her house. -Maybe she's just be mad at us. -At me you mean. Oh, yes boss, I thought it would be rude to say so.

I couldn't tell you. Sometimes wish Martine had never written to her. I'd hate for Jessie and Maria to be killed just because... Please tell your uncle that, uh, it's a kind offer. But I don't think money will help. He's willing to offer a big reward. Big rewards for information lead to big lies. No, I understand, you might not have faith in our policing but we're trying everything in our power to solve this case. I know, we just thought that... Jared, thanks for calling back. You also need to eat, Bronnie. [glass clinking] [knocking on door] I'm so sorry, Auntie Charlene. I was out of town, and I had no idea Jessie was gone until now. [instrumental music] [knocks on door] Dirk? Hello? Maria, Tannie Maria, was she here? Yes, she was in here earlier. She asked me if I'd seen her friend. And she asked if she can see in Martine's office. -Mr. Van Wyk opened it for her. -Is he here? So what else can you tell me? I didn't tell her that I saw Jessie last night. I thought that's a police investigation th-that's not just something you tell the public. And when did you see Jessie? Jessie came in around closing to speak to Jared. -You know what about? -I don't know, they're cousins. Maybe they were just having a catch up. I didn't hear it, but... I think he told Jessie about the pomegranate juice. I only noticed because... I was the one who had to sign for the stock when we take it to the shelves. And everyone kept saying that Martine bought the juice or Anna bought the juice. I told you Anna bought it. Mr. Can Wyk said he was certain, he said he saw her and I thought I remembered it. But I checked. And we never signed the stock onto the shelves. So it was still in the warehouse. Or it should've been. [suspenseful music] There's only one person that can take stock without signing for it. [door rattles] Dirk, it's okay, it's just me. It's just Maria... And that's the boss. Give me the phone. I said give me the phone. Back... move, Tannie Maria, move... move! Come on, that's it. Quickly. That's it, keep going. [eerie music] That's it, keep going. To the car please, Tannie Maria. -Where are we going? -Just somewhere, quiet. 'Til I get back the stuff Martine stole from me. Maybe you know where it is. Where's Jessie? You're a good little girl, maybe your colleague will live. No, no, no, no, you drive. You drive. Quickly. You need to come into the station to make a statement. My shift only finishes at five. You're going to come with me right now. Or I'll arrest you for obstructing justice. There's no need to be like that. I'm not the killer, officer. -Come. -Sheryl, look here. Come, come, come, let's go. I'm a cashier not the killer. Let's go. Why didn't you tell the police this? I told them now. I called them. And I'm gonna go there. But I had to come here and see you, Auntie Charlene. And say sorry. So, you told Jessie first because she wanted to know the scoop. Jessie always wanted to know first. I thought I could give her the headlines. She would've said something last night. [Jared] I didn't have any signal. And I only just got back into town. I'm so sorry, Auntie Charlene. Are you sure? I think it was blackmail. [suspenseful music] I want a lawyer, stop holding me. Piet, I know who paid Martine. I know who drugged the pomegranate juice. -Van Wyk. -Van Wyk. [intense music] [engine revving] [wind howling] [rattling] [creaking] Get out. [door closes] No, not there. You can wait in here. [suspenseful music] [creaking] Jessie? Where is she? -Where is she? -Sorry its stuffy in there. Open, I can see it. [knocking on door] [Maria]Jessie! [knocking] [panting] [sniffles] [intense music] [click] [music continues] [heavy breathing] [rattles] [music continues] [clinks] Not this again. You've got to stop moping over your mum's death. She's only been dead a week. It's sad. I understand. But nobody wants to look at a sad face all day long, do they? Of course not, sorry. Mickey, give it to me. -No, no... -Give it to me. Mickey, don't. No, please, please. The look on your face. Ah! Cheer up love. How would you like your eggs today? [Mickey]Scrambled. I can't really trust you to poach them when you're gonna like this.

[humming] [indistinct shouts] You obviously know Mr. Van Wyk well. Excuse me, there's nothing going on with us. -I'm an engaged woman. -No, no, no. I meant you're smart, you pay attention. Have you ever been to Mr. Van Wyk's house? He had a staff party there two years ago. It's actually lovely. -Oh, so he's a good boss to you. -Yes, he's a good boss. And apart from that time that you were at the house did you ever see Mr. Van Wyk outside of work? Now, I know, that you're not in that kind of a relationship with him. But you're a trusted employee. Well, he took my dad hunting once. [suspenseful music] [rustling] [Piet] Is that something he enjoyed? Hunting. Yeah, my dad said he managed to hit the kudu but he only wounded it. But Van Wyk, yo! He took it down with one hit, my dad was so thrilled. He'd only ever managed to kill something small like a rabbit before. [eerie music] So was there... any particular place that he liked to go hunting? He took my dad to his cabin. Where's this cabin? I don't know. Somewhere in the mountains, but not far. He picked my dad up and then he took him there. -Could you call him and ask him? -I can't. Someone's life is on the line here! He's dead! My dad passed away last year. [metal clinking] [creaking] I'm hungry. [clicks] [Van Wyk]Get up. [suspenseful music] What recipe would you recommend, hmm? [telephone rings] Shut up, you don't say a word, do you hear me? Marius. Did you forget our appointment, Cornel? No, it completely slipped my mind. Something else came up for me at the last minute. Yeah, well, Hattie's planning to overthrow me and she's coming for your job too. No for sure. I'm certain we'll come up with a plan to put Hattie Wilson in her place. Good, I'm sick of the women in this town. Oh, and uh, thanks for the deposit. But uh, when will you be paying the rest? I'm working on it. Ill call you tomorrow. Now as I was saying, I'm hungry. [music continues] [knocking on door] Maria! [clinks] [knocking on door] Maria! [clucking] You tell me where your friend is. You're gonna cook for me. Where's Jessie? What've you done with her? [Van Wyk]Jessie? She interviewed me last night. -Things got a little heated. -Where is she? -I haven't seen her all day. -You're a liar. Dear Tannie Maria an employee of mine wouldn't keep her nose out of my business and when she kept demanding more bribes I had to let her go. [music continues] [footsteps] [keys rattling] [clinking] Ah! Ah, Jessie! Ah! God! [groans] [groans] Open the lid, open it. [thud] Now, fresh. Killed today. Hmm? [Van Wyk chuckles] Killed with this little beauty, hmm?. So, Tannie Maria. When you're ready. [music continues] Martine, Martine is like me, really. She accused me of stealing from the employee's pensions. But then she kept demanding...blackmail money, where did she think that was coming from? Hmm? I was gonna pay everything back as soon as the deal went through. [Van Wyk]I care for my staff, Tannie. But Martine was so very greedy. [Van Wyk]But I had to steal more from the pension fund. She only thinks about herself. I-I-I even took her... her favourite juice, the pomegranate juice. [Van Wyk]She was gonna expose me. She was gonna make sure I was going to prison. Splash my name across all the front pages. [Van Wyk]It's all Martine's fault. Lawrence, Jessie too, all her fault. [music continues] I like my steak medium rare. Now, please! [clicks] [thud] [heavy breathing] -For Jessie. -Oh, Jessie. [laughs] Yeah, she thought she was so damn bright. She didn't even figure out that Martine was blackmailing me. Did she do that? Yeah. [music continues] [Van Wyk] I gotta give you credit. Hmm...you spotted the blackmail. Smart little cookie. [Van Wyk]You see all those carcasses out there in the shed. [sizzling] I did that, I killed everything here. That's how I knew I could do it. That's how I knew I could kill a human. [Van Wyk]Should've used the crossbow though. Thwack! [sighs] I had to make it look like a lover's fight. I knew everyone would blame Dirk. You are charged with weapons and danger, come on. It was her! [sizzling] Maria must've figured out Martine has been blackmailing Van Wyk. [music continues] And Van Wyk found Maria. [sizzling] Lawrence-Lawrence you see, he saw my car when I was dealing with Martine. Thought he was so clever, began to threaten me. No, please, please-- [gunshot] Selfish selfish man. Just like Martine. [sizzling] I was gonna leave it all there. Then you bloody women, you wouldn't let it go. I tried to warn you, I really did. [Van Wyk]I tried to make Hattie listen. If only Hattie would listen. Sweet Hattie! [sizzling] [Van Wyk]We would be so good for each other. You-you-you should tell her that. You tell her that I am not like Dirk Burger. I don't like hurting women. [intense music] [leaves rustling] Jessie! [sizzling] Did you even work out what kind of meat that is? [Van Wyk]Very lean. Too lean for kudu. [Van Wyk]It's not even a kind of buck. But it is a fresh kill. [music continues] [shrieks] I had to do a very different kind of hunting today. Thank you for the steak. But I'm afraid it's too late for Jessie. [clicks] [panting] [heavy breathing] [thud] [thud] [theme music] [music continues]
