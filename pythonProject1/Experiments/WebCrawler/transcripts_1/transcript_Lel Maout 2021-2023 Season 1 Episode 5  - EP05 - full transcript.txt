Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- EPISODE 5 Sorry I'm late. Such terrible traffic today. Everybody knows I'm always on time. -Sahar -Basil. And I am Omar, who's been watching for some time now. Amazing, you never change, since the day I met you. -Where have you been? -Come here. I never get to see you, and you never call. I was a bit busy these days. -But I missed you a lot. -God bless you. -Shall we go in? -Please. It is nice, but it seems to need a lot of work. -I can have it ready within two months. -No, I can't wait that long. I want a ready house. So, if there is a small one that is cute and warm, I have no problem. Frankly, I don't have what you're asking for, but I know someone who has such houses. -I can call him. -That would be great. Sure. -Let me help you. -Thanks. How are you, Haj? I want to ask you about the wooden house in Broumana. Is it still available? Yes, the one with a glass frontage. Great, I have a customer that wants to see it. Can you send me the keys with Abed, please? Thank you. It is available, but we have to wait for about an hour. No problem, I have nothing to do. But I do. I have to meet your brother at work. But you both can go there without me. -Will that be a problem, Sahar? -Not at all, no problem. -But I came with Omar in his car. -Don't worry! I will give you a ride. You did well, my daughter. I am so pleased with you. It would have been a mistake to do something else. You did the right thing. Believe me, this is the right thing. Is it the right thing to start a war with the person closest to me? And ignore the days we grew up together? The brotherhood, the promise. What should I do with all that? Throw it away? There is no war. She's just doing this to scare you because she is concerned about you. What if she was right? What if Hadi actually doesn't love me? Only you can answer that question. You should know whether he loves you or not. He loves me. Surely he does. But I cannot deny that he cheated on me with her. Oh, Reem. My daughter, my darling. You know how Sahar is. How strong she is. She has her own style. She knows how to find the weak point in a man to make him fall for her. It's the first time I take a step without her. I mean... I am afraid to win Hadi and lose her. I am so scared. You won't lose her, my daughter. You won't lose her. I don't want to lose her. Where have you been? You are late. I was looking for a house with Basil. -So, Basil wants to buy a house? -Yes, didn't he tell you? -The driver is late. -Sorry to have delayed your work. No, you're my work, actually. I'm used to waiting, anyway. I'm afraid I might be the one holding you up. No, I have nothing to do. Don't worry. -Do you want a cigarette? -I have a cigarillo. You didn't tell me what is it that you do. I don't do anything right now. I ended my business outside Lebanon and I came here just a few days ago. I'm thinking about working with my brother. We have a real estate agency, the one that Omar works at. This means you were introduced to Omar at your brother's agency. That agency is for my brother and me. My late father left it for both of us. But I faced some harsh circumstances and I had to leave Lebanon. How do you know Omar? By chance. I was supervising a project, and Omar wanted to rent or to buy an apartment. So, we got introduced and we became friends. Then he liked you a lot. It seems you talked a lot with Omar about me. More or less. And what else did he tell you? He told me that he tried to hit on you, and you... pushed him away. Because you disregard love, and I do understand. What is it that you understand? The story of your fiancé who committed suicide and that you are scared of love and no longer... I'm so sorry to have bothered you. Excuse me. Not at all, it is not you. It's about Omar. Not that many people know my story. I don't like telling my intimate things to just anybody. -That's why I told you that I understand. -You can't understand me. Because you have not been through what I had to suffer from. My wife also committed suicide. That's why I'm telling you. I understand you very well. I know how much you suffered and how much you still do. Especially when someone you love with all your heart is dead. You feel that everything inside you has died, and yet, you're still alive. Excuse me. Hi, brother. What's the story of the house you want to buy? I haven't found anything yet. Still looking. But why? I don't understand. It's not a big deal, brother. Should I stay with you forever? What's the problem, brother? The house is big. Is it possible for you to go and live alone? Can we postpone this conversation? Okay, I am at the construction site. Meet me there. I'm almost done. I'll finish my tour and then come to see you. All right, bye. Tell me, Abed, where are you now? Thank God you're safe. Are you okay? No, it's okay, we'll postpone this. Bye now. What happened? The driver had an accident and was hospitalized. In general, everything is good and normal. You have no problems. How long have you been trying to have a child with your husband? Frankly, we didn't try. I was on pills. -So, you need to wait a bit, Mrs. Reem. -That's why I came to you, doctor. I want to get pregnant ASAP. I mean this month. But since you are healthy, I can't give you hormones. You should try at least for six months. You may get pregnant in the first month, given that you got pregnant before. -I can't wait for six months at all. -If you are in such a hurry, we can go for an impregnation, if you want. That is out of question because my husband is against it. -Are there no other solutions? -When did you stop taking the pills? -Today. -So, we have to wait a bit for ovulation. If we stay like this, we can't deliver on time. You know there's a penalty for every day of delay. I know. The materials and customs are the reason. That's not an excuse. If we can't get a supplier to give us the iron, then we find another one. -Do you understand? -Okay. Don't bring me excuses, go and solve this. Take it easy, Hadi, there is a solution to every problem. -Thank you so much. -Why are you thanking me? For giving me a ride and for all your work. -I wish I was able to do more. -You will, when we see the house together. This is my card. Call me at your convenience to set a time for our meeting tomorrow. Can I ask you for something, if you don't mind? Of course. Like I told you, I'm a newcomer to Lebanon, and I'm homeless. I'm staying with my brother. So, maybe tomorrow you can pick me up? I'll send you the location as soon as I get there. I'll do that. Can I ask for another thing? Sure, go ahead. I don't have a car. Could you also find me a car? I want to buy one. No, sorry, I don't sell cars. So, after we see the house tomorrow, you should take me to buy a car. As you wish, Mr. Basil. And a third request. -Your requests keep coming! -Don't call me Mr. Basil. Call me Basil. Okay, Basil. -And the last request, can I? -Go ahead. -The last request. -Sure. -Don't be late tomorrow. -Is ten o'clock good enough? It's good. -Take care of yourself. -You too. There he is! Basil is here. -How are you guys? -Good, we're good. -How is work? -Very good. It's not good. -Omar? -Yes. I want you to solve this issue. I want the materials out of the harbor by next week, please. Okay, I have a connection at the port. I'll call him and see if he can fix this. -Take this, I didn't drink it. -Thank you. I'll let you know. -Don't be late. -Okay. What is the matter? It's such a mockery. Everything is delayed. What are you doing here? -I am arranging the library, as usual... -It's enough, get out of here. -There's dust on the books and I... -I don't want you to do anything. Get out. As you wish. -The door, Mona! -Yes, ma'am. She's always sitting in the library. What is it with you, Hadi? Am I a child who should stay in your house? You're not a child, Basil. Try to understand. I was so happy that you came to settle down here in Lebanon. Now you want to live by yourself. Brother, you and your wife need some privacy. And I would be more comfortable this way, so please, forget about all that. Okay, as you wish. What about work? Do you want to have a separate business? I don't know, I'm still thinking about that. There's nothing to think about. I need you. In the end, no one is more loyal to the business than us. All right, but stop nagging about the house. All right, as you wish. So, tell me, did you find anything good today? As far as the house goes, no. But maybe there's something else good. Something else? Like what? -Tell me. -The architect that showed me the house. Don't ask me what happened. I don't know. I thought that I wouldn't feel anything towards anybody after Norma. I don't know why I felt a certain feeling towards her. Maybe because she has a similar story to mine. What is her story? Her fiancé also committed suicide. Yes, babe. -Where are you, darling? -Sitting in a café with Basil. -Guess what? -What? Basil met someone, and it seems he fell for her. Yes, this is good news. -Who is she and how it happened? -I haven't finished my investigation. He's talking about it. I don't know anything yet. I will tell you when I see you. Please, come back. I also want the details. -I am waiting for you. -Okay, we will talk when I come back. Okay. -Bye. -Bye, darling. I shouldn't tell you about anything. It seems her mood has changed dramatically. Now we can see her smile. Actually, I saw her canines a while ago! Take this one. What happened? Nothing. I was dusting and arranging the books as usual. Then she came in and blew up in my face. Why? I don't know. It's as if she changed personalities. Come closer. I saw her holding a box, and it seemed she didn't want me to see it. A box? What box? -What're you thinking about, my love? -Nothing, darling. You look hungry. I brought you tomatoes. From Mr. Abdallah. You're kidding me. -It's from the land, fresh. -Enough, already. You don't want it? Okay, then. Here's a pepper. You know I don't like peppers. Yes, but you'll really like this one. Will you marry me? You went ahead and put the ring on me. -What, were you going to say no? -No. It's just that this isn't how it goes. Don't you want to go to my parents and ask for my hand, like you should? And tell them what? That I have nothing? No prospects ahead of me? That my salary lasts me for the month, and I have no house? They'll tell me to get lost. Lamees. Give me some time till the country gets better, and I can get myself sorted. But, till then... you're my wife. -I love you. -I love you more. Oh, God. I don't want to take it off. Oh, yeah, because my in-laws are so open-minded. Don't mock my family! Amine! You showered just two days ago. What's happened now? Can't I take care of myself? On the contrary. I wish you'd always be like that. -Where are you going? -Where do you think? I'm going to work. And since when you wear all these clothes, and you pour the perfume bottle on yourself? Since I got introduced to some important people. Raouf introduced me to a man from the Gulf, to be his chauffeur. People of the Gulf are good, they pay well. Sure, they do. Give me money to settle the bill of Abdallah. Sariah, it's my first day at work. When I get some money, I will give you it. Oh, God. Thank you, great lady! My darling. How are you? -My darling, God bless you. -Thank you. -I will prepare your dinner. -No, sit down, please. I can't eat. I already ate the dish you sent me. -That's good, did you like it? -Thank you, it was excellent, thanks. Did Master Abdallah like it? He almost devoured his fingers with the food! He also took what was left for his dinner. Hanane, please help me! Abu Mahmoud is going to die, Hanane! -Please do something -What are you doing? -I want to try something, Auntie. -Abu Mahmoud, oh, God! Let's massage him, he's tense. Lift his legs up. -Did you try the rose water? -I tried everything. Abu Mahmoud. -Please God. I'll put this on. -What are you doing? This is not working. Breathe! He is going to die! -Abu Mahmoud! -I am massaging him. Please do something, please. I beg you, leave this device and call the ambulance. Okay, come on. Come on, Abu Mahmoud. Answer us, Abu Mahmoud! What am I going to tell you about her? I just met her, I don't anything about her. Tell us about the way she looks, for example. Is she pretty? She should be pretty in his eye. What is the matter with you? Stop doing this. What is it with you? Do you know who will be happy to hear about this? -Mom. Did you tell her? -What am I going to tell her? There's nothing to tell her. What is it with you, Hadi? You're treating me like I'm a little kid. You're bothering me, man. Enough of that! Enough! What happened to him? He's exaggerating. We were just kidding. -Actually, his condition is causing that. -His condition? What's wrong with him? Don't worry, he'll be okay in five minutes. I think you should go out and check on him. Maybe you can calm him down a bit. I'll fix this, don't worry. Forgive me, Basil. Maybe I was exaggerating. -Maybe? -Not maybe. For sure. But I'm really happy for you. I haven't seen you happy in a long time. And this is how you express your happiness? Okay. I apologize to you, I am sorry. Let it go, Basil. Be strong! We're going to the hospital, darling. -What's wrong? What happened? -I don't know, the machine is broken. Mom, what's wrong with Dad? The machine broke, and he couldn't breathe. -Help me climb. -Shall we go? I'm his son, I want to come with you. Take the van and some money. Maybe they don't have any. And follow them quickly. God willing, he will be back in good health and we will celebrate it. -Thank you. -May God heal him, I pray. -I wish him well. -Yes, thank you. Oh, God. I swear it, Um Mahmoud broke my heart. I should have been with her now. Don't worry. God willing, he'll be back and in good health I gave Rasheed some money and told him to go after them. In case they need anything. -There is no God but Allah. -God bless you. God bless you. All your life, you've been so generous and self-sacrificing. People must stand with each other, Hanane. We belong together. God bless you. Excuse me. -Let me give you a ride. -It's okay, my house is nearby. Goodnight. -Welcome, Mr. Raouf. -You're welcome, ma'am. -I brought you a treat! -Welcome, both of you. Welcome. -What a macho guy you bring with you! -Amine is an old friend. Welcome, welcome. It seems your friend is bold. He went right to the center. Yvonne. -And you can call me Yvo! -I prefer to call you "great lady." Raouf, it seems your friend is well-spoken. My tongue runs smoothly when I see such beauty. Your smooth talking is very obvious. Tell me... Are you an amateur or a professional player? It depends on the kind of game. Let's start first with poker. I can impress you, lady. Amine is a first-class player. Very good. In that case, you shall sit at the first-class table. Halim, darling, you're an old player and I can ask you to do this for me. Go and pick any girl, for free. Get up. -You're the best, Mrs. Yvonne. -Go ahead. Sit down, please, you're welcome. Girls, take care of these gentlemen. -Sousou. -What is it? Let Abdo and Salim take care of them and play with them and let them win. I want them to entice this one, and you should take care of the macho guy. At your service. Welcome, handsome man. -What would you like to have, Mr... -Amine, simply. I will prepare for you the best glass of whiskey. You're welcome. This is an appetizer! -What is this, Raouf? -Didn't I tell you? You win. -It seems you are a good poker player. -I don't know, Raouf. Amine is not only good at the game, but with women also. -"Women," plural? -Yes. -Who would believe this? -Sousou would, and Nado too. Go now, don't be shy. Come on. Welcome. Our night is a straight flush! Yvonne doesn't allow anyone to monopolize us. She is afraid that we might fall in love. That's why we are forbidden from staying with the same client. -But you are different. -What do you mean, different? Are you telling her what is happening between us? Relax, darling, relax. What is happening between us? -You understand me very well. -I got it, naughty boy. You mean what is not happening between us. What happens between these walls stays within these walls. Don't be afraid. I am not afraid. I don't get scared. I am a man, the son of a man. I'm an alpha. But it's the damned woman that made me like that. Okay, calm down. Was she your wife? Did you divorce her? What happened to you? -She loved another man. -What a terrible woman! Get it off your chest. Make me your confidante. Actually, he is the terrible person. He is the bad one. I introduced him to her and he stole her from me. But she fell for him because he is handsome and rich. Why would you die for her? You are handsome and many girls wish to be with you. Except her. You're still in love with her. Love her? I adore her. Do you see her? -Yes, I see them when they are together. -Honestly, this is too much. Too much. Too much? "Too much," doesn't say it all. When I see them together, something rips me apart from the inside. It hurts. I want to kill them both. And I accept the fact that she is the wife of my friend. Funnily, when they fight, I bring them back together. Aren't you tired of working? Yes, I am. Today, I went to the doctor. Frankly, I wanted to ask you about this subject, but I didn't know how to start the conversation. I don't want you to misunderstand me. I know. Reem, explain the situation for me. I mean, is there hope or... no hope at all? Basically, there's no hope. What did the doctors tell you? They all have the same answer. But today, I went to a new doctor. They told me he is very good. Medically, they're all saying the same thing. -But do you know what he told me? -What? One of his patients had the same case. And he tried everything, to no avail. And all of a sudden, she wasn't taking anything, and she got pregnant. Nobody knows how. Don't worry. What God has written for you will happen. I swear it. It will happen. My heart is telling me it will happen. God willing. Mahmoud, come darling. Tell me how is your dad now? He is better, thank God. He is getting out of the hospital today. I am going to fix this bottle. Do you need money? You did more than enough yesterday. Thank you. Are you talking to me like that, Mahmoud? Your father is like a brother to me. My son, tell me now if you need money. -I managed to get enough, believe me. -Okay, send him my greetings. -Bye, now. -Bye. Mahmoud. My son, if you need money and don't tell me, I won't forgive you. Believe me, if I need money, I'll only come to you. -Promise? -Promise. -Say hello to your father. -See you soon. May God be with you, Mahmoud, my darling. -Good morning, Abdallah. -Welcome, Amine. Welcome. How are you, Mahmoud? Mom. -Mom -What? I'm going to school, and I don't have money. Have you seen your father anywhere? -No. Didn't he sleep here? -No, he didn't, and his phone is off. It's all right, Mom, maybe he has a customer. I want some money. Take some from my purse, it's on the table. There's no money here, Mom There are some cereals. -What are these? -Leave them. -Where is the money? -There's no money. He did it, the bastard! -Good morning -Not a good morning, you thief! Where is the money that was in this purse? Calm down, what is it with you? Take this. And I settled the debt with Abdallah. Happy now? -Hey, you, where... -Mom, I need money to go to school. Take this. It's 50,000. Take only 10,000 for the whole week, and I need the 40,000 back. -No excuses. -Okay. -How did you get this? -I already told you. I'm working with the man from the Gulf. -Did you forget? -No, I didn't. Come closer. Why do you smell like an ashtray? You stink. -Just let me be -I will. I couldn't care less. If you don't know the way to your resources, then your resources will find a way to you. It might be fixable, it might not be. They won't know until they take it apart, but if they fix it, it'll cost you more than its original price. I advise you to buy a new one. What is the price of the new one? Frankly, I don't have one in the pharmacy, but I'll call a friend who knows, and he can inform me. Please. Thank you. How much is the calcium? Forty-five thousand. I beg you, please give me some money. I want to buy milk for Sayyed. He hasn't eaten since yesterday. -Where is your mother? -My mother is dead. -And who lives with you? -I live alone with my brother. -Alone? -Yes. -Where is your father? -He left when I was little. -Where did he leave? -I don't know! He left a long time ago. I beg you, may God bless you with a long life, and may he keep your beautiful green eyes! Give me some money. May God keep your husband and kids. Give me money. Come with me. I want to take you to buy milk. No, give me money and I will go. -No, you come with me. -Enough, I don't want anything from you. You wasted my time, cheapskate! I spit on you! Damn you, damn your parents, and damn your family! Okay, Wissam, thank you. Bye, now. Sir, they don't have this model anymore. But the newest one, it's more advanced. It runs only on electricity. So, if you're outside the house, you can't use it. No problem, my father doesn't get out of the house. All right. Can I ask you to do me another favor? Can he send us some photos of the new machine? Sure. Wissam, can you please send me some photos of the device? -How much is it? -It's 4,800,000 -That much? -You know the situation with the dollar. Buying it now is better than buying tomorrow. What is the price of an old device like this one? Around 1,700,000 or 1,800,000, but they told me you can't find one like this because it's so old. Okay, let me think about it. Thank you, anyway. Hey, you, hey, parking guy! Hey, parking guy! Park my car somewhere close, not far away from here. My friends are waiting for me at the restaurant. It's a birthday, okay? Don't park it far away, bye. Hey, take it easy! Why are you blowing your horn like that? It's my friend's birthday, another social duty! You have no manners and no morals. Basil. Aren't you going to wish me a good morning before you go? So, what about this enthusiasm? Where are you going? There's no enthusiasm. I'm just going to see the house. Ah, the house. Is it the house or the one helping you to buy it? Okay, don't get upset, I was kidding. Both of them! I am waiting for her to come and pick me up. Great, and you made sure to look handsome today. Believe me, I missed all this a lot. I know, I know. That's why I want you to go for it, don't be afraid. I am not afraid, but I am surprised about my reaction. I feel... I haven't experienced this feeling for a long time. I thought there was no hope. It turns out that there is hope. But believe me, this is the right time. This is the right time to forget the past. And to look after your life and your future. Don't look back again. There she is, on her way to us. -Get inside. -No, I want to meet her. -I'll introduce her to you later. Just go. -Please. Go, man.
