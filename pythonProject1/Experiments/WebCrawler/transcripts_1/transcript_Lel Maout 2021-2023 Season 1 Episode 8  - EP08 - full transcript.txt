Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- A rose for the pretty lady next to you. Please. My sweetie. If you're waiting for people to come forward and give you money, then you'll get nothing. Money won't come to you. You have to go chasing it. I'm Omar. Wejdan. EPISODE 8 What are you doing here? How long will you keep running away from me? I love you, Wejdan. I'm deeply in love with you. -I'm deeply in love with you. -Have you lost your mind? Someone will notice! Leave me, Omar. Let me go now. I don't care if someone notices. I came here to tell the truth about Sahar in front of you. I want you to see that I introduced Basil to Sahar. She's not in love with him as she tried to convince Hanane. That's all because you're at war. It's all part of the game that I'm bored playing because I love you. -Let go of me. -I love you. Let go of me! Get out of my life! Get out! Wait. You can't just love me or leave me whenever you like. We agreed that it was the last game we'd play on Hadi and afterwards, you'd leave him and marry me. Listen, you're mine. -No, I'm not yours. Our story is over. -No, it's not over. Look. That's the ring you chose. It was your dream to marry me and wear it. Let go of me, Omar, you're hurting me. Let go of me. What are you? Do you think you're not hurting me? Tomorrow, be at my place at 11:00. Otherwise, I'll be unstoppable. Is the meal delicious or do I have an appetite? The meal is delicious, and you have an appetite. Do you think so? For sure, and the reason is crystal clear. You see? His words. His heart knows better. Cheers to this lovely gathering and to this mutual friendship. You're people that I'll never abandon, whatever the price. Cheers. -Cheers, my love. -Cheers. Cheers, my friend. Thank you, that's nice of you. I'll go out to smoke, my love. Of course it should be done. It's already done. Yes, but I wasn't happy there. I didn't feel okay. However, the atmosphere was nice -So, are you happy? -Very. What is Omar telling you? -He's only telling me nice things. -As usual. Reem told me you have some delicious red wine in the basement. Indeed, my pleasure. Don't be late, okay? Omar, don't let her follow me, and you'll be rewarded later. Thank you for the lovely gathering. Stay here. Let go of me. Stay here, or all hell will break loose, okay? I can't wait for you to come to my place tomorrow. You're an animal! I knew that it was a small world, but not that much. Why are you silent? What do you want me to say? Speak your mind. When we were in Turkey, you asked me if I believed in coincidence. And your answer was no. -And now? -Again, I say no. Do you think I'm following you? I don't know. You should tell me. Yes, I'm following you. Where are you going? Where are you going, Sahar? -We still didn't talk. -No, our conversation is over. You heard what you needed to hear. Don't you want me to say that? I've said it. Sahar, can you explain to me what a coincidence this is? I can't believe it. What can't you believe, Hadi? Where do I know you from? Where do I know what type of work you do? Your family? Your brother? What are you trying to tell me? You're right, you're right. But I'm confused, and I don't know what to do. I'll tell you what to do. Go on with your life as usual. Tomorrow, I'll put an end to my relationship with Basil. You won't see my face again. What's up? We can't smoke in the villa? We were smoking, and we lost track of time talking. What were you talking about? Thank you, Basil, for the nice evening. You're really the nicest guy I've ever met. What can I do? This is my nature. I can't rest assured unless I drop you home and close the door after you. No, I don't like this. Anyways, have a good night. Why is that? I feel like spending the evening with you. -It's still early. -I know that. It's not even midnight. You know what I meant. It's still early. I don't like rushing. Yes, you're right. Good night. Good night, Basil. So, what's your opinion about Sahar? I don't know. -What do you mean? -We still don't know her very well. But she seems nice, doesn't she? Nice. Don't you miss me? Yes, my love. I missed you. I have a few emails I have to reply to. Don't you dare think of not coming. You hear me well, Reem? Like I told you, I'm waiting for you. You have one hour to arrive. Otherwise, you know what might happen. What's your name? Khouloud. Why are you crying? I had 15,500. Those bastards took it from me, and they beat me. Why are you laughing? -Because you're a liar. -Stop it! I don't lie! Okay, I'll stop. What if I give you 100,000, and you'll tell me who's your boss? You're the liar, not me. Indeed. Liars understand each other. Wait! Come here. -What do you want? -What's your name? Why do you want to know? I've told you my name, no? My name is Wejdan. You have a nice name. Can you give me 5,000? Eight, nine, ten. -Sariah, this labneh is expired... -Damn this day! Did you have to talk right now? You put me off! You've been counting for two hours. You should have finished by now. I'm happy. It's the first time that I've seen this much money. Yes, and you'll see much more. Amine, is all this money from the guy from the Gulf that you're driving around? He's a real lifesaver. He has much more, and he'll give me more money. Then, don't touch this money. I want to change the house furniture. I also want to tear off this old wallpaper that's been here since my mother was alive. The whole house needs changing, anyway. Is it worth paying to get it fixed when we'll be moving somewhere else? By the way, I've met Jaber, and he proposed to buy it. Listen, Amine, I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I won't sell this house. It has all my childhood memories. Are your childhood memories worth more than 500 million? What are you saying? He's certainly an idiot to propose such an amount. We'll be the idiots if we don't accept such an offer. There's surely something wrong. This house isn't worth 500 million. The whole neighborhood isn't worth 500 million. If Jaber hasn't got double or triple what he's offering, he wouldn't make that offer. I'm sure that he's studied this offer very well. Whether he studied his offer well or not, what's important is that we capitalize on the situation and take our money from the hyena's mouth. My money, pal. My money. This is my house, and I'll decide whether I sell it or not. You'd be an idiot if you refused such an offer. I'll think about it. Usually, one wouldn't think twice about such a matter. I need to think about it ten times, not just twice, because something's suspicious. -Sariah, listen to me... -Habib, eat some pickles. Fill your mouth and let me think. -Good morning, Mr. Hadi. -Stay on the line. -Is Reem back? -Not yet. -Where's Basil? -In the garden. Your coffee is ready. -Where do I park it? -No worries, we'll do it for you. No, man, I'll park it, just tell me where. I told you we'll do it, so come on. Well, you've become really rich, Jaber. Now, you can be a snob. I want things to go as planned, do you understand? I don't want you to commit any mistake, otherwise you'll ruin the whole project. -Well, well, well. -I'll call you back. You've become someone, Jaber. Who can be compared to you? You. And you can be like me. Me? How? In my dreams. No, in reality, if you cooperate with me. In fact, Mr. Jaber... I'm at your service. I'll do whatever you want. Perfect. Take this cigar. It's Cuban, the best. It's been rolled on women's thighs. It even has the smell of women. -It smells like cigarettes. -You're poor and you'll never change. -You should smoke rolled cigarettes. -Okay, no worries. It smells like women. I told you, you're poor. Take this. Taste this wine. Is it also made on women's thighs? This is made with women's feet. They throw the grapes on the floor, and they stamp on them with their feet. Those women, whatever they do, the result is nice. -Yes, but not all women. -Certainly not all women. If my wife Sariah was stepping on them, we'd have gotten vinegar. Talking about your wife Sariah, won't she sell me the house and put an end to it? She'll sell, believe me. -And Abdallah? -He too. Offer your money, and even the sultan's daughter will marry you. My money is ready. Here you go. When you convince a new seller, you'll get the same amount. When I demolish the neighborhood and rebuild it again, you'll get a brand-new apartment. I prefer to have cash money. Didn't I say that you're poor? Mate, I like holding money in my hand and smelling it, exactly how you love to smell the cigars. Okay. Take this pack and smell it. Great! The nice smell of dollars. Perfect! It's the second time I've called her, but no reply. I've called her twice. I don't know. Last night, when I dropped her home, I felt something strange. She's not okay. I shouldn't have introduced her to you. I'm the one to blame. She's afraid of any engagement. Calm down, Basil. Calm down. I don't want to calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. I've called her twice, and no reply. Maybe she's sleeping. -Is it possible that she's sleeping? -Yes, it's possible, it's 10:30. Give me the phone and sit down. Yes, she's probably still sleeping. That's why she didn't answer. Your mum called me. She called you yesterday and you didn't answer. When do I call her? Now, if you want. -And if she doesn't answer? -Why wouldn't she answer? Didn't you say she's sleeping? She's sleeping, how will she answer? Sahar is probably sleeping. Your mother would be awake. Go and call your mother. -It's you? -No. Your mother. Who were you expecting? Your sweetheart, Wejdan? -What do you want, Sahar? -Come on, pretend you're an idiot. "What do you want?" Don't you know what I want? Why were you dining there yesterday? Why expose us in front of Reem and then turn on me? I didn't turn on you at all, but I don't want to continue this game. I've had enough, and I don't want it anymore. I'll lose Wejdan. I'm going to lose her. I was about to get her back to you, idiot. Why did you introduce me to Basil? Wasn't it so I got closer to Hadi and showed her he doesn't love her? You should've waited. I'd have brought her back to you like a dog. No, I can't wait longer. She's getting more attached to him every day. She's falling in love with him more and more. I can't... Idiot! You're an idiot. And what can I do if you're such an idiot? You're ruining everything... I don't care what happens! I don't care! I don't want money anymore. I don't want money. I want Wejdan back. I want to go back to normal. I can't imagine the world without her. Just imagine, she's even stealing... my manhood. She's stealing my manhood from me. Manhood has nothing to do with the bedroom. Manhood is in controlling the situation, man. So, you have feelings towards, Basil? I can't believe you have feelings. Listen, my little one... we agreed that in love and war, all is permitted. You're my sister and my sweetheart, but business is business. If you think that I've believed your crocodile tears, then you're mistaken. If you saw me standing by you a bit, then don't believe it. I was acting as well. I knew from the start that you meeting Basil wasn't a coincidence. Moreover, you got Hanane in the game. What do you want from that woman? You're such a liar, and you only think about yourself. Ultimately, we've both played this game, so you can come to my house. To my playground, smart one. Let's see who will win this war. Omar? Coming. Coming, coming. What do you want to leave me alone, you and her? How much? I'm ready to pay you everything we've earned since we started working together, but just leave me alone! -I love how you get mad! I just love that! -Don't touch me, you animal! Tell me what you want. Do you cherish Hadi to the point that you'll abandon your life's work? Yes, I cherish him a lot indeed! What do you call our relationship, then? What is it for you? What is that cheap? What was between us is over! Why can't you understand? What was between us is over, Omar. It's over! Over? Yes. Why don't you understand me? How do you want me to make it clear? I've lived a lie my whole life because of you. A lie which you wanted me to believe. And that is that no one but you can love me. A lie that you and Sahar planted in my head my whole life. But then, Hadi arrived. Do you know what he made me believe? He made me believe that Reem is lovable. Reem can build the family she dreamed of her whole life. The respectful family girl Reem, whose parents died during the war. Yes, she's lovable, I won't lie to you. But Wejdan, the one that Hanane found and took to the orphanage, the one she escaped from, who started begging and stealing... and sold her body to a million men... I doubt she could be loved. There's only one man who loves Wejdan, and that's Omar. Do you know why? I'll tell you why. Because he's the only one who knows her truth. He's the only one who knows everything about her. He's the only one who knows her truth and who loves her. -Wejdan belongs to Omar only. -Let go of me! -Wejdan belongs to Omar only. -I want to go! -You're mine! -Let go, you animal! -Stop! -Get off, you animal! Let go of me! Let go of me, you animal! I'm not an animal! -Omar! -Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Hello? Sahar, why aren't answering my calls? Did I bother you with something? Not at all, but I'm not feeling well, and I don't know what to tell you. You're right. You're totally right, and maybe we rushed things a bit. Quite honestly, yes. We're both taking things a bit fast and this is frightening me. As you wish, we'll take things easy, no problem. No, Basil, no. I don't want to hurt you or myself. You and I went through some hard times. We can't have our hearts broken again. But I won't break your heart, Sahar. But I may break your heart. Basil, I'm not fit to be yours. You deserve someone better. I'm not feeling okay. I can't talk any longer. I have to end the call. You didn't get ready? -What's wrong? -She left me, Hadi. She left me. She left me. It's my fault, not hers. The problem is in me, not in her. Go to that man over there. Chat with him and get him excited. -Is all going well, boys? -Thanks to you, madam. Not really, madam. Don't believe it that much. Don't worry, things will get better. My dear, talk to me. What's the deal? When will you draw a smile on your face? I've told you more than a hundred times tonight to smile. What do you mean? Like that? You're being mean, you insolent thing! Stay here! You entertain the clients! I'll open the door. Welcome! Welcome, my prince! -How are you? -I'm fine. How are you, Fifi? Perfect. I thought you wouldn't come again. Why is that? After what happened last time. You think that your story is the only one that's painful and sad? Your husband makes you work. The whole world has worked on me. The whole world. Your story is nothing compared to mine. It's nothing. Why? What do you mean? What's the story behind this ring's owner? We were raised together. We played together when we were little. We ate together, we drank together. We loved each other since we were little. So, how did you meet her? On the streets. I used to clean car windows, and she used to sell chewing gum. But she used to make more money. Do you know why? -Because she is beautiful. -Stop it. Is this a joke? Stop kidding so late at night. Why are you surprised? Do you feel that I'm a street boy? No. Honestly, you look like a rich family boy. A rich one. This is... what we call the stealing equipment. Do you have parents? I used to have parents. I used to. I lost my father when I was ten years old. He left me with a sick mum and a younger sister. I grew up... very early. I grew up quickly after that. When I was ten years old... I was asked to be a man. I experienced a lot, believe me. A lot. Life was really harsh on me, and then it spit on me. What happened to her? She... She is the only good thing in my life. If you loved each other since your childhood, why did she marry your friend? I really don't understand. No, he's not my friend. He's not my friend at all. I made him my friend so we could fool him like we did many others before him. The plan for her to marry him and then for us to rip him off for half of his money. It was supposed to be the last game. After that, she would divorce him and come back to me. But she loved him, the bastard! She loved him. She fell in love with him. She fell in love with him. Answer! Please, answer! My love? Reem? You went back to sleeping here. No, but I woke up early... I came to sit here, but it seems I fell asleep again. Come. Come closer! I forgot to tell you. I was thinking... about inviting Sahar to dinner tonight to please Basil. Do you mind? I think she'll mind, because they split up. -Why? -I don't know why. I saw him yesterday and he was upset. He didn't give me any details. I'll take a shower and check on Basil. I'll ask him to explain. Good morning, my little one. So, Sahar, why did you and Basil split up? Tell me what you're planning. What do you care if we split up or not? I care a lot. Our war hasn't ended yet. Why did you stop playing? Were you scared? Yes, I got really scared. I'm shaking. Who said I've stopped? Mona? Mona? -Yes, madam? -Tell Sariah to come up here. Why do I have to go up? What does she want from me? What? I don't know, Sariah. I don't know. Quickly. If it were for a meal, she would have told you. -Don't be slow. -There's something bad. Listen, I don't feel good about it either. I'm afraid she suspects we're checking her things while she's gone. My God! -I don't need an argument with Mrs. Reem. -It won't be an argument! -God help us! -Do you think she'll fire me? Hopefully not. I don't think so. You don't think so because you're at peace. You have Mr. Hadi by your side. I'm the miserable one here. Keep an eye on the rice! Did you ask for me, Mrs. Reem? Come in, Sariah. Close the door and sit down. Sit down. -No, thank you, I prefer to stand up. -Sit down, Sariah. Sit down. Tell me, madam. How long have you been working here? Next week, it'll be four months, Mrs. Reem. In these four months, do you know how much I've come to trust you? Trust me? Yes, trust you. You're so kind, madam. Mona has been working here for years, and Mr. Hadi trusts her blindly. -But I trust only you. -I'm really ashamed now, Mrs. Reem. I don't know what to say. I'll do anything for you, and your words are an honor. Listen, Sariah... I can know a person as soon as I look them in the eye. Many people recommended you, and I've chosen you from many. You know that. Since you came to my house, I knew I could trust you. -Your husband works as a driver, right? -Right. I'm sure he's trustworthy, just like you are. Amine is really trustworthy, Mrs. Reem. His name suits him. "Trustworthy." Perfect! Then, I want him to work for me. I'll give him 2,000 dollars per month. Two thousand dollars? Mrs. Reem, I can't find my words. Amine would like to have such a job, for sure. When do you want him to start? -As of tomorrow. -Okay, then. And if he proves to be trustworthy like you are, you'll both be happy. I hope God helps us to compensate you, Mrs. Reem. There's a proverb I'd like to tell you, and it's a relevant proverb. "If you don't find your way to your livelihood, your livelihood will find its way to you." You're that way, Mrs. Reem. Bassouli. Bassouli. Bassouli. Bassouli. Wake up, Bassouli. Bassouli. Bassouli. Basil. Basil! Basil! Basil! Basil! Basil! Basil!
