Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- Yes? Good morning. I had a late night, so I figured I'd just.. I mean... Give me a minute, will you? Yes. - So what is it? - Tuesday. - Funny. - A body. Maybe drowned, maybe not. Austrian side. Are we ready? Yes. Good morning. And? That fisherman over there found her in his net. He panicked and couldn't pull her on board. So he sailed to shore like this. - With the body dragging behind? - What else could he do? And then the net with the body, also got entangled with a buoy. Hey, Zeiler. Zeiler. Inspector? - Are you Ok? - Yes. She has strangulation marks on her neck. Maybe from the net. - Yes, they're clearly antemortem. - The welts? Yes, she was still alive at the time. - You mean someone strangled her? - It may have been the net, and her panic. She went for a night swim. She undressed back there Completely naked? - Do you have a name yet? - We have a key, but no car. She probably came on foot. That means she didn't live far. Zeiler. Hey! Zeiler, what was that all about at the lake? - The salvage reminded me of something. - Of what? The accident with your parents? It's more a feeling. It doesn't feel good, OK? Look over there. A motor... Well, here we are. I hate delivering death notices. I can do it. No, please. This is the police. - Yard, around the back. Yes. Niermeyer. Shit. Hey. Hello. What are you doing here? Oh, shit. Don't worry. You don't need to be afraid. What's your name? I'll say. Zeiler! Come on, everything's fine. What are you doing? I want to go home. We'll take you home. What's your name? - Noemi. I'll notify her parents. She's done so before? I understand. OK. No, she's fine. Are you thirsty? Don't worry, Mrs. Rademann, I have a daughter myself. You only have beer on board. - One second. It's a camper van, not a school bus. Excuse me. No, we won't make it complicated. We'll bring Noemi home. Yes, right away. All right, until then. What is it? - Sleepwalking across such a distance? Yes, sure. She only lives a mile away, on the Austrian side. Her mother says she's done so before. The girl knows the area. She knows the house and the dead woman. Yes, from school. The victim was her teacher. A school on the Austrian side. I have to give it to you, chasing a man into the woods and coming back with a child. - At least I found something. I know what our trespasser looks like. - Are you sure? - Maybe someone from the school. He wanted to delete it. What other reason could there be? - It wasn't trespassing. He had a key. Then why did he run? Thank God. - What were you doing, sweetheart? - I don't know. Did you wake up without knowing where you were? It's getting worse and worse. I close everything at night. You didn't call the police? Not this time. You can't always explain the sleepwalking. They just think we're bad parents. We looked for you everywhere. Come. Next station, bathtub. We need to have a word with her. Once she calms down. What for? We're investigating a murder. In the area where we found her. - Good day. - Oh, fuck! Why so jumpy? Thanks. - Did you come for the 600? - I came to say hello. We already saw each other today. At the lake and at the victim's house. Excuse me? Your old 600 has a cracked cylinder. It's very noisy. I see. Yes, I was driving around to look for Noemi. Why at the lake? When she takes off like that, she always goes down to the lake. It's always fifty-fifty, right or left. But you didn't find Noemi. We did. So you're from the police? - You rode around for nothing. Are you investigating that murder? What makes you say it was murder? You called the fire department, so the boys called their girlfriends. At that point everyone knows I mean, it's a village. Doesn't mean it's murder. Your colleague called my sister. And you guys investigate murders, right? It could be an incident or third-party negligence. Did you know Julia Niermeyer? Just from sight, yes. I'd disinfect that. That's my brother, Mike. He moved in with us after a motorcycle accident. It's not easy for him without a regular job. The clothing. Misconception. Nothing important. - Ready? - Yes. Rademann is a software developer. He works from home. I'd like to work from home. Always being with the family. Start by sleeping at home instead of in your van. Thanks for the tip. - And? Mike Schiffl? - He repairs and sells. - He's the girl's uncle. - He's odd. Look who's talking. She had sex, a few hours before her death. Voluntarily, it seems. Semen, but no injuries. And' the hematomas are not from the net. Sorry, I was wrong there. The rope is too thin. The welts would've been narrower. But this is from a rope, right? - Correct. - But she hardly had water in her lungs. - She was dead already. She was strangled. Unequivocally murder. - Why so many welts? - The murderer must've enjoyed it What do you mean? - He strangled her with a rope Long enough to produce such welts. It took some effort. - So he watched her die? - And stopped intermittently. - Until she came to again. - And then he started again? One, two, three, four, five times It was a prolonged death struggle. He relished it. She didn't defend herself? Her hands were tied Duct tape, around 1.5" wide. Good. Good. Niermeyer didn't have any family, only a sister abroad. And the dog. He's an orphan now. Where did he suddenly come from? Through the door. He was at the lakeside barking, said the fisherman. The neighbors say she often had male visitors. - Visitors? Plural? - So what? She was single. I'll check who they were. - Where did the victim's clothes go? - Forensics has them. OK. - Why? - What's this? - What does it look like? It was in the bedroom. And there were traces on the bedposts. - Bondage games? - We'll have to see if it was a game. - They didn't find any other underwear? - No, that's all. - We should've noticed at first. - What? Not a single crease. It hasn't been worn, Komlatschek. True, recently washed. And ironed. How did it end up lakeside? Nude swimming I can understand, but walking all the way to the lake naked? No. Someone's screwing with us. - Exactly. What do we do with the dog? - Didn't your daughter always want one? No. - And you? - I'm allergic. Yes? Mom, look, I'm getting a dog. - One second. Hey, sweetheart. Thanks, Daddy. You're welcome. Yes, I'm back. - You're not serious, are you? - One second. I'll explain it. Yes? What, five times? You don't just do that. It takes practice. A murderer learns every time: The duct tape points to a certain routine. Yes, we have to review all open case files. And we have to talk to the girl. I informed the parents. You can do that. - I don't think so. - No, Noemi clearly took a liking to you. - She doesn't remember anything. She still may have seen something. As you should know. Hello? Zeiler? Charming. Mommy! Daddy! Dr. Lena Golding Child and Youth Psychologist This is the office of doctor... Nice of you to visit. I tried calling, but you didn't answer. We'd only continue arguing. You see, I was right. You didn't want to see me, so I slept in the van again - You come and go as you please. - That's my job, Kim. And as if that wasn't enough, you bring a dog home? It's only temporary. You don't get it, do you? That dog ties me to home, not you. - You're leaving again anyway. - Don't get worked up. Don't you think I'd like to get out sometimes? Mommy, the dog pooped on the lawn. And you have to go again, right? Niermeyer was well-liked. Komlatschek says she's worked here for 16 years. Not a student in sight. - Last day of school trip. Local tradition. - We had a party last night. - You and Julia Niermeyer? No, all the teachers and the staff. As always at the end of the year. Did you have sex with Julia Niermeyer? Yes or no? What makes you say that? Me? No. It was a party, we were fooling around. My God. We can verify it with a DNA test. OK, she came on to me. She was like that. I was very tipsy. And yes, afterwards we went to her place. It was a one-time slip. I wouldn't want to risk my marriage. That's why you went to her house this morning, to destroy evidence. I wanted to talk to her, but no one was there. I thought she was walking her dog. You knew where her spare key was? Working together for so many years, you learn a lot about your colleagues. I'm sure it's the same with you. You're a fast runner. Why did you take off? I just heard 'police, and basically I was trespassing. Correct. That's one reason we're here. But I didn't kill her. You have to believe me. We'll take a DNA sample, then we'll see. Yes? I'd love to know who he's talking to. He was at a murder victim's house and took off. Enough to suspect him. The police came to see me. - Do they know you were at her house? - I couldn't deny it. - So we'll get busted. I threw them off with a story. Our agreement stands, OK? All right, thanks. Hey, kiddo. Shall we go fora test drive? What's the matter? You always want to go. - Come on. - I don't want to, today. Come here, I'll tell you a secret. I have a bag full of gummy bears. Come. Hey! - She's scared of you. - Don't talk nonsense. It was your fault she spent the night outside. That scared her. Komlatschek. Niermeyer's lovers. Turns out to be a limited bunch after all. None of them knew about the others but they all came by regularly. - Anyone suspicious? - No. Their alibis match their GPS positions. We can rule them out. OK. Your wife called. She asked if you forgot about your daughter. Pick Luna up from riding school. Shit What did you tell her? - That you went to the riding school. - Thanks. You see, Komlatschek can teach you things. - Like what? Lying? Where are you going? You go to the riding school, I go to the lake. The night unit knows the Rademanns. They've looked for the little sleepwalker before. Ok. - Yes, Oberlander, homicide. - Police? - Dr. Lena Golding, You called me. - Yes. No. In which case? You tell me, I'm a child psychologist. Yes, OK, I understand. No, that was my colleague. Mrs. Golding, we need your advice, or your assistance. It concerns the questioning of a little girl. 552010. Is that the number? Look, now it appears on your screen. Good job, sweetie. She has her mother's eyes. - Did you have fun? - I can't bring the dog again. You know he's only visiting us. You heard Mom. - Why? The dog can protect me. - Protect you? That little mutt? From what? When you're both not there at night. What? Was Mommy not there? When? Last night? OK. Come. - Are you listening? - Yes, I understand. Someone watched Julia Niermeyer's house and perhaps saw the murder. Or committed it. Someone used the platform. Mike Schiffl, I think. Let's go to the lab and find out. - I'll go. Thanks. And the cross check? A colleague’s 'I think so' won't do. - I can do a cross check too. - Two things, No unexplained bodies in the lake that fit the pattern. No naked, strangled or fishing net. Too bad. - Depends on how you look at it. -And the phone-records you wanted. From the teacher. Principal. The principal didn't yield very much. But at the time in question he was talking to a certain Josef Fehling. - And he's much more interesting. - Because? He talked to Julia Niermeyer on the phone 14 times this week. And the calls stopped a day before her death. I know Fehling. He's my daughter's riding instructor. That makes sense. What makes sense? A call from Fehling around 9:00 pm last night. Who did he call? Kim Oberlander. - All right, let's question him. - Now? Isn't it a little late? Consideration, from your side? You're usually never that sensitive. Can't you sleep? Tomorrow those two officers are coming - Are you worried? - A little. You don't need to be. I'm with you. Now sleep. - Good night. - Good night, Daddy. Of course I know her. She's my son's teacher. We suspect murder, Mr. Fehling. Yes, Principal Warnel has informed all parents. Why did you talk to Mrs. Niermeyer on the phone so often? 14 times in three days My son is doing badly at school. His grades weren't sufficient to pass. - Is that all? - It would've been the second time. He'd have been expelled. I had to prevent that. Were you able to persuade her? Well, you're going to find out anyway. - You can count on that. I begged and beseeched Niermeyer. I even offered her money. And? - And nothing. Warnel took the money. - For better grades? - Of course. The kid passes but will transfer to another school. So there'll be no questions. But it turned out not to be that easy for the principal, right? The class teacher had some documents at home. - And Warnel was going to get them? - He did, but you surprised him. - End of story. - If you say so. Come. Were you here last night as well? The entire evening? I was inside the house. - Can anyone verify that? Your wife, perhaps? No, Mr. Oberlander. My wife died in childbirth. I am and was alone, last night as well. He's lying. People lie with an alibi, not without one. We'll definitely grill him again. If you want to know if Fehling is sleeping with your wife, ask Kim. Josef, please don't call me. It was a mistake. I don't want it. That's OK. I just want to tell you your husband came to see me. He knows. I'm really sorry. Don't bother. Good morning. - You haven't changed since yesterday. - Let's go, we have an appointment. Not that I know of. - I wasn't sure you'd show up. You and I discussed how important this is. You can't do anything wrong, Noemi. We'll play and talk a little, OK? - Let's draw something. I don't feel like it. It would be good if you did. Hannah. Hello. What is this? What? The therapist was your idea. Hello, Dr. Golding. Oberlander, Homicide. This is my colleague, Ms. Zeiler. Thank you for coming. Have a seat. Maybe it's good for her to talk to a therapist. Why? Until recently Noemi was a bedwetter. Then she started sleepwalking. It's getting worse and worse. The school doctor said we should do this but my wife thinks it'll resolve itself. That way I can concentrate better. First I imagine something nice. Then, I try to remember what it is I've forgotten. Usually, I remember again very quickly. Let's close our eyes and then you tell me the last thing you recall from that night. Nothing at all. You remember you woke up Outside, right? Yes... In the forest. That man was there. Yes, that was in the morning. Did you sleep all that time? Go on and close your eyes, Noemi. I don't want to. - It only makes her afraid. - Opposition isn't helpful, Ms. Zeiler. Mrs. Golding only wants to help you. Noemi. If you ask me, it's better if you stay. I didn't ask you. Zeiler. I'm sorry, she'll apologize to you. Hannah Zeiler from Vienna. She's changed a lot. But then again, she hasn't. Zeiler? Zeiler! Hey! Is she in her right mind? You consider my colleague normal? After what happened just now? Wow. That disqualifies you somewhat, Doctor. What is Zeiler afraid of? You know about patient confidentiality, right? I know she has memory issues. We all know. Her parents' accident on the lake, the storm. Mother dead, father disappeared. The storm? - Yes, the reason the boat capsized. It was because of a storm, wasn't it? Ok. I think I know where Zeiler took Noemi - Are you afraid? - I'm not afraid of you. I was afraid. That I would forget even more. That I couldn't hold onto it. Was it here? Is that where you were hiding? - Why didn't you go home when you woke up? - I don't remember. I found that smells helped me. Oil from the boat, the water. The stench of algae. You crossed this forest. OK Smell this. Do you think Mom and Dad are mad I left again? You left with me, it'll be fine. Wait by the motorcycle, OK? I'll take you home in a second. - I'm listening. - Well... That your therapist sends me after you says enough, doesn't it? - She's not my therapist. Did you think about the girl? - About what Noemi is going through? - Noemi isn't telling the truth. What? Come on. I won't open it again until this is settled. We won't question, Noemi again. We'll be lucky if her parents don't slam us with a complaint. All right, I'm listening. I lost my parents. And the memory of how. I see. And that occasionally makes it hard for you? And at the lake? The body? Was your mother's body recovered like that? I don't know, I don't remember. Like with Noemi No, she's not afraid to forget, because she hasn't forgotten anything She doesn't want to talk? - Exactly. Did she say why? Of course not, she doesn't talk. You've seen the parents, she isn't neglected She must have another reason. I can't imagine it's just her decision. She's only ten. She's protecting someone, or at least she's promised to. -Are you two up to something again? Excuse me? You had your riding school, Ms. Zeiler, the Rademanns... and I can iron everything out on the phone again. My pleasure, by the way. Do you have the cross check? I hope you didn't hit anyone. 'Baking chocolate cake.' That's more something for Mom. - Go to sleep now, it's late already. - Good night. Can you be nice to Uncle Mike again? Think of our picnic on the weekend. We need him to make it nice again. OK. If there is anything, you call us, OK? Good night. You can't lock her up like some animal. Is that why you left the front door open last night? Nonsense. That was an oversight. I'm sorry. It's just that I'm so worried. What are we doing wrong? Micha, you scared me. - I didn't know you were here. - And I didn't know you were coming back. - You've been sneaking off at night lately. - I was walking the dog. Come on, you know exactly what I mean. And whom. At least don't treat me like an idiot. Micha, I'm sorry. - If I could, I'd... - Listen, Kim. I know we're not doing well right now. And Fehling... He's an attractive guy, beyond a doubt. - What are you saying? - Things can backfire. Can we not talk about those rumors, but just about us? We have a problem. Hold on. What rumors? - Isn't that what you mean by backfiring? - I meant I'll bash the guy's face in, Kim. So, what rumors? About that suicide. Stallmeister's sister who hanged herself in his barn a few years ago. Because of a broken heart, after Josef supposedly rejected her. But that's irrelevant now. Hanged herself? - Death by strangulation. - What? That's everything, but irrelevant. I'll never see him again. It won't happen a second time. - Do you know what her name was? - No. Talk to me. Say something, anything. Stay I away from him Are you angry? No. Buddha The bike came back in one piece. Does your new friend ride well? Her name is Hannah. But I don't believe she's my friend. Like we always do. And talked. Here, maybe this. Focus. Why are you looking at slides? - Because they're better photos. Analog, not digital. - I was at the riding school two years ago. - Fehling's place? Komlatschek took 212 photos that day so we have a wide selection. A selection for what purpose? To prove the death of Gabriele Tiefenbacher two years ago on August 12 wasn't suicide. - You see that? - Yes. The same hematomas as Julia Niermeyer's. - They're probably remorse marks -What? She tries to kill herself, runs out of air, adrenaline rush.. - Survival instinct gets triggered. - Yes, and? She tried to save herself in the end. Remorse marks. Even if it doesn't suit you. So it's a coincidence? We visit Fehling in the murder case of Julia Niermeyer... - and find a dead woman on his lot? - In the past. With an investigation file. Which determines suicide. - You took 212 photos? Just like that? - I had my doubts. Why are we talking about this only after Mr. Oberlander decides to go after Fehling? We looked-for dead bodies in the water. This was ticked off as suicide. With doubts. I understand. Careful, please. - Why did you have doubts? - She wasn't wearing underwear. - There. - That's very suspicious, of course. Yes, it sure is. Our current victim's underwear is also gone. And Dr. Neber was a pretty hefty boozer before his retirement. Here, stamp and signature. Shaky, right? He was probably always hammered. The 'boozer' had Parkinson's. That's the only reason he quit. He went on to teach at the university. Good, then we can still question him. He died six months ago. - Then we'll exhume the victim. - Or just forget it. She was cremated. - Josef Fehling knew both women. - It was suicide. One worked for him, the other was his son's teacher. He's an obvious suspect. Why not? It's not a matter of just wanting it. Be objective. Object... Speaking of objectivity, what does the blood test say? The cigarette butt and the blood on the cloth? Same DNA, Positive. Yes, and all you have is a platform. Nothing else. - What did Hannah want to know? What I saw. At the teacher's house, and so on. And did you see anything? I know what you did. But I can keep it a secret. Because it's important, right? Yes, it's important. Very important. Do you think they'll be back? Dad told them not to. He doesn't like them. Neither do I. Here you are. Breakfast is ready Want to join us? - Great resolution. Nice work. - Yes, analog, not digital. What can you tell us? It's possible the woman caused those marks herself during her death struggle. Or it was the same murderer. The same desire in killing. Yes, that's also possible. But I tend to agree with Dr. Neber. He was a luminary in his profession. The next of kin were all investigated. You'll find nothing new. Nor from Fehling himself. All right, fine. It sounds fine to me. - I fear the worst. You're not here for the spark plugs. I don't believe you. Well, I don't believe you either. You said you hardly knew the victim. Julia Niermeyer, the teacher. My brother-in-law warned me about you. I'd rather not talk to you. The platform, Mr. Schiffl. You left so many traces, it looks like a second home. - I observe migratory birds. - You observed Julia Niermeyer. - How are you going to prove that? - We could start with you telling me. I'll have to order the spark plugs. If you really fear the worst for them. I meant I fear the worst for you. You collect all school magazines and yearbooks. Are there better ways to document school classes? - What can I do for you? - Tell me the truth, for example But the whole truth this time. So, Josef Fehling. Believe me, I won't ask again. Oh God, Fehling. All right, good. I made it possible for his son to pass the grade. But Julia still had the minutes of the teachers' meeting, and I took them. - It was a favor. - It was a business deal. - I've known Josef for years. - From where? We were in the hospital together. I had a slipped disk, he had a riding accident. Two years ago, during summer vacation. Summer vacation two years ago? So also on August 12 two years ago? Excuse me. - Yes? - He's holding back. Who, Mike Schiffl? Really, even with your charms? What about your suspect, Josef Fehling? I'm afraid we can rule him out. Alibi, hospital stay. If it's true. -All those slides and still suicide - I'm glad it makes you happy. I'll see you at the station. - Did you mean Mike Schiffl? - Yes. Schiffl is a sly old dog. He was a Peeping Tom. He drilled a hole in the girls' dressing room. He was caught and beaten up. He defended himself and fought back. Charges were filed, and he was sentenced to community service. It was a big thing at the school. Juvenile detention. He served his sentence. - So I was right. - No, I said he 'was' a Peeping Tom. It's an inclination, not a hobby. It's a sickness, it can get worse. Yes, maybe you're right. How did you put it again? 'He's odd.' You wanted to see-me? About what? About something serious. Relatively serious, given the circumstances. Relax. What are you talking about? The teacher. The dead one. What did you do? I only watched her every now and then. She often had visitors. What? Niermeyer often had visitors. She'd have sex and I'd photograph her. You did what? So it wasn't an adolescent thing? You still do that? Peter, I swear, I didn't do anything. But the police think I did. That inspector thinks I'm the murderer. But I didn't hurt anyone. I.. You have to believe me, all I did was take pictures. All I did was take pictures. I believe you. Mike, everything will be fine. I've supported you long enough. It's time you return the favor. Peter? I'm coming, dear. Peter. Did you talk to Mike? He's not here. I don't know what he wanted. Did you expect this? Investigation pressure, hopelessness. Spontaneous decision. It definitely wasn't an easy death. That looks like a fetish. Probably the women's underwear. Julia Niermeyer. If you ask me, there's a connection to that hanging in Fehling's stable. Oberlander was right It was murder. Straightforward evidence. Like a farewell present. Worth as much as a confession. What's that? Why burn one piece of evidence and give us another? I think we should take some more photos. Go ahead and cry. It's only right. It's OK. You promised if I didn't tell anyone, everything would be fine again. I know. But you saw what Uncle Mike did when you woke up that night. - Noemi. - I didn't see Uncle Mike. What did I tell you? I only saw you... and the teacher. She was naked. - You put her in a wheelbarrow. Because I wanted to help Uncle Mike. That's why I took her to the lake. It was Uncle Mike, you know that. Right? Noemi. You shouldn't have run away when you saw me at the teacher's house. That made it all complicated. Now you have to help. No one must know. It has to remain our secret forever. OK? Come. Come here. Melanie Rademann found her brother. She says she didn't touch anything. Mike Schiffl destroys all his photos, but not the hard evidence? Correct. That means he confesses to the murders, but doesn't want to be seen as a pervert. - It looks that way. - Please, that stinks to high heaven. All right, let's assume you're right and the girl is flying. Maybe not for Uncle Mike. - For her parents? - Yes. They were very upset when you rode off with he Maybe not out of fear for their daughter. - But out of fear of losing control. - To not have influence over her. Dangerous if Noemi carries a secret. The question remains what she's seen. The murder of her teacher? What do you think? Would a child keep that secret to protect her family? The man who knows the family best and could've answered is dead. Yes. But your therapist, she has a good eye for the family. - She's not my therapist. - Yes... But I can still ask her. Good. By way of exception. Why are we meeting here? - You recognized the place, didn't you? - Mike Schiffl is dead. But we don't think it was suicide. Noemi's protecting her parents. We want to know why. You told my colleague her parents have problems. What do you know about the Rademanns? They're not aware of their influence on the child. Other than that, only what I picked up the other day. Melanie and Peter have been together since high school. "It wasn't a romantic start. I'll never forget that." What do you mean? That's what Melanie Rademann said, off the cuff. I didn't follow up on it. I was there for the daughter, not for the parents. That dead woman in the lake. She evokes images in me. Memories. Not many, but... Try to change something minor. That dissolves blockages. Hannah, something minor. Just change something minor. Good... but I think that's enough. Uncle Mike didn't like chocolate much. We always ate gummy bears. But that was our secret. - I knew about that secret. What? That's not a bad thing. You can tell me. I'm your mother, you can tell me everything. Even if Daddy's forbidden me? Daddy forbade you? Yes, when I woke up. At Mrs, Niermeyer's house. In the night. OK, now we have to wait. Come. Kim doesn't want him in the house and I don't want him in the van. So he's going to a home. - What are we doing here? The Rademanns, together since high school And something they can't forget Just follow me. If Mike Schiffl went to this school so did his sister. I'll take the dog. Sorry? - That's something minor, isn't it? - Are you serious? - Yes. And another point! Come on. - Peter Rademann is 35. - One might call this trespassing. Yes, sure. But the principal won't lodge a complaint. I suggest we start backwards, starting from graduation. Couple of the Year Here. Melanie and Peter Rademann, couple of the year. Rademann must've been the school stud. And she the ugly duckling. Not my call. It says so right here. At least four pages of student t comments, Mostly spiteful. All wondering why they're together. A death notice. "We'll miss you." What on earth are you doing here? Was it really an accident back then? What? Go to your room. Go to your room. That was during a school climbing trip. Awful accident. A student got strangled. Peter and Melanie were witnesses? - Yes. Was that-trip also at the end of the year? Tradition? And after the vacation they were a couple. - It wasn't your fault. I told everyone so. Why? Because it's the truth. - Because I love you, Peter. - Yes, so? It was an accident, wasn't it? That can't be. And afterwards? Any more? The body in the lake? Also? Peter. The door. You were gone during the night. That's why the door wasn't locked. You were at Niermeyer's, right? Did you have an affair? With her? No way. Tell me the truth. Do you love me? You were always loyal. You still are. My God. That was the deal. Climbing accident or not, Rademann tasted blood that day.
