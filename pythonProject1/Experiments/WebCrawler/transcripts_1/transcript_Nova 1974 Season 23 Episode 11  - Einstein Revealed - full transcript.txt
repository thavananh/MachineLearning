Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- WE NOW RETURN TO "EINSTEIN REVEALED." HE BECAME THE FIRST SCIENTIST CELEBRITY OF THE 20th CENTURY BUT ALBERT EINSTEIN WAS NO STRANGER TO HARD WORK AND HEARTBREAK. THE CONCLUSION OF "EINSTEIN REVEALED." NOVA IS FUNDED BY PRUDENTIAL. LIVING WELL ISN'T ABOUT BEING RICH. IT'S ABOUT FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE AND TAKING CONTROL OF YOUR FUTURE. SO MAKE A PLAN. AND BY MERCK. MERCK... PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH. DEDICATED TO PREVENTING DISEASE. ALL I HAVE TRIED TO DO IN MY LIFE IS ASK A FEW QUESTIONS. COULD GOD HAVE CREATED THE UNIVERSE ANY OTHER WAY OR HAD HE NO CHOICE? AND HOW WOULD I HAVE MADE THE UNIVERSE IF I HAD THE CHANCE? Abraham: IT WAS ALBERT EINSTEIN'S ASTOUNDING ALMOST ARROGANT AMBITION, TO READ THE MIND OF GOD. AND HE SUCCEEDED, TIME AND AGAIN COMPLETELY TRANSFORMING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SPACE, TIME, AND LIGHT. BUT AS HIS NEWLY PUBLISHED PAPERS REVEAL THERE WAS A PRICE THAT HE, AND THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM HAD TO PAY FOR EACH AND EVERY TRIUMPH. Einstein: I HAVE LEARNED TO ISOLATE MYSELF FROM THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF HUMAN RELATIONS. LIFE TENDS TO GET CLOGGED UP, ESPECIALLY MARRIAGE. Abraham: THAT CONFLICT BETWEEN SCIENCE AND HUMAN RELATIONS PLAYED OUT ACROSS ALL OF EINSTEIN'S ADULT LIFE. IN 1905, HE AND HIS WIFE MILEVA WERE LIVING A QUIET LIFE IN BERN WITH THEIR INFANT SON. EVEN AFTER THE PUBLICATION OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND THE OTHER DISCOVERIES OF HIS MIRACLE YEAR EINSTEIN REMAINED AN EXAMINER AT THE SWISS PATENT OFFICE. Einstein: "JANUARY 1907. "DEAR FRIEND, I AM STILL A FEDERAL INK PISSER "WITH A DECENT SALARY. "I WORK EVERY DAY EIGHT HOURS AT THE PATENT OFFICE "AND AT LEAST ONE HOUR OF PRIVATE LESSONS YET I ENJOY IT HERE, AND THERE IS MUCH THINKING TO BE DONE." Abraham: BUT IN SCIENCE, EINSTEIN WAS NO LONGER AN OUTSIDER. A GROWING NUMBER OF PHYSICISTS MADE THE PILGRIMAGE TO THE PATENT OFFICE. THEY WOULD TREK UP TO THE TOP FLOOR AND ASK A SMARTLY DRESSED YOUNG MAN TO LEAD THEM TO DR. EINSTEIN. EINSTEIN LATER TOLD A FRIEND THAT HE HAD NEVER MET A REAL PHYSICIST BEFORE. HIS FRIEND RESPONDED, "DIDN'T YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR?" BUT EVEN AS HIS REPUTATION GREW, EINSTEIN BEGAN TO GRASP THE LIMITATIONS OF HIS SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY. IN 1907, EINSTEIN WAS ASKED TO SUMMARIZE EVERYTHING THEN KNOWN ABOUT SPECIAL RELATIVITY FOR A LEADING PHYSICS JOURNAL. HE SAW THAT HIS THEORY ENCOMPASSED ALL OF PHYSICS EXCEPT FOR ONE CRUCIAL GAP. HE SAID TO HIMSELF "NOW I MUST SEE IF I CAN FIT INTO THAT FRAMEWORK ALL PHENOMENA ONE CAN THINK OF." AND EVERYTHING COULD BE FITTED... MECHANICS AS IT WAS KNOWN THE THEORY OF MAXWELL AS IT WAS KNOWN THE ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY... BUT ONE THING HE COULDN'T FIT IN AND THAT WAS GRAVITATION. Abraham: GRAVITY SEEMED STRAIGHTFORWARD ENOUGH. A POUND OF PORK, A POUND OF CHERRIES OR OF ANYTHING WILL MOVE THE SCALES THE SAME AMOUNT BECAUSE THE EARTH'S GRAVITY PULLS ON THEM ALL IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. YET WHAT THE EARTH DOES TO MAKE ITSELF FELT BY MEAT, POTATOES AND US... THAT NO ONE KNEW. ISAAC NEWTON HAD SHOWN THAT GRAVITY GOVERNS THE MOTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM AS WELL BUT EVEN NEWTON'S THEORY COULD NOT EXPLAIN HOW GRAVITY EXERTS ITS INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE UNIVERSE. THAT WAS THE MYSTERY OF GRAVITY: HOW IS IT THAT THE HEAVENS STAY ON TRACK? WHAT IS IT THAT ORDERS THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE? EINSTEIN, STILL IN HIS 20s WAS CHASING THE BIGGEST GAME IN PHYSICS... A TREMENDOUS GAMBLE AS THE GREAT MAX PLANCK TRIED TO TELL HIM. MAX PLANCK WARNED ME NOT TO WORK ON THE THEORY OF GRAVITY. THE PROBLEM WAS TOO DIFFICULT, HE SAID, AND EVEN IF I SUCCEEDED NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE ME. BUT I TOOK IT ON ANYWAY AND NEVER WORKED SO HARD IN ALL MY LIFE. THE FIRST THEORY OF RELATIVITY WAS CHILD'S PLAY COMPARED TO THE PROBLEM OF GRAVITATION. Abraham: GRAVITY IS THE MOST DEMOCRATIC PHENOMENON IN THE UNIVERSE. IT TREATS EVERY OBJECT THE SAME NO MATTER WHAT IT IS MADE OF, NO MATTER HOW BIG IT IS. THERE WERE NO EXCEPTIONS TO GIVE EINSTEIN A PLACE TO START. HE HAD NO IDEA HOW TO APPROACH THE PROBLEM, UNTIL... THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT OCCURRED TO ME. DER GLUCKLICHSTE GEDANKE MEINES LEBENS: THE HAPPIEST THOUGHT OF MY LIFE. IF A MAN FALLS FROM THE ROOF OF A HOUSE HE WILL NOT FEEL HIS OWN WEIGHT. Abraham: IN ANOTHER OF HIS THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS EINSTEIN PUT THE IDEA THIS WAY. WHAT IF SOMEONE WERE IN AN ELEVATOR WHEN THE CABLE SNAPPED? HE WOULD FLOAT, WEIGHTLESS AS HE AND THE ELEVATOR BOTH FREE-FALL AT THE SAME RATE IN THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD. THEN EINSTEIN CHANGED THE SCENE: WHAT IF THE PASSENGER WERE IN A ROCKET SHIP FAR FROM EARTH? HE WOULD STILL FLOAT WITH NO GRAVITATIONAL FIELD TO HOLD HIS FEET TO THE FLOOR. BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ROCKET BEGAN TO MOVE? AS IT ACCELERATES, THE FLOOR OF THE ROCKET RISES. ON ITS WAY UP, IT WOULD CATCH THE PASSENGER AND TO HIM, IT WOULD SEEM THAT GRAVITY WAS HOLDING HIS FEET TO THE FLOOR. AND IF GRAVITY AND ACCELERATION FEEL THE SAME PERHAPS THEY ARE THE SAME, AND THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCELERATING IN OUTER SPACE OR STANDING IN THE EARTH'S GRAVITATIONAL FIELD WAITING FOR THE ELEVATOR DOOR TO OPEN. THIS WAS CLASSIC EINSTEIN. HIS CONTEMPORARIES FOUND THIS EQUIVALENCE OF ACCELERATION AND GRAVITY INTERESTING. BUT ONLY HE REALIZED THAT IT COULD SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT WOULD BECOME A REVOLUTIONARY NEW THEORY OF GRAVITY. Man: IF I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF ASKING EINSTEIN ONE QUESTION I WOULD ASK HIM HOW HE COULD BE SO SURE OF THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH HE BUILT HIS THEORIES. HOW COULD HE BE SO SURE THAT THE DEAR LORD REQUIRED THAT THE RELATIVITY POSTULATE BE SATISFIED THROUGHOUT NATURE? HOW COULD HE BE SO SURE THAT THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE REALLY HELD EVERYWHERE AND AT ALL TIMES? AND IF HE COULD TELL US HOW HE DID THAT THAT WOULD BE... THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING. Abraham: WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT HE DID IT WITH FEROCIOUS CONCENTRATION TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL ELSE. WHICH MEANT THAT OVER TIME HE GAVE LESS AND LESS ATTENTION HIS WIFE MILEVA. WHEN THEY COURTED HE HAD PROMISED THAT THEY WOULD BE SCIENTIFIC PARTNERS... TWO AGAINST THE WORLD. BUT EINSTEIN'S PRIORITIES HAD CHANGED. Einstein: I AM NOT MUCH GOOD WITH PEOPLE AND I AM NOT A FAMILY MAN. I WANT MY PEACE. I FEEL THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND IT MAKES ME HAPPY. Abraham: RELATIONS BETWEEN EINSTEIN AND HIS WIFE GREW WORSE WHEN THEY MOVED TO PRAGUE IN 1911. EINSTEIN HAD BEEN NAMED A FULL PROFESSOR AT THE GERMAN UNIVERSITY THERE... A MAJOR STEP UP THE PROFESSIONAL LADDER. BUT FOR MILEVA, CLOISTERED IN THEIR APARTMENT AND WITH A SECOND SON TO CARE FOR, PRAGUE FELT LIKE EXILE. Schulmann: MILEVA FELT SHE WAS BEING MARGINALIZED EVER MORE PUSHED TO THE SIDE, LESS AND LESS IMPORTANT. WHEN THE DIVISION OF LABOR BETWEEN EINSTEIN AND MILEVA WAS THAT HE DO THE SCIENTIFIC WORK AND SHE BE EXPECTED TO DO THE DOMESTIC SIDE OF THINGS I THINK THE PRETENSE THEY HAD TRIED TO MAINTAIN OVER THE YEARS FELL APART COMPLETELY. JUST THINK OF IT... SHE HAD FAILED IN HER AMBITIONS. WHEN I SAY AMBITIONS, I DON'T MEAN AMBITIOUS OF GETTING POWER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT BECOMING A NEW KIND OF WOMAN AMONG... IN A WORLD OF MEN. THIS HAD COMPLETELY FAILED. Abraham: RECENTLY DISCOVERED LETTERS REVEAL AN UNEASY MIX OF PRIDE, FEAR AND A HINT OF JEALOUSY. Mileva: "I AM VERY HAPPY ABOUT HIS SUCCESS "WHICH HE HAS REALLY EARNED. "I ONLY HOPE AND WISH THAT FAME DOES NOT EXERT A DETRIMENTAL INFLUENCE ON HIS HUMAN SIDE." Abraham: BEHIND THE WALLS OF THEIR HOME MILEVA'S DEPRESSION AND BITTERNESS GREW. Mileva: "NOT MUCH TIME REMAINS FOR HIS WIFE. "I OFTEN ASK MYSELF WHETHER I AM NOT A PERSON "WHO FEELS A GREAT DEAL AND SUFFERS BECAUSE OF THAT. "I AM STARVED FOR LOVE AND I ALMOST BELIEVE WICKED SCIENCE IS GUILTY." Einstein: WHEN I THINK SERIOUSLY DAY AND NIGHT I CANNOT EASILY ENGAGE IN LOVING CHATTER IN THE SAME WAY ONE CAN'T PLAY THE VIOLIN IF HE HAS JUST BEEN WORKING WITH A LARGE HAMMER. Abraham: THERE COULD BE NO COMPROMISE... SCIENCE WOULD ALWAYS COME FIRST ESPECIALLY THE PROBLEM OF GRAVITATION. EINSTEIN NOW ASKED IF ACCELERATION AND GRAVITY ARE EQUIVALENT WHAT HAPPENS WHILE ACCELERATING THAT REVEALS SOMETHING NEW ABOUT GRAVITY? BACK TO HIS ROCKET SHIP EINSTEIN RESUMED HIS THOUGHT EXPERIMENT. AS THE ROCKET ACCELERATES A RAY OF LIGHT SHINING THROUGH THE WINDOW HITS THE OTHER SIDE AT A LOWER POINT THAN IT ENTERED. TO A PASSENGER, THE LIGHT APPEARS TO CURVE. IF ACCELERATION CAN BEND LIGHT THEN BY THE EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE GRAVITY MUST DO THE SAME. IT SEEMED A CRUCIAL CLUE... BUT WHERE WOULD IT LEAD? GRAVITY DOES MORE THAN MAKE THINGS FALL... THAT MUCH WAS CLEAR... BUT I STILL HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS. MY OFFICE IN PRAGUE LOOKED OUT OVER AN ASYLUM AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I FELT A CERTAIN KINSHIP WITH THE INMATES. THEY WERE THE MADMEN WHO DID NOT CONCERN THEMSELVES WITH PHYSICS I WAS THE MADMAN WHO DID. Abraham: THE ASYLUM IS STILL THERE WALLS, BARS, INMATES AND ALL. FOR HIS PART, EINSTEIN WAS ONLY HALF-JOKING. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS GRAVITY BECAME ALMOST HIS SOLE OBSESSION. IN 1911, THE FIRST SOLVAY CONFERENCE IN BRUSSELS BROUGHT TOGETHER EUROPE'S MOST FAMOUS PHYSICISTS. IT WAS AN INVITATION-ONLY AFFAIR. EINSTEIN WAS THE YOUNGEST TO ATTEND. GABRIELLE OPPENHEIM'S FATHER WAS RECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BRUSSELS. SHE IS NOW 103 BUT SHE WAS 19 WHEN EINSTEIN CAME TO CALL. WHEN WE HAD BIG SOIREE BECAUSE MY FATHER AND MOTHER INVITED MANY PEOPLE AND THEY WERE ALL, THAT DAY, THEY WERE ALL PHYSICISTS BECAUSE THERE WAS A CONGRESS OF PHYSICS AND MY HUSBAND SAID "THAT GENTLEMAN"... HE POINTED HIM OUT... WILL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THOSE PHYSICISTS." Abraham: THE FORMER PATENT CLERK NOW TRADED IDEAS WITH THE LIKES OF MADAME CURIE WITH THE GREAT DUTCH PHYSICIST, HENDRIK LORENTZ AND THE ENGLISH ATOMIC SCIENTIST, ERNEST RUTHERFORD. EVEN IN SUCH COMPANY EINSTEIN WAS RECOGNIZED AS FIRST AMONG EQUALS. Oppenheim: MY HUSBAND SAID, "THAT GENTLEMAN HE... WILL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST." SO I GAVE HIM ONE SANDWICH MORE. AND IT... IT'S TRUE. Abraham: THERE WAS ONE PERSON WHO MISSED EINSTEIN'S TRIUMPH: MILEVA. Mileva: IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY INTERESTING. I WOULD HAVE LOVED ONLY TOO WELL TO HAVE LISTENED A LITTLE AND TO HAVE SEEN ALL THOSE FINE PEOPLE. IT'S BEEN AN ETERNITY SINCE WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER. WILL YOU STILL RECOGNIZE ME? Abraham: WHAT EINSTEIN WANTED IN MARRIAGE WAS DOMESTIC COMFORT NOT AN INTELLECTUAL PARTNER. Einstein: "OCTOBER 1911, EN ROUTE. "MY DEAR LITTLE WIFE... "AROUND 1:00 IN THE MORNING I FOUND THE HAM "AND IMMEDIATELY POLISHED IT OFF. "THE APPLES ALSO DID AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF GOOD "IN THIS FRIGHTFUL STEAM BATH. MANY KISSES TO YOU AND THE CHILDREN." Abraham: AS THE MONTHS PASSED, MILEVA'S ISOLATION DEEPENED BUT THE WORST SHOCK WAS STILL TO COME. ON A VISIT TO GERMANY, EINSTEIN MET A COUSIN, ELSA EINSTEIN WHO CAME FROM A TOWN AND BACKGROUND SIMILAR TO HIS OWN. EINSTEIN SAW IN ELSA A CHANCE FOR A DOMESTIC LIFE FREE OF DEMANDS AND CONFLICT. Schulmann: HE HAD IN ELSA A LINK TO THIS PLACE. SHE SHARED A LOT OF THE TRAITS THAT ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE IDENTIFIED WITH VERY STRONGLY: A CERTAIN KIND OF UNAFFECTED PLEASURE IN THE SIMPLE THINGS IN LIFE AND ENJOYMENT OF FOOD AND DRINK AND I THINK THAT SHE REPRESENTED THAT FOR HIM WHEREVER HE WENT AND THAT SENSE OF PLACE THAT SHE REPRESENTED WENT WITH HIM. Abraham: MILEVA HAD LITTLE CHANCE AGAINST ELSA'S UNCOMPLICATED APPEAL. THE TWO COUSINS BEGAN A CORRESPONDENCE THAT REVEALS THEIR GROWING BOND. Einstein: "DEAR ELSA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LETTER. "THERE IS NO BOOK ON RELATIVITY COMPREHENSIBLE TO LAYMEN "BUT WHAT DO YOU HAVE A COUSIN FOR? "IF YOU EVER HAPPEN TO BE IN ZURICH "THEN WE... WITHOUT MY WIFE, WHO IS UNFORTUNATELY VERY JEALOUS... "WILL TAKE A NICE WALK, AND I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THOSE CURIOUS THINGS I HAVE DISCOVERED." "DEAR ELSA, BOTH OF US ARE POOR DEVILS "EACH SHACKLED TO OUR UNRELENTING DUTIES "BUT I MUST TELL YOU ONCE AGAIN, I LOVE YOU. "I WOULD BE SO HAPPY TO WALK JUST A FEW STEPS AT YOUR SIDE. I SUFFER BECAUSE I LOVE ONE AT WHOM I CAN ONLY LOOK." Abraham: THAT WAS IT FOR A TIME. IN 1912, EINSTEIN BROKE WITH ELSA AND MOVED TO ZURICH TO TEACH AT THE E.T.H., THE FEDERAL POLYTECHNIC WHERE HE AND MILEVA HAD STUDIED. EINSTEIN HAD BEEN AN UNDISTINGUISHED STUDENT. NOW HE WAS COMING BACK AS A FULL PROFESSOR OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS. HERE HE EMBARKED ON THE MOST INTENSE EFFORT OF HIS LIFE RENEWING HIS ATTACK ON THE GRAVITY PROBLEM. HE STARTED WITH AN IDEA FROM A FORMER TEACHER, HERMANN MINKOWSKI WHO HAD DOUBTS ABOUT HIS TROUBLESOME PUPIL UNTIL HE READ EINSTEIN'S 1905 PAPER ON SPECIAL RELATIVITY. AFTER EINSTEIN HAD CREATED THE THEORY OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY IT HAPPENED THAT HIS OLD MATH TEACHER... WHOSE LECTURES HE'D SKIPPED... LOOKED AT EINSTEIN'S PAPERS, AND SAID "WELL, I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT HE WAS CAPABLE OF THIS. THIS IS REALLY GOOD." MINKOWSKI CALLED ME A LAZY DOG, AND PERHAPS HE WAS RIGHT BUT RELATIVITY SEEMED TO IMPRESS HIM. I WOULD HAVE FELT SOME SENSE OF TRIUMPH ONLY THEN HE TRANSLATED IT INTO MATHEMATICAL TERMS WHEREUPON EVEN I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND MY THEORY. Abraham: EINSTEIN MAY NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT BUT TO MINKOWSKI, IT WAS CLEAR: SPACE AND TIME ARE FUSED TOGETHER INTO A SINGLE, FOUR-DIMENSIONAL PICTURE OF THE WORLD. THINK OF A VAST ARENA... A VAST ARENA WHERE FOUR NUMBERS CAN RECORD THE UNIQUE LOCATION OF ANY EVENT. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH JUST THREE NUMBERS WE CAN LOCATE ANY OBJECT IN THE UNIVERSE FROM THE TIP OF YOUR NOSE TO THE FARTHEST GALAXY. THREE NUMBERS... LENGTH, WIDTH AND HEIGHTH... ALLOW US TO RECORD THE POSITION OF ALL OBJECTS. NOW ADD TIME. WITH THIS FOURTH DIMENSION WE'RE ABLE TO RECORD ANY EVENT IN THE UNIVERSE FROM THE EXPLOSION OF A STAR TO A HOT SATURDAY NIGHT DATE. Abraham: HERE IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON SPACE-TIME EXPERIENCES: MEETING A FRIEND ON A SUMMER DAY. THIS MEETING TAKES PLACE AT A PARTICULAR LOCATION: THE INTERSECTION OF THE TWO PATHS AND, ONE HOPES, AT 10:10. AS MINKOWSKI RECOGNIZED, EVERY EVENT FORMS A UNIQUE MATHEMATICAL PICTURE IN SPACE-TIME. HERE, AS THE SECONDS PASS THE MAN STAYS IN ONE PLACE IN SPACE... BUT MOVES CONTINUOUSLY THROUGH THE TIME DIMENSION UNTIL... HIS DATE ARRIVES. AS THE IDEA OF SPACE-TIME SUNK IN EINSTEIN REALIZED HE COULD GO ONE STEP BEYOND. HE HAD THIS WONDERFUL PIECE OF WORK WHICH MINKOWSKI HAD DONE IN TRANSFORMING HIS OWN WORK INTO THE IDEA OF A FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACE-TIME. BUT THEN EINSTEIN HIT ON THE IDEA THAT THIS WASN'T A RIGID STRAIGHT SPACE-TIME. IT MUST BE CURVED AND IT MUST HAVE VARIATIONS OF CURVATURE WITHIN IT. Abraham: THAT WAS PERHAPS EINSTEIN'S MOST INSPIRED LEAP OF LOGIC. WHAT IF THE SHAPE OF SPACE AND TIME COULD WARP AND CURVE? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN? GRAVITY HAPPENS. EINSTEIN'S BRILLIANT IDEA... THE IDEA THAT MAKES THE WHOLE THING WORK... WAS THE FACT THAT IT IS MATTER MATTER AND ENERGY WHICH DRIVES THE BENDING OF SPACE AND TIME. THROW A ROCK INTO A POND, FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN YOU THROW A ROCK INTO A POND, RIPPLES START TO FORM. IT IS THE ROCK WHICH CREATES THE RIPPLES ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND. THEREFORE, THE PRESENCE OF A ROCK CREATES RIPPLES IN SPACE AND TIME THAT WE CALL GRAVITY. Abraham: SPACE-TIME WITHOUT MATTER IS FLAT BUT ADD A ROCK OR A STAR AND THE WHOLE PICTURE CHANGES. THE ENORMOUS MASS OF THE STAR CREATES A HUGE DENT. ANYTHING THAT PASSES CLOSE ENOUGH WILL ROLL DOWN AND AROUND THAT WARP IN SPACE-TIME. THE STRAIGHTEST PATH THROUGH THE CURVES IN SPACE-TIME CREATED BY MATTER AND ENERGY. IT WAS THIS PICTURE THAT SHOWED EINSTEIN HOW GRAVITY HOLDS THE EARTH IN ORBIT. THE EARTH SIMPLY FOLLOWS THE WARP IN SPACE-TIME CREATED BY THE SUN. EINSTEIN PUBLISHED AN EARLY VERSION OF HIS NEW THEORY OF GRAVITY IN 1913. THERE WERE STILL PIECES MISSING BUT HE IMPRESSED THE ONE AUDIENCE THAT MATTERED. IN THAT YEAR, MAX PLANCK, GERMANY'S LEADING PHYSICIST MADE THE PILGRIMAGE TO ZURICH WITH A COLLEAGUE TO OFFER EINSTEIN A JOB IN BERLIN. PLANCK AND NERNST LOOKED ME OVER AS IF I WERE A PRIZE HEN BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IF I COULD LAY ANOTHER EGG. I TOLD THEM I NEEDED TO THINK ABOUT IT AND WOULD MEET THEM AT THE STATION THE NEXT DAY. IF MY ANSWER WAS NO, I WOULD WEAR A WHITE FLOWER IN MY LAPEL BUT IF THE FLOWER WAS RED, THEN BERLIN IT WOULD BE. Abraham: IT WAS THE CLIMAX OF A CAREER: BERLIN WAS THE WORLD'S LEADING CENTER FOR THEORETICAL PHYSICS. WITHOUT DOUBT, THE FORMER PATENT CLERK HAD ARRIVED. BUT FOR MILEVA, THE PROMISE OF BERLIN HELD NO ATTRACTION. THE MARRIAGE LAY IN SHAMBLES. THE INTENSE CONCENTRATION ON GRAVITY HAD ERODED ALL THAT REMAINED OF A FAMILY LIFE. Einstein: IN MY CIRCUMSTANCES, I TURN TOWARDS SCIENCE WHICH RAISES ME UP FROM THE VALLEY OF TEARS INTO THE QUIET ATMOSPHERE... IMPERSONAL, WITHOUT SWEARING AND YAMMERING. Abraham: BY 1913, HE AND MILEVA WERE COMPLETELY ESTRANGED AND EINSTEIN RESUMED CONTACT WITH ELSA. Einstein: "DECEMBER 1913. "DEAR ELSA, IT ISN'T EASY TO GET A DIVORCE "IF ONE DOES NOT HAVE ANY PROOF OF THE OTHER PARTY'S GUILT. "SO I TREAT MY WIFE AS AN EMPLOYEE WHOM I CANNOT FIRE. "I HAVE MY OWN BEDROOM AND AVOID BEING ALONE WITH HER. "BUT HOW NICE IT WOULD BE IF ONE OF THESE DAYS WE COULD SHARE A SMALL, UNASSUMING HOUSEHOLD." Abraham: THE EINSTEIN FAMILY MOVED TO BERLIN IN APRIL 1914. IN JULY, AFTER JUST THREE MONTHS, MILEVA GAVE UP. SHE AND HER SONS RETURNED TO ZURICH. IT WAS OVER. IT'S STILL A GREAT SORROW TO ME THAT I HAVE BEEN CUT OFF FROM MY SONS. I EVEN THOUGHT OF SEEKING CUSTODY OF HANS ALBERT BUT IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION. MILEVA POISONED THE MINDS OF BOTH BOYS AGAINST ME. SHE WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE WITH JEALOUS OF EVERYONE, EVERYTHING. HOW COULD I HAVE MARRIED HER? Abraham: DESPITE HIS SENSE OF LOSS, THE HARSH TRUTH REMAINED: EINSTEIN NEVER HAD MUCH PATIENCE FOR EVERYDAY DEMANDS EVEN THOSE OF HIS SONS. Schulmann: THE DEMANDS OF THE CHILDREN WERE SOMETHING THAT HE FELT BADLY ABOUT REJECTING BUT HE SAID HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT A GOOD FATHER. I THINK THAT EINSTEIN REALLY WANTED TO MAKE A GO OF IT IN THE FIRST MARRIAGE BUT ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL, OF COURSE TO ASK WHAT WAS HE PREPARED TO SACRIFICE TO MAKE IT WORK AND THERE I THINK HE FAILS RATHER MISERABLY. Abraham: AMIDST SUCH PRIVATE TURMOIL EINSTEIN FACED HIS FIRST PUBLIC MORAL CHALLENGE. IN AUGUST 1914, WORLD WAR I BEGAN. THE WAR FEVER THAT GRIPPED GERMANY DISGUSTED EINSTEIN AND WHEN 93 LEADING ACADEMICS, INCLUDING HIS FRIEND MAX PLANCK ISSUED A MANIFESTO IN DEFENSE OF GERMAN AGGRESSION EINSTEIN HELPED LAUNCH A COUNTERPETITION URGING PEACE. IT GOT THREE SIGNATURES. Einstein: EUROPE, IN ALL HER INSANITY HAS STARTED SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLE. IN LIVING THROUGH THIS SO-CALLED GREAT EPOCH I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT I BELONG TO SUCH AN IDIOTIC, ROTTEN SPECIES... THE SPECIES THAT ACTUALLY BOASTS OF ITS FREEDOM OF WILL HEROISM ON COMMAND, SENSELESS VIOLENCE AND ALL THE LOATHSOME NONSENSE THAT GOES BY THE NAME OF PATRIOTISM. Abraham: A PACIFIST IN AN ARMED CAPITAL EINSTEIN LIVED AND WORKED IN ISOLATION ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF BERLIN. AMIDST EUROPE'S FOLLY, HE TURNED AGAIN TO HIS THEORY OF GRAVITY. HE FACED ONE LAST HURDLE. HE COULD NOT SOLVE THE MATHEMATICS OF CURVED SPACE-TIME. THE PROBLEM HAD STUMPED HIM FOR THREE YEARS. THERE WAS NOT JUST ONE FLASH OF INSIGHT WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT GENERAL RELATIVITY. EINSTEIN HAD TO COPE WITH THE MATHEMATICAL DIFFICULTIES. HE HAD TO REVISE HIS PHYSICAL IDEAS A NUMBER OF TIMES AND HE WAS READY TO GIVE UP, AT A CERTAIN POINT, DESPERATELY. I THINK, GUYS, WE NEED TO CHANGE THE PAGE. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS PAGE FIRST. Abraham: RENN AND HIS COLLEAGUES IN BERLIN HAVE BEEN STUDYING EINSTEIN'S NOTEBOOKS AND EINSTEIN'S STRUGGLES FROM 1912 FORWARD LEAP OFF THE PAGE. AND HERE YOU SEE THE KIND OF OBJECT THAT HE WANTS TO ISOLATE. THIS IS THE OBJECT WHICH WOULD LEAD HIM TO THE CLASSICAL THEORY OF GRAVITATION. Renn: WHAT YOU SEE IN THESE PAGES IS A HUMAN DRAMA UNFOLDING AND A DRAMA THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD MANY ENDINGS AND NOT ONLY GOOD ONES. HE WAS AT TIMES DESPERATE AND YOU CAN SEE ON CERTAIN OF THESE PAGES THAT HE TURNED TO A FRIEND TO HELP HIM WITH THE MATHEMATICS BECAUSE HE WAS NO LONGER KNOWING WHERE TO GO. Abraham: EINSTEIN'S FRIEND WAS MARCEL GROSSMAN HIS COLLEGE CLASSMATE WHOSE MATH NOTES HE HAD ONCE BORROWED. GROSSMAN AGAIN TUTORED EINSTEIN THIS TIME IN THE COMPLEX GEOMETRY OF CURVED SURFACES. Renn: GROSSMAN, YOU SEE? IT SEEMS HE HAS SET HIM ON THE ROYAL ROAD TOWARDS THE CORRECT SOLUTION OF 1915. Abraham: GROSSMAN GAVE EINSTEIN THE TOOL HE NEEDED TO COMPLETE HIS ANALYSIS OF GRAVITY. THE MISSING PIECES WERE FALLING INTO PLACE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME HE HAS SEEN IT BUT IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME HE'S LOOKING AT THESE TERMS BECAUSE HE ENCOUNTERED THEM ON THE PREVIOUS PAGES. THERE HE WAS STUMBLING WITHOUT THE MATHEMATICAL TOOLS HE NEEDED AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE GETS REALLY... Renn: AND ONCE HE STARTED TO SPEAK, SO TO SAY IN THIS NEW MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE HE ACHIEVED RESULTS THAT HE FIRST HAD TO GROPE TO UNDERSTAND. ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN STUDY ON THE BASIS OF THE NOTEBOOKS THAT HAVE SURVIVED IS ACTUALLY THE CORRECT SOLUTION WHICH THREE YEARS LATER HE WOULD PUBLISH TRIUMPHANTLY AS THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY. BUT WHEN HE FIRST EXPRESSED IT IN THIS NEW LANGUAGE HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT HIMSELF. Abraham: IT TOOK EINSTEIN THREE YEARS TO MASTER ALL THE SUBTLETIES. BY THE FALL OF 1915 HE WAS READY TO PUT THE THEORY TO THE TEST. THE ORBITS OF THE PLANETS WERE UNDERSTOOD WITH EXTRAORDINARY PRECISION WITH ONE EXCEPTION. MERCURY'S ORBIT SHIFTED SLIGHTLY... UNACCOUNTABLY... EVERY YEAR. Klein: IT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER PREVIOUSLY TOTALLY UNEXPLAINED. NOW, HERE, ON THE BASIS OF THIS THEORY WHICH HE HAD INVENTED OUT OF NOTHING IN A CERTAIN SENSE OUT OF HIS VIEW OF HOW GOD WOULD HAVE HAD TO MAKE THE UNIVERSE TO MAKE IT RIGHT HE'S ABLE TO CALCULATE THIS VERY REAL, SMALL EFFECT AND GET THE RIGHT ANSWER. THAT COULD GIVE YOU PALPITATIONS. AND I BELIEVE AT THAT MOMENT EINSTEIN SAID "I DON'T CARE WHAT THE WORLD WILL SAY. "I AM RIGHT, BECAUSE THE LORD HAS TOLD ME: 'CALCULATE THE PERIHELION MOTION OF MERCURY AND YOU WILL SEE.'" AND HE DID! AND IT CAME OUT. WHEN I FOUND THAT MY CALCULATIONS PREDICTED THE MOTION OF MERCURY EXACTLY SOMETHING SNAPPED INSIDE ME. THE FEELING WAS SO... SO EXTREME. I COULDN'T WORK FOR DAYS, I WAS BESIDE MYSELF. IN ALL MY LIFE I NEVER FELT SUCH JOY. Abraham: THE CALCULATION VINDICATED EINSTEIN'S RADICAL IDEA THAT SPACE-TIME IS CURVED. MERCURY, THE INNERMOST PLANET, SHIFTS ITS ORBIT AS IT TRAVELS AROUND THE DENT IN SPACE AND TIME CREATED BY THE SUN'S HUGE MASS. MASS EVERYWHERE DEFORMS THE SPACE AROUND IT. EVEN LIGHT, AS EINSTEIN HAD RECOGNIZED YEARS BEFORE MUST FOLLOW ALL THE CURVES IN SPACE AND TIME MAPPING THE SHAPE OF THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE. IT IS THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT DRIVES THE SCIENTIFIC STORY OF CREATION. THE BIG BANG, THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE THE STRUCTURE OF GALAXIES THE GREAT SWEEP OF MODERN COSMOLOGY DERIVES DIRECTLY FROM THIS SINGLE EQUATION: SPACE AND TIME ON THE LEFT, MATTER AND ENERGY ON THE RIGHT. THIS IS THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF GRAVITY. Kaku: GENERAL RELATIVITY IS IN A CLASS ALL BY ITSELF. WE ARE JUST STUNNED, EVEN DECADES LATER THAT HE COULD COME OUT WITH THAT THEORY BACK IN 1916. I WOULD SAY HE WAS 50 YEARS AHEAD OF HIS TIME. Abraham: EIGHT YEARS OF SUSTAINED EFFORT TOOK THEIR TOLL. EINSTEIN COLLAPSED, NEAR DEATH, IN 1917. HIS ILLNESS MARKED HIM. THIS PHOTOGRAPH FROM 1920 SHOWS THE CHANGE. HE WAS NURSED BACK TO HEALTH BY HIS COUSIN ELSA. THEIR RELATIONSHIP HAD COOLED DURING THE WAR BUT NOW HE NEEDED HER. Einstein: I HAVE GAINED FOUR POUNDS SINCE LAST SUMMER THANKS TO ELSA'S GOOD CARE. SHE HERSELF COOKS EVERYTHING FOR ME. Abraham: HER INFLUENCE SHOWED IN EINSTEIN'S RENEWED ATTENTION TO HIS APPEARANCE. FINALLY IN 1919, THE COUPLE DECIDED TO MARRY. EINSTEIN'S DIVORCE SETTLEMENT WITH MILEVA REVEALED CHARACTERISTIC SELF-CONFIDENCE. HE PROMISED HER THE MONEY FROM HIS NOBEL PRIZE DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE WOULD NOT WIN THE AWARD UNTIL 1922. EINSTEIN NEVER LACKED SELF-CONFIDENCE BUT THE SPRING OF 1919 WAS SPECIAL... EVEN FOR HIM. A SILENT FILM EXPLAINED EINSTEIN'S BREAKTHROUGH TO THE PUBLIC WITH ANIMATION BY MAX FLEISCHER, CREATOR OF BETTY BOOP. GENERAL RELATIVITY PREDICTED THAT STARLIGHT PASSING CLOSE TO THE SUN WOULD CURVE AROUND THE WARP IN SPACE-TIME CREATED BY THE SUN'S MASS. THAT BENDING OF THE LIGHT WOULD MAKE THE STAR SEEM TO OCCUPY A NEW POSITION IN THE SKY TO AN OBSERVER ON EARTH. THIS COULD ONLY BE SEEN DURING A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN. A BRITISH EXPEDITION TRAVELED TO THE SOUTH ATLANTIC IN 1919 TO PHOTOGRAPH AN ECLIPSE. IT WOULD BE THE FIRST PUBLIC TEST OF EINSTEIN'S THEORY. MAY 29 DAWNED OVERCAST OVER THE ATLANTIC. BUT THEN THE SKY CLEARED... AND IN THE SHADOW OF THE ECLIPSE LIGHT WARPED AROUND THE SUN. GRAVITY BENDS LIGHT EXACTLY AS EINSTEIN HAD PREDICTED. AND WHAT WOULD I HAVE THOUGHT IF THE ENGLISH HAD FOUND NOTHING? I SAID AT THE TIME, "I WOULD FEEL SORRY FOR THE DEAR LORD. THE THEORY IS CORRECT." FOR ME, GENERAL RELATIVITY WAS SIMPLY TOO BEAUTIFUL TO BE FALSE. IT WAS INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE ENGLISH WOULD COME BACK PROVING ME WRONG. Abraham: THE ECLIPSE RESULTS WERE ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER. LITERALLY OVERNIGHT, EINSTEIN BECAME WORLD FAMOUS THE FIRST SCIENTIST CELEBRITY OF THE 20th CENTURY. THIS WAS THE BIRTH OF EINSTEIN THE ICON THE EMBODIMENT OF SCIENTIFIC WISDOM... A FRIENDLY, INCOMPREHENSIBLE SAGE. IN THE AFTERMATH OF A DEVASTATING WAR HE WAS THE PERFECT HERO FOR HIS DAY. Pais: THE YEAR WAS 1919. THE WORLD WAS IN A CHAOS BECAUSE THE FIRST WORLD WAR HAD ENDED NATIONS WERE TIRED EMPIRES HAD FALLEN AND THERE COMES THIS LITTLE MAN WHO SAYS "I PROCLAIM THERE ARE NEW LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE." IT WAS A HISTORIC MOMENT, YOU KNOW AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF CONFUSION. IT'S LIKE MOSES COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAIN WITH THE TABLETS. Abraham: EINSTEIN, THE GERMAN, ACCEPTING HONORS AT A FRENCH UNIVERSITY WAS MORE THAN A SCIENTIST. HE WAS A SYMBOL OF THE HOPE FOR PEACE. Children: EINSTEIN! EINSTEIN! RA, RA, RA-RA-RA! RA, RA, RA-RA-RA! Abraham: NO SCIENTIST HAD EVER RECEIVED SUCH PUBLIC ADULATION. YES, THAT WAS REAL NICE, YES. LOVED THE CHILDREN... AND SO HEALTHY, SO HEALTHY. Abraham: WHEN EINSTEIN AND FELLOW SUPERSTAR CHARLIE CHAPLIN CROSSED PATHS, THE TWO COMPARED NOTES. WITH FAME I HAVE BECOME MORE AND MORE STUPID WHICH, OF COURSE, IS A VERY COMMON PHENOMENON BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT ALL WITH GOOD HUMOR. CHARLIE CHAPLIN HAD IT RIGHT. WHEN HE AND I MET WE WERE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE CALLING OUR NAMES. "WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?" I ASKED HIM. "NOTHING," HE REPLIED. Abraham: NOT QUITE NOTHING. EINSTEIN DID ENJOY SOME OF THE PLEASURES THAT FAME CAN BRING AS HE BEGAN TO STEP OUT IN BERLIN SOCIETY. BUT EINSTEIN'S BASIC STYLE REMAINED UNCHANGED ESPECIALLY AT HIS COUNTRY HOUSE AS PETER PLESCH, SON OF EINSTEIN'S DOCTOR, RECALLS. Plesch: HE NEVER CARRIED A HAT WHEN HE WAS OUT IN THE SUN WHEN HE WAS SAILING WHEN HE WAS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. AND IF THE SUN, HE THOUGHT, GOT A BIT TOO STRONG FOR HIM HE WOULD TAKE OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND HE WOULD, UH, PROCEED TO MAKE A HAT FOR HIMSELF BY KNOTTING THE CORNERS. AND THIS ACTUALLY IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE THE TURNING OF A FLAT SURFACE INTO A CURVED SURFACE IS REALLY A VERY INTERESTING PHYSICAL PHENOMENON SINCE RELATIVITY THEORY HAS AS ONE OF ITS INGREDIENTS THE CURVATURE OF SPACE. AND THE PRACTICAL DEVICE WAS VERY PRACTICAL AND IT WORKED LIKE THAT WITH THE FOUR CORNERS AND THAT WAS HIS HAT. Abraham: THROUGHOUT THE 1920s ELSA REVELED IN HER HUSBAND'S INCREASINGLY PROMINENT POSITION. BUT EINSTEIN DREW SHARP LINES BETWEEN THEM. THEY HAD SEPARATE BEDROOMS, SHE WAS NOT TO ENTER HIS STUDY AND EINSTEIN KEPT COMPANY WITH OTHER, YOUNGER WOMEN. Einstein: MARRIAGE IS THE UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO MAKE SOMETHING LASTING OUT OF AN INCIDENT. ALL MARRIAGES ARE DANGEROUS. Schulmann: EINSTEIN HAD WANTED SEX WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS. HE ALSO WANTED RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS CLOSEST FAMILY MEMBERS WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS. THE PURSUIT OF LADIES IN THIS CONTEXT, THEN IS ONE WHERE THE SENSE OF OBLIGATION IS AT A MINIMUM BUT THE PURSUIT OF PLEASURE IS MAINTAINED AND THE PURSUIT OF THE GREATEST PRIORITY, PHYSICS IS NEVER IN QUESTION. MY FRIEND BESSO HAS LIVED HAPPILY WITH THE SAME WOMAN FOR THE WHOLE OF HIS ADULT LIFE. I FAILED TWICE, RATHER DISGRACEFULLY. I CAN LOVE HUMANITY, IT SEEMS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CLOSE PERSONAL TIES WITH INDIVIDUAL MEN AND WOMEN I AM A HORSE FOR SINGLE HARNESS NOT CUT OUT FOR TANDEM OR TEAMWORK. Abraham: BUT FOR IMPORTANT CAUSES EINSTEIN WOULD BREAK HIS SOLITARY RULE. AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR HE CAME INCREASINGLY TO ALLY HIMSELF WITH A GROUP HE HAD LEFT BEHIND IN CHILDHOOD... THE COMMUNITY OF EUROPEAN JEWS. ANTI-SEMITISM WAS SPREADING VIRULENTLY IN GERMANY. SOME GERMAN SCIENTISTS EVEN ATTACKED EINSTEIN HIMSELF FOR WHAT THEY CALLED HIS IMMORAL, "JEWISH" PHYSICS. IN RESPONSE, EINSTEIN, EVER MORE PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS A JEW. I AM GLAD THAT YOU HAVE ME GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXPRESSING TO YOU HERE MY DEEP SENSE OF GRATITUDE AS A MAN, AS A GOOD EUROPEAN, AND AS A JEW. I AM A JEW, CERTAINLY, BUT NOT A PRACTICING ONE. IT WAS DIFFERENT WHEN I WAS A BOY... I WAS VERY FERVENT. I EVEN SANG RELIGIOUS SONGS ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL BUT THEN I READ MY FIRST BOOKS ON SCIENCE. SO MUCH FOR THE FACE OF ABRAHAM. AND YET OVER TIME I'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT BEHIND ANYTHING... BEHIND EVERYTHING... IS AN ORDER THAT WE GLIMPSE ONLY INDIRECTLY. THIS IS RELIGIOUSNESS. IN THIS SENSE, I AM A RELIGIOUS MAN. Abraham: IT WAS EINSTEIN'S DEEP BELIEF IN THE ORDER OF NATURE THAT LED HIM FIRST TO PONDER THE MYSTERY OF LIGHT AND TO ARRIVE AT HIS SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY. IT LED HIM ON TO INCLUDE GRAVITY IN HIS EXPANDING PICTURE OF THE UNIVERSE. BUT EINSTEIN'S ABIDING FAITH THAT NATURE MUST MAKE SENSE SET HIM ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE NEXT GREAT BREAKTHROUGH IN PHYSICS. IN 1927, THE FIFTH SOLVAY CONFERENCE BROUGHT EINSTEIN TOGETHER WITH THE LEADING PROPONENTS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY THEORY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS... THE DESCRIPTION OF NATURE AT THE VERY SMALLEST SCALE. WHILE EINSTEIN HAD FOCUSED ON THE LARGE-SCALE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE YOUNGER SCIENTISTS, LED BY WERNER HEISENBERG AND NIELS BOHR EXPLORED THE ATOM AND THE TINY BUILDING BLOCKS OF ENERGY AND MATTER CALLED "QUANTA." THESE YOUNG RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT UNCERTAINTY AND RANDOMNESS GOVERN THE PHYSICS OF THE VERY SMALL. EINSTEIN HIMSELF HAD PIONEERED THE STUDY OF THE QUANTUM BUT HE LOATHED THE NOTION THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING UNCERTAIN IN NATURE. I DON'T DENY THAT QUANTUM MECHANICS IS USEFUL UP TO A POINT BUT I AM CONVINCED THERE IS A DEEPER THEORY THAT WILL REPLACE THE UNCERTAINTY AT THE CENTER OF IT. AS I TOLD NIELS BOHR GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE WITH THE UNIVERSE. UNFORTUNATELY, I FAILED TO CONVINCE HIM. Abraham: BOHR'S REPLY: WHO WAS EINSTEIN TO TELL THE LORD WHAT TO DO? IT IS A CERTAIN ARROGANCE IN THE SENSE, YOU KNOW, THAT HE... THAT EINSTEIN SAYS, "GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE." HOW DOES HE KNOW? AND BOHR, OF COURSE, IS ENTIRELY RIGHT. YOU CAN'T KNOW WHAT THE LORD HAS UP HIS SLEEVE. Abraham: EINSTEIN NEVER WARMED TO QUANTUM MECHANICS DESPITE A LIFETIME OF ARGUMENTS WITH BOHR. HE HAD GRANDER AMBITIONS... A THEORY THAT WOULD UNIFY THE FUNDAMENTAL FORCES OF NATURE WITHIN A SINGLE, COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE. FEW OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES THOUGHT SUCH A UNIFICATION POSSIBLE. NO MATTER. EINSTEIN HAD GONE HIS OWN WAY BEFORE. HE WOULD DO SO AGAIN. Einstein: I HAVE BECOME AN OBSTINATE HERETIC IN THE EYES OF MY COLLEAGUES. I'M GENERALLY REGARDED AS A SORT OF PETRIFIED OBJECT RENDERED BLIND AND DEAF BY THE YEARS. I FIND THIS ROLE NOT TOO DISTASTEFUL AS IT CORRESPONDS VERY WELL WITH MY TEMPERAMENT. IT WAS A WILLED CHOICE ON HIS PART TO DO WHAT HE FELT ONLY HE COULD DO BECAUSE MOST OF PHYSICS MOST OF THE PHYSICS COMMUNITY WASN'T INTERESTED IN PURSING HIS IDEA OF A UNIFIED FIELD THEORY. HE FELT THAT IT OUGHT TO BE DONE BECAUSE IT COULD LEAD TO A NEW FOUNDATION FOR QUANTUM MECHANICS AT LEAST, HE HOPED IT WOULD AND, UM... HE WOULD DO IT AND IF THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT, WELL, TOO BAD. Abraham: "UNIFIED FIELD THEORY" WAS WHAT EINSTEIN CALLED HIS STILL-UNFORMED IDEA. IT WOULD SUBSUME RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS WITHIN A FORMULATION SIMPLER AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN EITHER. HE WOULD SEEK HIS UNIFIED VISION FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE... BUT ALONE, IN EXILE. IN THE LATE 1920s, THE NAZI PARTY'S POWER GREW STEADILY. BY 1932, ADOLF HITLER WAS ON THE VERGE OF BECOMING GERMANY'S DICTATOR. NO ENEMY WAS SAFE... ESPECIALLY THE MOST FAMOUS JEW IN THE WORLD. EINSTEIN HIMSELF HAD ALREADY RECEIVED DEATH THREATS. AND AS HE HAD AS A BOY, HE ONCE AGAIN PREPARED TO FLEE GERMANY. LEAVING WAS ALMOST A RELIEF. Einstein: I HAVE NEVER REALLY BELONGED TO ANY COUNTRY OR STATE TO MY CIRCLE OF FRIENDS... OR EVEN MY FAMILY. IN FACT, MY NEED TO WITHDRAW WITHIN MYSELF HAS INCREASED OVER THE YEARS. MY ISOLATION IS OFTEN BITTER TO BE SURE BUT I'VE NEVER REGRETTED IT. IF I AM CUT OFF FROM THE UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY OF OTHERS I AM ALSO INDEPENDENT OF THEIR OPINIONS AND PREJUDICES. Abraham: IN EARLY 1933, EINSTEIN AND ELSA SET SAIL FOR THE UNITED STATES. THEY NEVER RETURNED TO EUROPE. Reporter: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PROHIBITION, PROFESSOR? ICH TRINKE NICHT ALSO IST MIR DAS GANZ GLEICH. HE DOESN'T DRINK AT ALL SO HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN THIS QUESTION. Abraham: EINSTEIN NEVER LOST THE ABILITY TO PLEASE A CROWD. BUT HIS NEED FOR SOLITUDE BROUGHT HIM TO THE QUIET COLLEGE TOWN OF PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY. EINSTEIN SETTLED QUICKLY INTO A ROUTINE WALKING EVERY MORNING TO HIS OFFICE AT THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY AND RETURNING IN THE AFTERNOON TO HIS MODEST HOME ON MERCER STREET. HE NEVER LEARNED TO DRIVE. IN AMERICA, EINSTEIN GAVE FREE REIN TO HIS ECCENTRIC STREAK SHOWING UP WITHOUT SOCKS FOR HIS INDUCTION AS A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES. EINSTEIN ALWAYS REFUSED TO PLAY THE ROLE OF THE PROPER PROFESSOR. THIS WAS EINSTEIN, THE WISE SPRITE. BUT ALL THIS GOOD HUMOR MASKED GROWING ISOLATION. IN 1936, HIS WIFE ELSA DIED AFTER A BRIEF ILLNESS. EINSTEIN WROTE TO A FRIEND THAT HIS BEARISHNESS WAS ACCENTUATED BY ELSA'S DEATH WHO, HE SAID, "WAS MORE ATTACHED TO HUMAN BEINGS THAN I." EINSTEIN NEVER SAW MILEVA AGAIN. SHE DIED IN 1949. HIS SON EDWARD, A SCHIZOPHRENIC, REMAINED CONFINED TO AN ASYLUM IN SWITZERLAND UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 1966. HIS OLDER SON, HANS ALBERT BECAME A PROFESSOR OF ENGINEERING IN CALIFORNIA BUT SAW HIS FATHER ONLY RARELY. THE QUEST FOR A UNIFIED THEORY CONTINUED. EINSTEIN NEVER FOUND IT BUT HIS SENSE FOR THE IMPORTANT QUESTION REMAINED UNSURPASSED. Kaku: SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT EINSTEIN WASTED THE LAST 30 YEARS OF HIS LIFE CHASING AFTER THIS UNIFIED FIELD THEORY. WELL, I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ALL GREATLY INDEBTED BECAUSE EINSTEIN SHOWED US THE WAY. TODAY, UNIFICATION IS THE NAME OF THE GAME. WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF PHYSICISTS NOW TRYING TO UNITE THE NUCLEAR FORCE WITH GRAVITY AND THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCE. WE ARE ALL INDEBTED. WE ARE ALL ESSENTIALLY INHERITING THE MANTLE THAT EINSTEIN LEFT FOR US. Abraham: EINSTEIN PASSED THE WAR YEARS QUIETLY. HIS FAMOUS LETTER TO ROOSEVELT URGED NUCLEAR RESEARCH BUT EINSTEIN HIMSELF HAD NO ROLE IN BUILDING THE BOMB. AFTER THE WAR, THE OUTSIDE WORLD WOULD SEEK OUT EINSTEIN FOR VIEWS ON CAUSES OF ALL SORTS. DAVID BEN GURION EVEN CAME TO MERCER STREET TO OFFER EINSTEIN THE PRESIDENCY OF THE NEW STATE OF ISRAEL. TO THE RELIEF OF BOTH, EINSTEIN DECLINED. SCIENCE STILL CAME FIRST EVEN IF HIS UNIFIED THEORY STUBBORNLY REFUSED TO TAKE SHAPE. FINALLY, IN THE SPRING OF 1955 EINSTEIN'S HEART BEGAN TO FAIL. HE ENTERED THE HOSPITAL, AND THEN, ON APRIL 15... Pais: HE CALLED HIS SECRETARY. HE WANTED HIS FOUNTAIN PEN, HIS GLASSES AND HIS LATEST PIECE OF NOTES. AND EINSTEIN, OF COURSE, KNEW THAT HIS TIME WAS IMMINENT TO GO BUT HE WANTED TO CALCULATE AND HE SAT DOWN ON THE BED AND CALCULATED. THAT IS A STORY THAT MAKES YOU SHUDDER. IT MAKES ME SHUDDER. HE KNEW HE WOULD NOT SEE WHATEVER WOULD COME OUT OF THESE CALCULATIONS BY WAY OF ACHIEVEMENT. IT DIDN'T MATTER TO HIM. Abraham: EINSTEIN DIED JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT, APRIL 16, 1955. HE WAS 76. ALBERT EINSTEIN CHANGED FOREVER OUR CONCEPTION OF SPACE, TIME, THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE. TO HIM, THAT WAS WHAT TRULY MATTERED. "THE REST," HE SAID, "COULD BE FORGOTTEN." Einstein: IN MY LIFE, I HAVE ALWAYS SOUGHT TO GAIN JUST A GLIMPSE OF THE ORDER THAT LIES HIDDEN IN NATURE. ALL SCIENCE REQUIRES FAITH IN THE INNER HARMONY OF THE WORLD. OUR LONGING FOR UNDERSTANDING IS ETERNAL. SPACE, TIME, LIGHT, MATTER. LEARN MORE ABOUT THE THEORIES AND THE MAN THAT CHANGED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSE.
