I called his house and his mom said he's still in the shower, so go ahead. - Well, all right. - What's up, Winslows? So, what's the skinny? Estelle and I have set the date for our wedding. So, Grandma, are you gonna be a June bride? Not exactly, honey. We'd like to get hitched sooner than that. - How much sooner? - In two weeks. Hey! I already had a shower. Mother, it will take a miracle to pull off a wedding in two weeks. What's the rush? You're not in the family way, are you? That would really be a miracle. The reason why we're moving so fast is we have a terrific deal on a honeymoon cruise. Great. Where you guys going? Who cares? We'll be in the stateroom the whole time. - Mother. - Oh, loosen up, Carl. It's a Caribbean cruise, and it leaves in two weeks, honey. Look, folks, we don't want a lot of fuss, just a simple ceremony. Wait, wait. Hold it, hold it. Time out. This is my mother we're talking about here. - I want her wedding to be spectacular. - But, Carl, I'm trying to... Mom, I want a big, traditional wedding for you. Big church, reception at Chez Josephine's... ten-piece orchestra, the works. We'll invite everybody we know. I'll be there. On the other hand, we should draw the line somewhere. Okay, you can come too. Eight seconds left. The Hoyas and the Blue Devils are tied. Inbound pass over to Jenkins. - Ooh, yes! Yes! - Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! He shoots! Swish! The Hoyas win! - Yeah! - Yeah! Yes! Yes! Yes! Get off me! Did I do that? - Hi, guys. EDDIE: Hey, Mom and Dad. Okay, Harriette, we've reserved the church for the wedding. I have to call the caterers, and you have to call the florist. Carl, it's only been three days and I'm exhausted already. Hang in there, honey. We're gonna relax after the wedding. We are? CARL: Mm-hm. Sgt. Grunwald is loaning us his cabin at Lake Waxahachie. At a really good price too. - How much? - Free. I like that price. Goodness gracious. I am shocked and dismayed. What are you talking about? Your parents are just now getting married. No, man, my grandmother is getting married. Oh, my God. It's worse than I thought. It's frightening. Soon, you'll be able to vote. - Yo, Einstein flash. - What is it, Weasel? Your parents are gonna be gone for a whole weekend. That means we can get stupid. - We can? - Relax, Waldo. You're already there. We can have a flyer party. What in the name of my Aunt Annie is a flyer party? You print up flyers, pass them around the neighborhood... and then charge 15 bucks to get in. Even us? WEASEL: No. Dang. We'll only charge you 10. Cool. - A flyer party. I like that. - Me too. I have some doubts. - Care to hear them? - No. Look, Waldo, you make up a thousand flyers. But I'll get writer's cramp. Make one, then xerox it. Oh, cool. I'll spread the word to all the honeys. Heh, heh. Guys, here's to a great party. - Do it! - Do it! Do it. Good news, Fletcher. Wedding plans are right on schedule. It's gonna be grand. The grandest, most spectacular ceremony that this neighborhood has ever seen. But it's not what Estelle and I want. Fletcher, your job is to say, "I do." And my job is to find the most expensive way for you to say it. But Estelle and I want to keep things simple. You know, Fletcher... you keep telling me what my mother wants. Well, I mean, I had an idea... You see, I think I know a little bit better than you... about what my own mother wants. - Well, I just had ideas about... - Because I am her son. Her firstborn. Her punkin-pooh. Well, I was just saying that Estelle wants a small, simple ceremony. - Mother! - What is it, Carl? Fletcher seems to think I'm going overboard with the wedding. He says that you two want a small, simple ceremony. - That's right. - Say what? Well, we tried to tell you before, but you wouldn't listen. Oh. Oh, well... Well, uh... I'm listening now. Yeah, you two are coming through loud and clear. You two go ahead and have your small, simple ceremony. You won't get any more interference from me. Heh, heh. - Because I won't be there. - But... Carl, the caterer called with a beverage and appetizer suggestion. A nice Chardonnay and liver pâté. Harriette, my mother just informed me that she wants a small, simple affair. So please call the caterer back and tell him it's Kool-Aid and cocktail weenies. - Carl, what happened? - I don't wanna talk about it, Harriette. In fact, I am washing my hands of this whole wedding business. Carl, we need to talk. Oh, look who's here, the no frills bride. He's all yours. - Carl. - Yes? Did you mean what you said? That you won't attend your own mother's wedding? Mama, I told you from the very beginning... that I wanted to give you a big, storybook wedding. Why didn't you say something then? But I thought when you found out how expensive it was... you'd pull back a little. No way. I want the best. I don't care what it costs. But these fancy plans you're making will put a dent in your savings, honey. I know. Why would you do that? Because you are my mother. All of my life, you made sacrifices for me. Mama, I can remember you scrimping and saving just to get the things that I wanted. Mama... do you remember the time I wanted that new bike? I was 10 years old. - It was red, wasn't it? - That's right. A cherry-red Schwinn... with headlights, an electric horn, and big Western saddlebags. Oh, I remember. Your best friend, Bobby Johnson... he had one, and you had to have one too. Yeah, but Daddy said we couldn't afford one. But you... you took the money you had saved for a new dress for your high school reunion... and you went and you bought me that bike. The store wanted five dollars for delivery, so I rode it home. I bet the neighborhood is still talking about that wheelie you popped. Your face lit up when you saw that bike. And that meant more to me than all the dresses in the world. I just remember that I kept... thinking that someday, somehow... I was gonna pay you back. And I thought that this was gonna be my chance. A big, beautiful wedding to say thank you. Honey, you don't have to say thank you to me. But I appreciate the appreciation. Mama. Oh, Ma. I'm sorry I got carried away. You just tell me exactly what you want, and I'll make it happen. Well, let's see. How about... a nice garden ceremony? Yeah, right here at the house. A moonlit wedding under the stars. Oh, Mama, that's a great idea. Good. Oh, I love you, Ma. And I love you too, my punkin-pooh. Come on, son. You're gonna be late even for your own wedding. I wanna save some energy for my honeymoon. - Oh, hi, Carl. - Hi, Fletcher. I want you to meet my father, William Thomas. Well, nice to meet you, sir. My friends call me Skippy. Oh, okay, Skippy. Heh, heh. This is my son, Edward. My friends call me E-Man. Yeah. Carl, your mother is a fine-looking lady. Well, thank you, sir. Thank you. She have an older sister? Dad. - Carl. Fletcher. - Hello, Steve. Skippy. Eddo, Eddo, Eddo! The nuptials have developed a slight snafu. - What's wrong? - Well, you remember our flyer party? The one I am clearly on record as being totally against? Yeah, what about it, Steve? Well, tell me again. Refresh my memory. When is that party supposed to be? - Next Saturday. - Wrong, cummerbund breath. Waldo put today's date on the flyers. Right now you have over 100 crazed teenagers in your backyard ready to boogie. What? Steve... Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. - Pardon me. Pardon me. - Excuse me. Pardon me. Hey, how's it going? What's up, brother? Waldo. How could you mess this up? Hey, cut me some slack. I only got the date wrong on one flyer. My mom is the one who really messed up. She xeroxed it over and over and over and over... - Over and over and over. - Eddo! Eddo! Easy. Easy, Eddo. Yeah, chill. Observiate the bright side. Bright side? What bright side, Weasel? Look at this. Fifteen hundred dead presidents. And the homies are still coming in. Get rid of them. This is my grandmother's wedding and... Fifteen hundred? No, no, no. This isn't right. These kids will ruin everything. They gotta go. Come on, loosen up, Eduardo. Look, I clued everybody in. We all stand here nice and quiet until gramps and granny make it legal. Then we partay! See? No problem. - Edward. - Problem. - Heh. - Edward... - who are all these kids? - Oh. Caterer trainees. Try again. Oh, Fletcher has a bigger family than we thought. Heh, heh. Why not try the truth? Okay, Dad. Me and the guys were gonna have... a flyer party next Saturday when you go out of town. But Waldo messed up and put the wrong date on the flyers. All these people think the party is tonight. All right, right now we're gonna have a wedding. But directly after that we're gonna have a funeral. Steve, why are you walking so slowly? Because I want this moment to last forever. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here this evening... to unite this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Who gives this woman away? I do. And by the way, I wasn't too cool about Fletcher in the beginning... - but after a while he grew on me and I... - Excuse me. It wasn't an essay question. Sister Crawford. Inseparable That's how we'll always be Inseparable Just you and me It's so wonderful To know you'll always be Around Me Inseparable That's how it is Inseparable For the rest of our years It's so wonderful to know You'll always be Around Fletcher Thomas, do you take this woman to be your wife... for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health... to love and honor for as long as you both shall live? I do. Estelle Winslow, do you take this man to be your husband... for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health... to love and honor for as long as you both shall live? Sugar, I sure do. The ring, please. What God has joined together, let no man put asunder. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Edward. Great wedding, huh, Dad? You know, son, if screwing up ever became an Olympic event... you would win the gold. One hundred and fifty extra people... at what was supposed to be a small family affair. Now, can you give me one good reason... why I shouldn't ground you for the rest of your life? Well, we took in 2000 dollars, Dad, and we want you to have it. I love you, son. Heh, heh. You're a fine young man. You'll be spending the month of May in your room, but you're a fine young man.
