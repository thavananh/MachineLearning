Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- EPISODE 1 Careful, slowly. God bless you. God bless you, good kids! Welcome, good to see you, Abu Mahmoud's finally left the house. -My darling. -Oh, I just wanted her to stop nagging. It's good like that. -You should adjust it a bit. -Did you think she would stop nagging? -I just wanted you to go out, Abu Mahmoud. -Hi, Um Mahmoud. -Thank God, he is better now. -Thank you, Nadia. So you say I'm nagging you because I want you to go out? Come on, Mahmoud, it's obvious that he is teasing you. -Okay, I am off to work. -One moment, before you go. -Rasheed. -Yes, sir. Get me two bananas for Mahmoud. -Two bananas! -No need to bother. Not at all, just go and don't worry about him. He is in safe hands. -I have no doubt, Abdallah. -Darling. -Bye, now. -Bye, now. Enjoy the bananas. Thank you. Come, darling, let's go, easy! -Good morning. -Hey, Hanane, how are you? -Are you going to work? -Yes, I am. -God bless you. -Thank you. -Be strong. -Excuse me. May God be with you. But this country is... -God bless you. -Thank you. Welcome, Mrs. Hanane. -How are you? Hope you're doing well. -I am fine, by the grace of God. Thank God. I've prepared lunch for you. -I hope you'll like it. -Thank you. -Please come in and rest a while. -No, thank you. I still have work to do. -Take care. -Excuse me. God be with you, you're such a great lady! -Abdallah? -Yeah. Why is the lettuce 3,000? It has always been 300. I no longer know how to price the items. The dollar rates are different every day. And the merchants are charging us a lot. We're not paying dollars for our vegetables. God damn them! They're humiliating us, as if we are dogs! By God, that is true. By the way, Abdallah, this supposed food parcel they are talking about in the news, what's in it? Rice, sugar, oil, sardines, tuna, things like that. I swear, people don't have money to eat. And the bread prices are higher than cars! -What are you doing here? -Bringing the zucchini, Mom. Go back to your room and study, now! People are in dire need. -No more schools... -Abdallah! -Where are the zucchinis? -Coming right now. Rasheed, take the zucchinis to Mrs. Sariah. Right away, sir. So, tell me, Sariah, surely the basket is empty today as well. If only you would stop spilling secrets in front of people. Put the zucchini in it and it won't be empty anymore! But your debt is getting bigger, Mrs. Sariah. As you know, the dollar is going up and lira is going down! And I am losing the value of my money. Put them in the basket. If only you'd understand the situation I'm in, because the crisis is still going on. And I still consider your situation. Never mind, Amine will give you your money at the end of the month. Good morning, Sariah, what's the matter? How can it be a good morning? As if! Let's have some coffee, it'll calm you down. Such a cheap scumbag! Get out of my way! Did you hear that, Macho? As if all I need is to be shamed by a shop owner! As if cleaning people's houses is not humiliating enough! Listening to you, you'd think you were the daughter of a big shot! I'm not the one who forced you to clean people's houses. My father the big shot, left me this house that is sheltering both of us. And that poor girl as well. What did your father leave you except misery? -Mind your words, Sariah, or else. -I will mind my words. Do you know why? I have no interest in fighting with you! And you, take this, fold your laundry! Just so you know, I am not paying the grocery bill. I have to pay the electricity bill. And for our food and drinks. You should pay him with the taxi revenues that you are gambling away. I am discovering something new about you every day. How could it be that I don't know that my darling wife plays the harmonica? I used to play it when I was little. I just thought that I had forgotten it, but it seems like I still remember. So you've had it since you were little? Yes. Who bought it for you? My father, rest his soul. My darling, can we talk for a little bit? Can we save it for later? You know I don't like to talk in the morning. You don't like to talk to me anytime of the day. Tell me, Reem, why are you running away from me? Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Hadi? Hadi? Can you remind me, when was the last time you hugged me and told me you love me? When was the last time you slept in my bed? What is happening to you? Am I exaggerating? It must be you. Is it me or you? Don't you be late to pick me up. I want you to be here at 5:00 sharp. It's true that I have a taxi, but I don't work for you, Sariah. Don't forget whose money bought this taxi. No, I haven't forgotten. Come on, get out and save me from your bitter tongue! I wish to leave! Hey, wait a minute! Listen to me. One minute after 5:00 and you will be in trouble! Good morning, Siham. Good morning, Mona. -How can it be good, Sariah? -Why, what's the matter? Mr. Hadi woke up on the wrong side of the bed. The lady must have given him a hard time! As usual. Pass me the garlic, it's behind you. Tell me, what does she need? He is such a handsome man. He loves her and he grants her all of her wishes. He is giving her such a luxurious life. -How come she's such a proud woman? -How would I know? There's nothing I can say. I'm speechless. When I first met her, she was such a sweetheart. And she played that role until she became powerful enough. She doesn't even share a bedroom with him! What are you saying? -Swear it! -I swear. She buries herself in the library all day long and at night, she stays outside in the cold, just like a crazy person! Things have been like that between them for over a month now. A month? -Nothing at all? -I swear it, nothing at all. Well, never mind. It has been several months for other people! Tell me about it! -Who is it? -Rasheed. My day wouldn't be complete if I didn't offer you the best bouquet. -Hey, where are you going? -What? -You can't come in. -No? -These flowers smell so nice. -And they are so expensive! Even the cauliflower is for 6,750 now! -I love you. -I adore you. What are you doing, just go. Someone might come. Okay, I'm leaving. Your flight is at 5:00, isn't it? You know that I'm leaving today. And you remember my flight time, awesome! We're really making progress! I know you're unhappy, and it's been a while. -I am not happy either. -What is it that you want, Reem? Help me understand, what do you want? Tell me, what do you want? I want a few days on my own to think it all through. You are thinking on your own every day. Haven't you reached any conclusions yet? Aren't you done thinking yet? Make me understand. What is it that you want? Tell me! -Only what makes us both comfortable. -And how could we be comfortable? Tell me. You have no answer, you resort to silence, as usual. Fine. While I'm gone, be on your own and think very carefully. I'm ready for anything. For anything, Reem. Even a divorce? Have a safe trip, Mr. Hadi. Good morning, Mr. Hadi. -Mr. Hadi, Mr. Omar is asking about you. -I don't want to see anybody. Hi, Sonia, is he here yet? -Come in, Omar. -Good morning, boss. You're drinking this early in the morning? Tell me, what is going on with you? Everything is going on with me. No doubt this is about Reem. I don't know the reason. I don't know. I'm going crazy. I don't know what makes you live with such a complicated and moody person. She wasn't always like that. She was nothing like that, I don't know what happened to her. Something happened to her and she won't tell me. -Something like what? -I don't know. Had I known, I wouldn't have spent the last three months guessing, not being able to understanding her. Can I tell you something? No offense. I have never liked your wife. God. That's not what you thought of her when we were introduced at the Piano Bar. Yes, back then, I gave you my opinion about her thinking that it was a one-night stand, just for your pleasure, nothing more. Who would marry a girl he only met two months ago and still doesn't know anything about? That's me. I loved her. I really loved her. What about her? Did she love you back? What's the matter? Take me to the airport. I don't wanna get stuck in traffic. -Go to sleep, little girl -Me, me, me... -In order to fall asleep at the mat -Me, me, me... -Sleep in the dark -Me, me, me, me, me, me, me... -Until the clouds goes away -Wait a minute. And you'd have... That's for you. A small house Just take it easy. Go to sleep... She gave you more. I want that. Little girl In order to fall asleep at the mat Sleep in the dark Until the clouds goes away And you'd have a small house Do you remember when I used to sing that song for you and you used to sleep on my lap like this? I remember. I remember everything about those days. Every moment and every second. Although it was difficult. Still, it's easier than now. Do you know what I did today? What? I played the harmonica that you bought for me when I was little. I bought it for you when you were just eight years old. You kept it with you? I kept everything from those days. Everything. Isn't it time for you to forget the past? Forget? How can I forget? I mean, think about your present and your future. I have no present and no future. I have nothing, Hanane. You do. Yes, you do. You can start a new chapter. I didn't keep my promise to the only person who's stood by me all my life. Love justifies everything. Except betrayal. Except betraying our days together, Hanane. Is it him? Aren't you going to answer the phone? His flight must be taking off now. What am I going to say to him? What would I tell him? Oh, my darling. Enough, calm down. Passengers for flight 326, please proceed to gate number 12 to board the plane. I'm sorry. Never mind, it happens. Thank you. -Mrs. Reem. -What? Excuse me for scaring you. Would you like me to bring your dinner here? -No, I don't want to eat. -First, you haven't had anything yet. -And she made some grape leaves... -Mona! I don't want to eat, I don't want to deal with anyone in this house, please. -Hi, how are you? -One moment. Are you aware of the word that you said, because I keep thinking about? Divorce? Just like that? By the way, I'm waiting for your answer. Speak to me, Reem. Answer me! Let me know. You'll know my answer when you come back from your trip. Welcome, welcome, welcome, Prince of the Grey-Haired Men. So, Haleem, hope you're in good esteem! Are you happy about Sousou and Grazy? -Of course he is. -Of course! -We're taking care of him. -Great, great. What about you guys? All is well here and here? Great, perfect. What's with you? Why the long face? Whenever I look at you, I never get to see your teeth! Show me your teeth, show me your teeth. Yes, like that. You are so beautiful. No, I'll get the door. You go and engage that one, that customer there, come on. All is well? Great. Welcome, welcome, Prince of Young Men, welcome. I haven't seen a lot of you lately. I thought you'd forgotten all about us. Is it possible to forget about you? I've been under pressure lately. Under pressure all those months? How come? Don't worry, I will compensate you. I will keep coming to your place. Great, now you're talking. I'll tell them to prepare the best table for you. No, I'm not playing tonight. Oh, I get it, you naughty boy! You know? I won't hide anything from you. I have three new girls. They're amazing, totally new! -So, pick the one you want. -I did! Who is she? The girl standing there, wearing black. You have good taste. Yes, that's Fifi. Yes, Fifi is very expensive. I mean, you always pick the expensive ones, I don't know why. Had I chosen another girl, you would've told me the same thing. "This one is the most expensive." I've already learnt that lesson. You've always been a smart man. -My darling. -And you've always been so tricky. So, come on, now, drink your drink, it's the first room on the right I want a shot of tequila. Do you believe in coincidences? No. Neither do I. But this has happened too much, right? At the airport, at the hotel. Our rooms are next to each other. Why are you following me? What do you want from me? I think you are the one following me. You think so? Sahar. Hadi. You raise your glass, but you don't look your drinking partner in the eye. You get seven years of bad luck in love. That means I still have six and a half years to go! So I said. You're drinking all the time, and... nothing makes a man drink more than a woman. Am I right? You're close. There's a ring on your left hand. That means you're married. That means the woman is your wife, right? Right. So you've been married for nearly six months now. Since you said you still have six and a half years of bad luck. Only six months and you're fighting already? Three months. We started fighting during the third month. Oh. If you're bothered by me sitting next to you then I can leave. Actually, I'm not bothered at all. Maybe later, you'll be bothered by me. Why? Because I'm not going to be pleasant company on this particular day. I'm in a bad mood. I will be the one to decide that. By the way, this time if you don't look me in the eye, you will get about 13 and a half years of bad luck in love. So, tell me. -Tell you what? -Your problem with your wife. Sorry, it's none of my business since we don't know each other. But I am curious to know what the story is between you two. I'm curious to know what the story is between us too. Believe me, I don't know what the problem is. I don't know what's wrong with her or what she wants. I don't know anything. Only a woman would understand a woman like her. So, tell me. I'm a crazy man! I married her after two months. A woman that I don't know. Everything was good. And suddenly she changed, I don't know what happened to her. It's as if she became a different person. She became distant, she doesn't talk, she doesn't care. She lives in another world. I don't know what happened to her. A woman who doesn't care is a woman who is not in love. Are you here, my darling? -God bless you. -God bless you too. Come, my darling. -You're still awake. -I am not sleepy. Every time Reem comes here, you lose your desire to sleep for a week! -Who told you that she came here? -I saw her in the neighborhood. And every time she comes, the children keep talking about her. About her car and the money she gives them. What good are money and cars when you have no peace of mind? Please, Aunty, what does she need? She has everything. Listen to me, Rasheed. The richest person in the world isn't the person who has money and cars, it's the person who has peace of mind. Such is the greatest blessing in life. And those who don't have it don't have anything. Come on, man, it's not a big deal! Perhaps you're not in the mood. It's okay, we'll make it up the next time. Enough, man, pull yourself together, it isn't worth it. Hey, where are you going, man? You're amazing, that was so fast! Omar, you're leaving? Omar! Who knows what she's done to him? That bastard! She's driving me crazy! What did you do to him? The customer left and he looked destroyed! I didn't do anything. How can that be when he looked so angry? What happened? The problem is that... nothing happened! -That's why he's angry. -No, you are lying! Something happened and you won't tell me! You bastard, tell me what happened now! -I told you, nothing happened. -How come nothing happened? How? He's a gentleman. All right, darling. Fix your makeup and your beautiful figure. The night is still young. By the way, you are so strange. Why am I so strange? It's the first time in my life I've seen a man suffering because of a woman. Usually, the women are the ones who suffer. She weakens, she cries. Not the man. Let me tell you something. There's no man and woman in love. It's about who's more in love. And usually, the one who loves more is the weaker partner. Not because he is weak, because he loves her that much. It seems you love your wife much more than she loves you. Let's play a game. A game, what game? It's called Never Have I Ever. Never Have I Ever? What is that? A game called Never Have I Ever. For example, we name something. Say, "Never have I ever fallen in love." If that's you, then you drink a shot, if not, you don't. Say, "You've never fallen in love." If you've been in love, you drink, if you haven't, you don't drink. All right. Never have I ever fallen in love. So, you didn't drink your shot. Because I've never been in love. -I don't believe in love. -Is there such a woman? There is... me. -Never have I ever met such a woman. -So, you have to drink. Because you've met me. Never have I ever cried. I guessed right. -Because you look sensitive. -It's not that I am sensitive. Everybody cries. In our society, they teach the man not to cry, because he is a man. Yeah, but... he cries in private. Never have I ever told a lie. No, don't tell me you're not drinking it, because I don't believe you at all. -White lies, I swear. -I will pretend that I believe you. Never have I ever cheated. Don't tell me you're not drinking it. I will say that you're not a man. I've cheated. But believe me, I didn't cheat on my wife. Again, I'll pretend to believe you. I am serious. Never have I ever been cheated on. What? Do you have doubts that your wife is cheating on you? Excuse me for five minutes, I'll be back. MY LOVE
