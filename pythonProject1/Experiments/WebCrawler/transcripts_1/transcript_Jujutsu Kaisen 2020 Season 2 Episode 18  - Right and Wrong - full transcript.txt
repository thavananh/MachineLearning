Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- Why should I be sentenced to death? It's all your fault. I don't want to regret the way I live. But what if the person you save ends up taking someone else's life? You're going to die amidst a crowd. You've already been sentenced to a secret execution. Anyway, I've already decided how I'm going to die. Are my mother and I both cursed by people? What is the correct way to die? The value of life becomes vague. Even the worth of important people can become unclear. I'm scared of that. It's all your fault. You're going to die amidst a crowd. Go help others. I can't die. So, I never regretted saving you. Then we are accomplices. I will never lose again. I will win. Go to the underworld and apologize to my brothers. You're strong. Go help others. Are you ready, Itadori? People will die. It's inevitable. Then I hope at least they can die properly. When you get killed by a curse, will you also blame your grandfather for it? I hope when I die, there will be many people sending me off. I noticed that among the lives I took, some of them could also cry. Those people died because of you. (Episode 42: Right and Wrong) (JUJUTSU KAISEN Shibuya Incident) Malaysia. That's right. Malaysia. I should go to Kuantan. I'll build a house on an empty beach. The books that I bought but never read have piled up like a mountain. I want to read them slowly, as if I'm retrieving the time lost. No, I should go to save Fushiguro now. Where are Maki and Mr. Naobito? What happened to them? I'm tired. I'm really tired. Yes, I'm tired. I've done enough. Here you are. I'm here, as always. Here you are. I'm here, as always. Would you like to say a few words? After all, you've played with me many times. Haibara, in the end, what do I want to do? I once ran away. But I came back for a vague reason like sense of achievement. No, this isn't right. No, Haibara. I can't say such things. This could become a curse on him. Nanami... No. No... Itadori. I'll leave the rest to you. What is this? What is this, Mahito? You don't have to shout. I can hear you! Yuji Itadori! Save me. Save me. Soul Multiplicity. Body Repel. If you stood firmer, I might be able to punch through your face. Why did you kill so many people? If I count and kill while looking troubled, will you be satisfied? I'll do that next time. Regarding your endless prattle, I'll respond in the same way. Yuji Itadori. Save me. You are me. Don't get mad over everything. This is just the curse talking nonsense. But still, as long as you don't acknowledge this, you are destined to lose to me. You talk too much... Is this your last words? I'll leave the rest to you. If it were Nanami, he wouldn't lose his cool out of anger. I want to prove - you're a... - I'm a... Jujutsu Sorcerer. Not bad, keep it up. The second round begins. (JUJUTSU KAISEN) (JUJUTSU KAISEN) 11:19 P.M., SHIBUYA STATION, DOGENZAKA TICKET GATE Oh no. If I take a risk and mess up, I'm as good as dead. For now, I'll mainly attack the transfigured humans. How terrifying. He has more moves than before. Brat. Hey, hurry over here. There are tons of monsters there. It's too dangerous! That guy is up there? I'm sorry. No place in Shibuya is safe now. You should keep away... Damn it, he... Hey, you. Don't you think you lack some imagination? Stop. Are you an idiot? It's up to you. This trick is more effective against Itadori's soul. Also, we'll have one more trump card that's enough to crush you. - What? - Wait... Alright, swallow... Yeah. I have enough in storage. As for the humans except ones below, deal with them as you please. Then let's continue with the Killing Itadori Show. No! Jogo. Then come get me. I'll go underground, and you stay up there. Wait for me to call you back. I know that already. That's true. RUNNING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS Bye-bye. He escaped. Mahito! 11:16 P.M., DOGENZAKA ALLEY 11:16 P.M., DOGENZAKA ALLEY Did you see that? 11:16 P.M., DOGENZAKA ALLEY Ridiculous, right? I was wandering there not long ago. Patchface... Is it you? The special grade cursed spirit that messed with our guy? How annoying. Am I a celebrity? Yeah, you're the famous one who ran away cowardly. Not bad. You are worth my time to kill. I haven't shown anything good today anyway. As I remember, his technique is related to souls. And I can't touch his hands. At least, I have to exorcise a worm that ran away. I have to recall the core of Cursed Energy that I grasped back then. Terrible aiming. Hairpin. Very impressive. But this is basically ineffective against me. It seems she's probably close with that guy. I might as well show her corpse to Yuji Itadori to severely damage his soul. Psychological test. Who do you remember most vividly? The one you like the most or the one you hate the most? The result will be announced after the release of the title.
