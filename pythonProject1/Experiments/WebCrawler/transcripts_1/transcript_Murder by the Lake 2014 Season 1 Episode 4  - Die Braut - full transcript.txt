Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- Maja? Maja? Maja, please. Maja! Maja, where are you? Maja, come on. Maja, please. - And? - Nothing so far. And Christian? - By himself? - Yes. Simone Sugg-Hofmann I'm sorry. What's he doing here? Get out of here. Get lost. Lunatic. Maja? - How's the move going? That's not why you called. Not you. There was a death at a wedding. But I'm OK with going there alone. Can you take the plant? - Hang on. Stop, you can't do that. - Plants never survive a move Repotting never hurt a plant. And you promised... To be repotted, like a plant. I know. - To get involved in our new home. - Yes. I'm sorry, you're right. But... A case? Zeiler, just send me the info on how to get there. I'm sorry, but you have help, don't you? I'll be as fast as I can. Mr. Hoflinger... - Just a brief word... .The cormorants. What about the cormorants? They bring death. My colleagues will take you home, OK? The family is at the party. The traditional abduction of the bride. But not a traditional ending. Poor guy. Sea ravens. Cormorants. No one is supposed to come here. Strictly forbidden. - Because of the nests. - Murderers ignore prohibitions. Yes, that's true. The killer didn't hide her. On the contrary, he put her on display. On her wedding day, of all days I heard her face was hidden by a veil. Are you OK? Yes. Look, a birdhouse. Or is it a camera? It's empty. That would be too good to be true. The Cormorant Society. Sounds like a sect. Not everyone is interested in old heaps. - Heaps? - Cars. That is, old cars. They were already married, right? You celebrate after the ceremony, not before. You know how it works. Though you're not the marrying kind. Where one partner becomes a potted plant with nothing to say? Anyway, the ceremony was over. Then it's missing Her wedding ring. Maja is dead. Her abductors. Five men, and one woman. Good friends, apparently. They carry her through the woods. Take her to the boat Put on the blindfold. And then they disappear. The distance to where she was found is half a mile. She was attacked and probably murdered here. At least, the blindfold was here. Then the killer must've taken the boat to the cormorants. But why all that fuss? Arranging the body? You're not tuning out again, are you? What was that, just now? I know how hard this is. Your parents, the sailing accident. But we're at Lake Constance, Zeiler. Yes, I know. - I'm just saying. You can't go into shock every time you look at water. The lifejackets. They reminded me of something. We'll do anything to find whoever did this. I'll kill him, no matter who it is. - I understand your pain. - No, you don't. It's probably no coincidence that it happened today. Did anyone object to the marriage? Find out. I'm sorry. I'll be in touch. Maybe the wedding dress is his trigger. - A sex offender? He didn't have much time. Unless he followed the boat along the shore. Then he'd have had two hours with her. - In the woods? Maybe he has a fetish. A business-like killing for a nut, isn't it? A crazed mind can support evident contradictions. You know about those, don't you? Take it easy, you fool. He's gone. - Funny. - Definitely. Where were you? Where was Did you see anything? Don't mess up, Philip. Do you understand? Yes. A long time ago, one night bound us together forever. Since then, our destinies are connected. Whether we want it or not I'm sure you won't forget me. Will you? So, my dear nighttime friend... how many monthly installments is a human life worth to you? How many monthly installments is a human life worth to you? So Komlatschek, making any progress? It's chaos. I've got hundreds of pictures on the computer. Everything is digital. Everyone's a photographer. It must be looked at, but this is who was where at what time. Everyone has an alibi, or no one. - Not really a surprise, is it? And the video of the abduction? There's nothing useful in it. - We were just there. - Exactly. The groom was there half an hour after the abduction. He only found the blindfold. She and the boat were gone. Excuse me, it's my wife. What is it, Kim? I'm tired, I want a shower and you have the soap. -l know, but right now... You have the toiletries Toothbrushes, deodorant. This is a bad time. Go to the store, it's just around... Kim? Damn it. - You notice anything? - Like what? May I? A woman talking to a man. Zeiler? - I hate guessing games. It's the guy from the woods. Who ran when he saw us. He must've been there for a reason. An uninvited guest? A rejected lover, maybe? That would be classic. If anyone objects to this marriage, let him speak now. That only happens in movies. You've really never been to a wedding, have you? The woman is interesting. She's the key to the guy. Find out who the woman is. I'm going home. I have the damn soap in the van. - Yes? - Where are you guys? Luna's still with my parents, and I'm having dinner. Is this a joke? I saw your shadow in the... I sit the bedroom? Kim? What's going on? I packed some necessities for you. They're at the door. You're throwing me out? - You haven't been in. Please take the boxes out of the van. - Stop this nonsense and let me in - Why are you against this move? We're close to my parents, school, we have our own house... No, you have your own house. Your parents paid, remember? Good evening, sir. Is this the latest reason you keep running away? - Micha, I just want a home, at last. - What do you expect from me? That you want it, too. And us, as a family. - I'm tired, it's been a rough day. - Where do I sleep? - In the van. The van? Are you serious? - Is that stupid because it was my idea? - Maybe. Think about what you want. And don't come back if you feel it's a burden. Listen, Kim, now... I don't believe this. It's deathly quiet in here now, isn't it? It wasn't easy to get her out of the tight dress. - Any leads? - Not many. Or rather, too many. An endless number of DNA deposits. That's not really useful. Except for eliminating options. True. A bride is congratulated all the time. Countless kisses and embraces. First of all, a powerful blow to the back of the head. To break her resistance. Do we know what kind of object it was? Something hard and blunt. An iron bar, perhaps. The hit probably made her lose the blindfold, which the groom later found. And then her neck was broken quickly and efficiently. Not a sex killer, then. He would've relished the act. Yes, it was a practical, swift killing. No traces of semen, no signs of sexual abuse... either alive or post mortem. Then why did he pose the body? The missing ring, the veil... It just doesn't fit. Thank you, I mean... For your trouble. Beauty grows from untold trouble. - It was on the deck. - Who'd do something like that? Maybe someone thought Maja hid the camera here. This is a sight for sore eyes. Cheers, then. - Good evening, colleagues. - It gets better. You know the drill. Dear colleague. License and registration, please. - But I'm not driving. - The engine is on, this is a public area. I'm not even at the wheel. - Then how did you get here? - Sober. - You've been drinking. The engine's on. You're kidding me, right? Right? Oh, this guy. This is impossible. Hey. - Good morning. - What are you doing here? You picked me up last night and drove me here. I drove the van over here. You were in the van. -You gave me the key. Only to use the bathroom. And I've been there. Listen. It gets damn cold in that van, at night. I couldn't let the engine run until the gas ran out. And what are we talking about? You have plenty of room. Why are only women given houses by their parents? I don't get it. This won't work. - What? - I want my key. Figure it out. It's like a puzzle. The toilet seat. It's always the toilet seat. Wait here. If you need something to do, you can join me at the firm. You can help me at the office. I could show you everything I think some distraction would do you good. Maja's dead, and I should be distracted from it? I built the company for you, my boy. You just have to say yes. We've discussed this, Dad. Christian, please come back. Listen to your father. We miss you. Please. You've lost your second child. But Christian lost his wife. He needs his parents now. That's for the toilet seat, Zeiler. I got it. So a German can lose his license in Austria. The papers are sent to Germany and you're put on trial, Komlatschek says. How nice to be discussed. And then there's the idiot test. -I wasn't driving, I sat in the back. That was idiotic. Jule Dombrach. She has a society in Germany, the Cormorants. A friend of the victim, Maja Eberle. Stop the Murders Zeiler, please. Wonderful. Can I help you? - I'm sure you can. Oberlander, Lindau police Ms.Zeiler. - You lobby for the cormorants? They're special animals. They say they have mystical powers. In Germany, they're still hunted illegally by fishermen. - Why? - Cormorants eat one pound of fish a day. They're almost extinct on the lake. Only 400 breeding pairs left. We demand regulations, like in Austria. We? We're looking for this man, in the middle. The little one. I like them a little more mature. Well, I'll be. Hello. - The same to you. Please come up. Mr.Schiernhammer, you were at the wedding. But you weren't invited. What were you doing there? I wanted to say something. When they asked if anyone objected to the marriage. Like in The Graduate? They don't ask that. Only in the movies. - Really? - Yes, really. Why did you run away in the woods? I was... afraid. I was upset. I panicked. Did Maja know you had feelings for her? No. I never told her. I wasn't ready yet. Or you couldn't handle that Maja got married? We know you were at the party and were gone when the abduction began. Yes, I followed the bride abductors. I wanted to see Maja again. She was sitting there alone. In the boat. Then you broke her neck and put her against the tree. No.I heard noises, didn't want him to see me. I found Philip after the abduction and brought him here. I didn't want him to disturb the party. When I went back, they were all looking for Maja. We found footprints around the tree where the body was. Yes. I go there regularly, for the camera box. But there was nothing in the box. - The poacher found the camera. - It's not there to count the birds? No, to catch Meinert, who keeps killing the animals. Meinert? - Anton Meinert, a fisherman. He claims the cormorants eat all the fish, so he kills them. He's capable of anything. Yes, I understand. Thanks. We don't have enough to arrest Schiernhammer. I just spoke to the DA. And that could also be a case of slander. He's killed cormorants, he was sentenced for it. But Meinert's a poor bastard. He catches a few fish to eke out a living To be honest, I don't see a link to Maja Eberle. No motive. - But still. - All right then. My nighttime friend, is a bought life worthless to you now? Do you want to abandon me? After all these years? Then we'll find out how much your love is worth to you. You can't give up now, Christian. We'll find out who did it. Definitely. Thank you, Jule. Maja's mother is trying to manipulate Christian, damn it. - How are you doing? - Stop asking that. You're not making it any better. I'll keep running the company for you, but you have to talk to your wife. - Boss, she has a right to know. I'll tell her! At the right time, Tobias. That's how you talk when you still have time. I bet Maja knew the killer. If there's proof of that, it would be here, right? Mrs. Eberle? Hello? Mrs. Eberle? - Everything all right? - Is everything all right? I made this dress for the wedding. I made her wedding dress too, but she could sew much better than It's beautiful. Have you seen the wedding dress? Do you get along well with Christian's parents? We're incompatible. Our families, I mean. The Hoflingers are rich fishermen, we're poor tailors. I know exactly what you mean. My in-laws were against my marriage They thought it would fail. - It was a big hassle. - But it ended well, didn't it? Yes, it did. Did Maja have a fight? Professionally, or with friends? No. She was always so cheerful and everyone loved her. - Do you know Jule Dombrach? - Yes, a school friend of Maja's. They often built these wooden boxes together. My wife. Pick it up. You're not spending another night at my place. Excuse me. Yes Kim, what is it? What? This is my Maja. You don't care? Neither do I. At least she'll have a grave. Moritz didn't get one. - Moritz? - Moritz is my son. They were twins. Maja and Moritz. Fraternal twins? The lake took him. He was only granted six months. Only six months. - What happened? An accident on the water. He was on the water at only six months old? It was 28 years ago. - And the father? - The children simply happened. I didn't even know his name. But he was so kind to me. I found a way to deal with Moritz's death. I'll deal with Maja's too. Is there really a way to deal with it? I'll show you something. - Did you find all this on the lake shore? Yes, over the years. But Moritz never turned up. His grave is empty. This is my way of remembering, of grieving. You collected things. Sometimes I still do. The pain doesn't go away. Nobody can understand that. - Not true. I understand. Where did you get this? - That was ages ago. Twenty years. Was it in the water, or... Can you remember? Please? On the jetty in the old industrial port. Kim, don't get so worked up. No, I can't pick Luna up from your parents' Because I'm working. No, not on my lunch break either. Not this time. I simply can't, OK? And don't hang up... Fuck! You lost your license. Why don't you tell her the truth? She never believes me. That I'm sorry, that I love her. Why would she believe I wasn't drunk driving? I should drive. - Please. Don't you start either. Lifejackets. That's your thing, isn't it? Dr. Lena Golding Child Psychologist For 30 years, this woman has collected everything that washed ashore. My parents often took me out on the lake. I was often bored on the boat, as a child. That's why you were painting? I'm going, this is absurd. Maybe I'm imagining things. It could be. If not, he made it to the shore. The question is, did your father take it off on land... or did he lose the jacket in the water, and did it float to land? You look exhausted: It's my job. Do you want to tell me about it? You know it's confidential. Time to clock out. Why are you still here? I have work to do. You always sleep in the van when domestic bliss is absent. Jule Dombrach. That woman is on my mind. I understand. What do we know about her? Dombrach, Juliane. Witnesses saw her at the church She was photographed at the buffet... and filmed during the abduction. She wasn't photographed for a while, then she was back at the wedding. She took Philip to the cormorant ship. Then she had enough time to return to the bride in the boat. - Only the abductors knew the spot. - It was generally known. Most people knew where it was. Only the groom didn't. Anyway, we should check the woman out. - And by 'we', you mean me. - Yes.Please. There's a sleeping bag in my office, in case you're sleeping in the van. Good night. Thanks. The missing ring, choosing the wedding day. The way she posed at the tree, all alone. The killer wants to tell us something. - You think so? Don't you? The veil hides the face of the dead woman. Maybe the killer can't stand the sight. - Out of remorse? - It's possible. So the killer didn't just have feelings. The murder had a purpose. Yes, I'd agree with that. So the motive is as pragmatic as the act itself. The missing ring, the veil... they're meant to distract us from the real reason. You have to take your time for this. No more excuses. This is a low-light, infra-red camera. It's state of the art, apparently. - Brand new? Did you steal it? - Are you scared? That's not it. I.. - What is it, then? - Maja. - Are you starting that again? - It's creepy. You should've seen her. - Did you see the body? - Did you see who killed her? - No. She was already against the tree. I checked the camera, but the box was empty. Why didn't you tell me before? - Why did you give me an alibi? Because we're a team, Philip. Of course I understand why you don't want to go back there now. I'll go to the tree, I'll spare you that. You take the peninsula across from it. I'd give anything, even my life... if I could undo all this Please... Please don't shoot. I didn't see anything. Please. Where were you? He was there. I didn't see his face. He has the camera. Shit. Jule Dombrach went to juvenile prison for ten years when she was 16. She was released after eight years and therapy. - What had she done? - She had priors for aggravated assault. Then she attacked her boyfriend during a fight. And pushed him out the window. 7th floor. Intentionally, was the verdict. Blind love and jealousy. You shouldn't get her angry. Maybe she's the possessive type. She wants someone and grabs him The groom, perhaps? - She wants him, and kills his wife. Murder for a simple reason. That would fit. Drombach claims to have taken Philip to the ship around this time. - It could be false. - Philip played along. As an accomplice, or out of self-interest. Once she had the alibi, she had her chance. And a motive. I’m sorry, The door was open. Anything the matter? - I can't tolerate these things. - Sleeping pills? Afterwards, I feel worn out all day. What's the matter? Do you know that old fisherman, Meinert? Anton Meinert? Funny you should say that. I saw him a lot, lately. As if by accident. I thought he wanted to tell me something. What about him? I was out last night, for the cormorants. I saw him. - Where? - The tree. Where you found Maja. - Oberlander? - Nothing. Well? - Nothing here. They left, damn it. They knew we were coming. Cool patrol car. Shall we go? Oh, a butterfly knife. Banned in Germany. - Are we in Germany? - It's a weapon in Austria, too. You have a record, you can't carry weapons. Do you want a receipt? Fifty euros. You like going through strangers' stuff? - It's amazing what you find there. Good cop, bad cop. The good one is the one with the coffee. Exactly. I've read the file. - And what's in the file? - That you killed your boyfriend. That was ages ago. An accident. The verdict was murder. But that's not what's exciting. No? So what is? The way you met your boyfriend. Love at first sight. You walked in front of his car. Accidentally. When he didn't want to obey you anymore, he flew out the window. - And? - And Christian Hoflinger? You also walked in front of his car? You plan all this very carefully. You stage-manage and manipulate, and if it goes wrong, someone dies. You're wondering if I find this romantic. So you know exactly what love is, do you? Explain it to me. Love is when you know who you want. When you know exactly what you want. Without any doubts or questions With complete abandon. That is love. I didn't kill Maja. - But I know what led to her murder. - I can't wait to hear it. You don't know Maja was with the Cormorants briefly, did you? She helped us with the camera boxes. She was very skillful. She built and installed the boxes for us Maybe she wanted to check the film, and found the footage. Then, she must've known who was killing the cormorants. And that's why she had to die. - But she didn't tell you, did she? - Unfortunately not. But it was Meinert. I saw him there yesterday. Her statement checks out. I spoke to Maja's mother. She and Jule did make the boxes for the cormorants. Stay with Jule's fairytale hour, I'm going to Meinert. Be careful. Don't let the woman get too close to you. Should I call you a taxi? - I'm serious, Zeiler. - So am l. Mr. Meinert? Inspector Oberlander, Lindau police. I'd like to talk to you, Mr. Meinert. Mr. Meinert? Mr. Meinert? A broken neck, caused by the fall from the stairs. A quick test showed an alcohol level of 1.6 per ml. The left hand is badly affected by rheumatism. Yes, but... - Doesn't matter. He stood at the top of the stairs and fired. Yes. Booze, a shotgun and the recoil: A bad combination. He shot at someone and hit the wall. - Or maybe not. He heard me coming, wanted to flee and the gun went off. And the signs of forced entry? He may have broken the door down himself. Forgot his key. We have to treat this as a homicide. No matter how you perceived it. It was most likely an accident. I'm going to the station. Talking about going. My brother-in-law works for the force. - My driver's license. Thanks, Komlatschek. - Just for the record, you owe me one. - Yes, of course. Mr. Oberlander, we found something. OK, good. This is definitely Maja Eberle's wedding ring. How did it wind up at Meinert's? Only the killer could've taken the ring. As long as we don't have the footage, we don't know if he had a motive. Maybe we'll get lucky and find the camera. I admit the case is presenting Some riddles. But I'm glad to say forensics has given us something. A kind of fastidious bookkeeping It shows that Meinert received a fixed amount per month for 28 years. It didn't go through his bank account, he got the money by mail. These entries match the envelopes we also found at Meinert's. One day after the postmark, or the barcode nowadays.. A deposit was added to the list. Can we track the letters' source? Through the barcode. We asked for the security footage from the post office. Are you all right? Yes. Shall we talk? - About what? - Your urging Christian to take over. Please tell me Tobias, I'd like to talk to you. This delivery was late, we have to repack it. Yes, take that out. What's this about, Mrs. Hoflinger? Erich is keeping something from me. So you come to me? -I'm just a simple employee. No, you're much more than that. Erich doesn't talk to me I'm sorry, I really have to hurry now, all this has to go out. What's wrong with him? Please tell me. You suspect it, don't you? He's sick. Please come with me. Leo, the fish. What's the matter with him? He's dying, Mrs. Hoflinger. Your husband has cancer. He doesn't want anyone to know. Thank you, Tobias. Please be there for him. Yes, of course. Of course. You enjoy it, don't you? Letting people stew. Anton Meinert is dead I can't work miracles. I had nothing to do with his death. Schiernhammer told my colleagues you didn't take him to the boat. Why did you lie? I didn't want you to draw the wrong conclusions because of my past. I can't prove I stayed at the wedding. That doesn't mean I didn't. You have nothing on me. That makes you furious. And fury is an elemental force. You know I can keep you here for another 20 hours. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Everything OK? Yes, sure. We have the security footage, and Komlatschek found this at Meinert's. Maja and Christian must've seen the sign. Yes, you had the evidence cut out. So blind, so stupid. I can hardly stand it. I got involved. I made a huge mistake, and those two have to pay. Boss? Boss? Hello? I know you don't want the hospital. We'll take you home. - Did you tell my wife? - Yes, she knows, It's better this way. She'll take care of you, and ll handle the rest. OK. Boss, I'll always be there for you. According to the barcode, the last letter was handed in at 2:20 pm. This is Tobias Wagner, an employee of Erich Hoflinger's. He had an eventful life behind him at 20 Gambling debts, burglaries, social problems. Someone who always needs money. He was almost beaten to death back then. There was a trial, but Wagner suddenly withdrew his statement. He never got into trouble again. - I have something else. - You're unstoppable. This USB drive was found at Maja Eberle's. The footage from the camera box? It was hidden in the eye socket of a mannequin. This footage was on the drive. Here he comes. Tobias Wagner again. Nobody's home. No. That's the situation. We simply have to deal with it. - We can't just barge in like this. - Hello? Excuse me. - How did you get in? We wanted to talk to Wagner. He lives here, doesn't he? We're discussing important family matters. Erich. - Excuse me. Hello. Anton Meinert, the fisherman, is dead. What? We found audio recordings in his house about you and your wife. On your wedding day you said you'd kill your wife's murderer. - Do you think Meinert was the murderer? - Zelier. Is that why you went to his house? Did you want revenge? -What is this shit? Is that why you're here? Just say yes or no, then we can move on. - Are you serious? - No. Not like this, in any case. No. I wasn't there So we won't find any fingerprints? On the tape, Meinert mentioned a sign you and Maja should've seen. And that someone cut out the evidence. What did he mean by that? Meinert also said he made a mistake, and you and Maja had to pay. I didn't know the man, OK? The fishermen hate us because of my father's imports. That's enough. We're having a difficult talk. You're right, excuse me. We'll get back to you. Zeiler. Please. See you later. That was nasty. What about Tobias Wagner? I have to check something. I'll be in touch. - I can hardly wait. - If you haven't clocked out yet. It's possible. Moles are hereditary. The spot, size and shape can be identical. Why? - Is Maja Eberle still here? Can I see her? The left lower arm. Christian has a scar in the exact same spot. Interesting coincidence. What if it's not a coincidence? If a sign was cut out of Christian Hoflinger's arm? - Maja had a twin brother, didn't she? Yes. What's the matter? -His name was Moritz? Yes. What's wrong? Maja had this mole on her left lower arm. Did Moritz have the same mole in the same spot? Yes. - Shall I cheer you up? - Absolutely. Something bizarre or something odd? - You decide. Anton Meinert is listed as a resident in a home for seniors. Meinert and Katharina Eberle, Maja's mother, once lived together. They were a couple. It was around the time her child died. Meinert said he went sailing with him. A storm came up, the boy drowned. Was this the bizarre or the odd news? - You decide. Tobias Wagner regularly sent money to Meinert in envelopes. But it was never debited from his bank account. It wasn't his own money. Then it must've come from old Hoflinger. Of course. And Tobias Wagner had to do the dirty work. Killing the cormorants and the ring framed Meinert. To make him the fall guy for Maja's murder. Two birds with one stone. Exactly. Sorry to bother you, Is your husband home? This is a bad' time. He's very sick. - What's wrong? He has cancer, the final stage. I'm very sorry. We won't be long. Erich, I'm sorry. Hello, Mr. Hoflinger I'll miss this view. Katharina's son didn't die as an infant did he? He grew up with you as Christian Hoflinger. No, Christian came from abroad Through this agency. Johanna... My wife... We couldn't have children. One day, Meinert came to me. And yes, I took over his boy. What? Christian is Meinert's child? Yes, so? It doesn't matter. Christian is still our son. Maja and Christian are siblings, and you knew? I did. I did all I could, I offered Maja money to get out of our lives. But she was stubborn. And then that stupid wedding. Bullshit. Johanna! We were both poor devils at the time. Meinert and I. He remained poor, and I didn't. We got together one night. Then he told me the children weren't his Then I made him an offer. We were nighttime friends. The richer I became, the more he wanted. For 28 years. Did you kill Maja? Did you kill Maja? I asked you a question! Maja was your sister. And that's why she had to die? Who did it for you? Tobias? Did he kill Meinert too? If you kill your father, he won't care. But you shouldn't become a killer. Don't do it. It won't change anything. Give me the gun. Please. Hello, Kim. I've got something for you. It's a soapbox. And now I want to come home. To you. Is there soap in it? And bath foam as well. You don't even know where the bathtub is. That's true. What now? You get on board and I push you out? We got the boat here. You wanted to get on the water and remember. It was my fault. I insisted on going out onto the water. I'm afraid.
