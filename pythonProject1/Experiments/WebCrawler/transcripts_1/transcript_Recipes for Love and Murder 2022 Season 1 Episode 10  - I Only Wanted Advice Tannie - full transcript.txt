Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- [Maria] Previously on "Recipes for Love and Murder..." We have to find the killer. First Martine and now Lawrence. [sobbing] [crashes] Jessie's already missing. Do you wanna join her? [clicking] I know who paid Martine. I know who drugged the pomegranate juice. [groans] Uh, Jess. [screams] [instrumental music] Give me the phone. So was there...any particular place that he liked to go hunting? -He took my dad to his cabin. -Where is his cabin? I'm hungry. [Van Wyk]Get up. [tense music] What recipe would you recommend, hmm? Here, fresh. Killed today. For Jessie. Oh, Jessie. [chuckles] Yeah, she thought she was so damn bright. [shot fired] [Van Wyk] She didn't even figure out that Martine was blackmailing me. I gotta give you credit... hmm, you spotted the blackmail. [inhaling deeply] Hmm. But I'm afraid it's too late for Jessie. [panting] [thuds] Her mother died two months before Mickey did. Then we have to do what's right. [bubbling] [knocking on door] [knocking continues] [McClintock]Hello, this is the police! [banging on door] [McClintock]Hello, ma'am, this is the police. Are you okay in there? [banging on door] [McClintock]Hello, ma'am? This is the police! Open up! Hello ma'am, we're responding to your call. He's dead. [instrumental music] I'm gonna need some help in here. I'm so sorry, ma'am . The soup's probably burnt too. [siren wailing] [theme music] [chopping] [music continues] [tense music] [panting] [Van Wyk]Maria! Tannie Maria! [music continues] [panting continues] [snake hissing] [heavy breathing] Run, Tannie, run! [music continues] Tannie Maria. [clicking lips] Where are you? [grunting] [groaning] Aah. [music continues] I only wanted a little advice, Tannie Maria! [sirens wailing] [water gushing] Maria! [music continues] Oh, ah! [panting] [Van Wyk]Why couldn't you just help me?! [cows mooing] [shot fired] [cow groans] Stupid, stupid, stupid! Jess! Jess. Jessie. Jess? [dramatic music] Jess. Jessie! [suspenseful music] [gasps] Shh. Just follow me. [branch crackling] [panting] Jessie. [breathing heavily] [metal clanking] [gunshot] [music continues] [creaking] [tense music] [water splattering] Khaya, the steak. -What? -I-I cooked the steak! [groans] [Khaya] Run, Maria! Run! [dramatic music] [gunshots] [water splashes] Bastard. [instrumental music] [soft music] [door squeaking] [door shuts] [phone vibrating] Hello? Piet! Yes? Oh. Oh, thank goodness. [Hattie]And she's not hurt? No, she's completely fine. Yeah, now we just have to find Jessie. [Piet]There's evidence she was here, but there's no trace of her now. Now, we have to start searching soon, so we'd better get organised. Yes. Thanks for letting me know. Bye. [wind whooshing] Hi, Ms. September. I'm just letting you know that we're starting a search party for Jessie. [sighs] I'm sure you're doing everything you can. Yeah, we'll find her. Thank you. [sighs] [soft music] [breathes deeply] So after he brought you here? Well, locked me in the meat shed downstairs. That's where I saw the fresh blood, I'm sure Jessie was there before me. So, how did you escape the meat shed? Oh, he let me out. He needed me to cook for him. But the steaks... I told you about the steaks. I just thought if I stayed alive, well, then maybe Jessie stayed alive and If I... cooked the steak and I cooked with all my love for her, well, then maybe I could help her. [Maria]But... But the...the steaks. He said they were... He said the-the meat... [Maria]He said the meat-- -Here. Can I... -Well, thank you. -You should rest it. [Medic]In fact , you should probably go to the hospital. Piet. He made me cook it. Well, excellent pieces of meat down there but why would he make you cook aardvark? Aardvark? Yeah, I can bet my life on it. [Piet]My dad used to hunt these and cook them for us. But he said the-the meat, he said that, he-he said it was-- No, I promise you. It's aardvark meat and nothing else. Okay? Okay. We need to search for Jessie, what do you have happening in the way of a search party? There's a small team there, there's another one on the way. You should go home, get dry, and keep out of harms way. Okay? I'm not going home. I want to search for Jessie with you. Okay, then keep warm. Okay. Warm. Warm. [tense music] Let's go. I thought you'd like to know that your friend Van Wyk is a murderer. He killed Martine Burger. He killed Lawrence Khubeka. He tried to kill Maria Purvis. And now he's kidnapped Jessie September. So unless you want everyone to think that you knew all along that he was a murderer, you need to do some quick PR for yourself and get everyone you know to come and help us look for her. I trust once that you'll do the right thing. [tense music] [car door slams] Umm...hey, Regardt I meant to ask about my, my cattle friends. Umm...one...dead. Arab. I'm very grateful to ya. I think they're just about done in the cabin. I'm trying to get them to stay to join the search. [engine rumbling] How can we help? Thank you for coming. We'll find her. Okay? We will. Over here guys, I'll give you instructions! [music continues] And? What exactly is happening here? We just wanted to go look for Jessie. And you thought it would be clever to sneak out? It's not enough one of my children is missing, the two of you want to give me heart attacks by disappearing too? [both] Sorry, ma. [sighs] Okay. I'll call my church group, Bronwyn, you message your dance team, and Riley, you go next door and tell auntie we need help. And Bronwyn, you're gonna need proper shoes, not those fashion shoes of yours and we all need our warm jackets. Come on! Hurry up! [soft music] [engine rumbling] [engine rumbling] -Hi, how can we help? -Let's go this way. Come through. Come through. Go on. You can go. Thank you. Thanks. Ms. September, I'm sorry, we haven't been able to find her yet. Let's go find our girl. I found something! It's a pocket knife with blood! Keep looking! She's still alive! Let's go find our girl. [tense music] Twenty four hours. Jessie said if you don't find a missing person within twenty four hours, they're probably dead. Aren't you going to tell me that's not true? No. See, all she did was go to a bar with her friends. You don't wanna hear that now. Oh, no, please. I'm... Tell me anything. She went out with her friends for a weekend. [soft music] And that whole weekend I was trying to believe that it was something else. Anything else. There was a moment where she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and somebody decided that... her life was worth less than a cell phone. I'm so sorry. And then Khazi... I tried my best. And I often think that you know, if her mother stayed home, or if she went to a different bar maybe Khazi would be happier, and kinder. [music continues] So yeah, we found her body after two days. So I'm not gonna tell you that isn't true. And I'm going to hope like hell that is not the same for Jessie. You need a good soup. [mellow music] Just start with a whole load of sweet potatoes. [gasps] Or regular potatoes if you're already feeling sweet enough. And you cut them in quarters, and then you quarter them again. Are you praying? [chuckles] Close enough. It's my mother's vegetable soup recipe. You add butternut... [Maria]and bell peppers and green beans, cauliflower and spinach, and you sauté in a wee bit of oil, with a pinch of salt. [music continues] [water splatters] And you make sure that the vegetables... soften up, and then you add freshly minced garlic. [Maria sniffles] [Maria]You have to wake the flavour up and then its time for your secret ingredient. Curry powder. Jess-Jessie. J-Jessie! She's over here! Here. [breathing heavily] Jessie, I'm here. It's okay. -Aright. Okay. [Ms. September]J-Jessie! [crying] Jess! No. Jessie. [Ms September breathing heavily] Oh, it's very faint. She lost a lot of blood. Get the medics down here now! [crying] Oh, she is...my girl. I'm so glad I didn't cook you. [laughs] [Medic]Come on, guys, let's get a move on. [indistinct chatter] [Ms. September]It's gonna be okay, baby. That arrow was awfully close to her heart. Yeah. Let's get you home. Is it wrong, I am really glad he's dead? No, it's not wrong. If anyone was going to die today, I'm grateful it was him. Will Jessie be okay? I don't know. But she's in the best hands. -Lets go home. -I need to go to the hospital. [tense music] [siren wailing] Get the doors open. She's lost a lot of blood, and pulse is very weak, we almost lost her a few times-- I'll take it from here. Thank you. But she's about to transfusion-- I'll take care of her. Come, get her out of here. [indistinct chatter] [music continues] [ducks quacking] [door opens] Maria. Maria, tea... [sniffs] [Mickey]Maria! ["Stay With me" by Lorraine Ellison playing on radio] Hmm.

[soft music] [music continues] You can see her now. She's awake. Oh, thank goodness. [music continues] Detective, we're ready to redress your wound. Okay. Maria. Is it true? The filthy bastard's dead? [sighs] I always knew you were made of steel. [chuckles] I'm so glad Martine had you to fight for her. [sighs] [sniffles] Dirk still killed her. If she hadn't needed to leave him, she would never have started blackmailing that dime store psychopath. And Uncle Peter killed her too. With his goddamn miserliness. I hope Jessie blames them all in her exposé. They just have to operate first. Remove an arrow. Jessie's not gonna let a small thing like an arrow stop her blaze of glory. [titters] [groans] I'll let Grace know that we found the killer. And Dirk. Ah, thanks. But you must go home first, man. Let Michelle fuss over you a bit. You should come for supper. I will. But for now... Thank you, detective. [sighs] Can I take you home? Yes. Yes, please. [mellow music] [car door shuts] [music continues] Ooh. [chuckles] She's here. [laughing/sniffles] I love you too. [soft music] I need a...a bath. You are just a little girl, and I lean so hard on you. [Ms. September]So unfair. I'm sorry, Jess. [knock on door] [sighs] [soft music] Oh, thank you. How is she? Surgery go okay? [Ms. September]She's asleep, thank goodness. Doctor says everything is stitched up nice and clean. But we're still not sure how much blood she's lost. [Hattie]Oh, well. When she wakes up... there's a story she wrote last week that I didn't run. I was wrong, Jessie was right. Thank you, Hattie. [music continues] I'll come back a little later. -She'd like that. -Hmm. [cell door opening] [Peit]Mr Burger... We must inform you, we know who killed your wife. It was Cornel Van Wyk. Her boss? Yes. She was blackmailing him. She needed the money, so she could... So she could leave me.

Is my head broken too? Your head's too strong to be broken. [chuckles] Bruised a little, maybe. Actually, you know what? I'm starving. [sobbing] Oh. What! Am I not allowed food now? [chuckles] Of course you are. [sniffles] I just have to check with the doctor first. [laughing] I need to call the hospital. Just spoke to them and Jessie's absolutely fine. The arrow's out, the bone is set. -And she's eating. -Oh, great. Good. Thank you. Well, teabag was in for three minutes, one sugar and dash of cold milk. [soft music] Right, well, um, I know what I need to do next. Luckily I have got so many sweet potatoes! Well, we're all safe if you're safe, Jess. [Ms. September]Its wonderful to have Jess back, but we're going to be doing a few things differently at home. Hmm? Jessie needs time for her work. It's important. I couldn't agree more. There's an expose on Van Wyk to be written, and the national papers are calling me asking when to expect it. From me? Nobody could write it better. [music continues] [chopping] Are you making brunch? I'm making soup for Jessie! She needs it! Could you get me some parsley? Sure. It's amazing. [music continues] Your face. [giggles] It's just a face. It is the best face. Thank you. If you don't have fresh tomatoes, you can just cook them out a few minutes longer. Just get rid of their tinniness. Here. -Taste. -Thank you. You add a few bay leafs... and more salt. [music continues] It's delicious. You build up the flavour gradually. The very best soup has golden droplets of fat on the top. Aren't you gorgeous?! [sighs] [door opens] [Hattie]Oh. Thank you for your help earlier. Oh, I'm just glad she was found alive. If we hadn't had a decent sized search party she may never have been. About your article this morning. I'm surprised you had time to read it, what with all the drama and excitement. I assume it was a sympathetic showing for your journalist. I'm afraid, Marius, I will no longer be taking editorial feedback from you. If you want to reach my readers, I'd be delighted to carry your ads. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a great deal of work I need to finish. [footsteps receding] [door closes] [scoff] Well, at least he's not a murderer. [chair squeaking] I'm so tired.

Ms. Purvis here has been a victim-- [Maria] It's okay. They've come a long way. I recognised the house. You know, from the pictures. Gosh, Maria. You look so different. [chuckles] A lot has happened. You'd better come in. Uh... I should leave you all to the family business? I think that's best. Thank you. Go on ahead, I'll-I'll, I'll follow you. Khaya. [sighs] Thank you. [soft music] [car door opens] [car door shuts] [car ignition] How about a lovely bowl of soup? [tense music] [music continues]
