Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- EPISODE 6 Go on, Omar, help me understand. How do you know Sahar? Who's Sahar? The one helping your brother buy a house? Yes, that's the one, indeed. How do you know her? Why are you mad? Did something happen? Is something wrong? -Basil is attracted to her. -What's wrong with that? Sahar is cute and respectful. The problem is that I had an affair with her in Turkey. Do you understand that it's a problem? Sahar? God give you strength. Send my regards to Abdo, and may he get well soon. -Thank you. Pardon me, mistress. -God be with you. So, did you like it? Not bad. I feel that this house is full of positive vibes. But in my opinion, the first house is much better. That's my opinion too, but I can't wait for two months. Sorry. Are there any problems with your brother putting you in a hurry? Not at all. He wants me to stay at his house. Okay, then, you can wait for some time. I can deliver in less than two months. You're buying the house of a lifetime. It'd be sad to buy a house that you're not really convinced by. Is that your opinion? In the end, it's your decision... but yes, that's my opinion. Deal, then. I'll wait for two months. Start with the procedures. Deal. Not yet. Did you forget that I wanted your opinion in the car? With pleasure. What else, Mr. Basil? I'd like to invite you to dinner today. -It seems you're really greedy. -A little more than usual. What's your answer? It depends on the dinner. If it's a business dinner, then I agree. If it's not a business dinner, and if I'd like to know you better and be closer to you, what would be your answer? I don't advise you. Really? Why? Because it's better to get to know some people from afar. To not get close. They're prettier from afar. Shall we? I can't believe it! Of all women, my brother gets attracted to Sahar. The only girl he likes after Nour... is one I've had an affair with. What will I tell him? Omar, what will I tell him, seriously? You know Basil's emotional case. If he knows, what may happen to him? In my opinion, don't tell him anything. She, herself, will put an end to it. Moreover, Sahar eliminated love from her life when her fiancé died. Hold on a minute. I'm reconsidering everything. In Turkey, she told me that she never fell in love. She'll have kept things from you, obviously. She won't have told you her life story and love history in three days. There's something wrong. There's something fishy in my opinion. -I don't understand. What do you mean? -I don't know. I really don't know. I have to tell him without knowing what his reaction might be. We've been talking about your brother for an hour, but don't forget about your wife's reaction. If Basil knows, Reem will know for sure. You have to think about it very well. This could ruin your life. I can't believe that a mistake could ruin my whole life. As well as my brother's life. How can I look him in the eye now? Or my wife? What a disaster! What a disaster! What a disaster it is! -Hello. -My love. Is my timing wrong? Not at all, we were talking business. -How are you, Reem? -I am fine. -Pardon me. -Goodbye. -What do you have here? -Pizza, as you like it. Why are you mad? Nothing important. Some problems at work. Aren't you hungry? I'm very hungry. Let's eat. So, have you finished the paperwork? Yes, don't worry. When Mahmoud arrives, we'll leave. What did all this cost us? What do you care? Anyways, Mahmoud covered it all. Mahmoud? Where did he get the money? From Abdallah, may God help him. There is no power but from God. Was it necessary to bring me to hospital? -Let me go. -Would we let you die? What are we without you? Why do I need to live? You'll be relieved if I die. Stop saying that. I'll go out to use someone's phone to call Mahmoud and check where he is. -Hello? -Hello, my dearest. So, what happened? Did you fix the device? No, Mom, not yet. It can't be fixed. -We have to get another one. -My God. How much does it cost? I only have 120 thousand, the hospital wants 260 thousand. My dearest, are you okay? -Why is your voice broken? -No, Mom, all is good. Don't worry, I'll manage. I'll get a new device and get to you. Bye, Mom. Bye. Do you think the car papers will be ready by tonight so that we can have dinner? Do you still insist on the dinner? Of course, I do. You know why? After all what we've been through, you and I, I feel God has put us together for a reason. By the way, God doesn't send us the person that we want. He sends us the people we need... sometimes for them to love us because we need love, and sometimes for them to break us because we need to harden and learn. I don't want to break you. Okay. Isn't it possible that God put us together for the first reason? Honestly, I don't know how to love. You didn't love your fiancé? Basil, my fiancé didn't commit suicide. It's my mother who committed suicide. I wasn't engaged anyways. I never fell in love. I used this excuse with Omar to keep him away from me. I keep using it with any man who tries to get close to me. Why did you tell me the truth? Why didn't you continue with the lie to keep me away? Sahar. Sahar, look at me. I'll tell you why. Deep down... you don't want to move away. You didn't seem to like it. Yes, it's delicious, maybe a bit cold. You should have seen the traffic on the roads today. It took me an hour to get here. What's bothering you? There's nothing, my love. I've already told you. Just some problems at work. Do you swear? Transfer it. An important phone call. Anyway, I'll leave. I'm late. -Bye. -Bye. Later, Sonia. Later. Mrs. Reem, can we have a word privately? -What about? -Hi. -Welcome. -What are you doing here? I came to have lunch with Hady, but I'm leaving for the dentist now. -Okay. -See you. -Bye. -God be with you. I need to thank you. -Why? -Because you introduced me to Sahar. Hold on one moment. I just want to understand. How come there's 15-percent benefit? I've bet on five percent, and maybe that won't be beneficial. No one pays that percentage out of his own pocket unless he wants to cheat with the material. Okay, okay. I'll recheck the bid and we'll go into the details. How are you? I'm really okay. For the first time, I feel like I'm really fine. -Tell me, have you found a house? -Yes. But you'll have to bear with me for two more months until the sale. If I had my say, I wouldn't let you go, but you're insisting. It's okay. It's better for us both. Tell me, what are some new restaurants in Beirut? -I'm inviting Sahar to dinner tonight. -Right away? You were the one who told me not to hesitate, so I'm taking your advice. Yes, indeed, I told you not to hesitate. But quite honestly, I've reconsidered what I've said. I've found out that this girl isn't right for you. She'll be a headache. A headache? How come? The story of her dead fiancé, which is still affecting her. -That turned out to be a lie. -What do you mean? She lied to you? She lied to Omar about that so she could keep him away from her. Now, tell me about some good restaurants. Basil, there's something... I need to tell you. What is it? Honestly, I don't know how to start. Hady, talk. You're worrying me. What's happening? Basil, come on, your office is ready. Have you arranged everything that quickly? Your brother didn't believe that you'd be working with him. Let's go. I want to talk with Hady for two minutes. Do you mind? You didn't tell him yet? Tell me what? There's a project in Dubai and he wants you to handle it. In Dubai? What are you saying here? Surely not. You see? I told you he wouldn't accept. -We'll talk about it. -Dubai, he says. God bless you. You're a dear sister, Hanane. -God bless you. -You too. Thank God he got better, Um Mahmoud. Thank you, Abdallah, and I appreciate all that you've done. -This is the least we can do. -God protect you. -Welcome back, Abu Mahmoud. -Thank you, Abdallah. -It's good that he got better, Mahmoud. -God bless you, dear. Welcome back. Happy for you, my dear Mahmoud. -Welcome back, Abu Mahmoud. -Thank you. Welcome back, we're happy. -Thank you, thank you. -Thank you. May God help us, Abdallah, so we can compensate you. We're one family. We're neighbors, so don't go saying that. -Come in, come in. -I'll close the store and come right away. -Welcome back. -Watch your step. -Welcome back. -Slowly, slowly. -Well done. -Welcome back. -Get in. -I'll help. -Hey, Abdallah? -Yes? What's wrong with Abu Mahmoud? He was at hospital. A minor setback, but he's better now. And you didn't tell me? Had I seen you, I would've told you, but I haven't. Are these vegetables fresh? Half are fresh, and the other half will be returned tomorrow. Hello, people. What brought you here? What a question! As usual, I'm here to get my pay. If you're interested, I started paying in cash. You don't get a pay here. Go get it elsewhere, or I swear, Jaber, I'll bury you right here. Come on, old man, is that how you talk to a fellow? I'm one of you. You're not one of us, and you don't mean anything to us. I swear, I'll beat you to death if you don't leave right now. Don't touch me! I'll do what you want, old man. Mr. Jaber? Mr. Jaber? -I'm coming, I'm coming. -Go, just leave. Don't touch me! Abdallah, where is that Jaber getting all of the money? Money? And why does he want to buy this neighborhood? It's a project. They want to buy this neighborhood, including all the apartments and houses, to build big buildings. So, you said you don't need these? No, take them. God be with you, enjoy. Anyways, if they had been fresh, you'd had sold them. Okay. -Good night. -God be with you. This whole neighborhood needs to be demolished. Yes, you want that because you didn't work on building it. If the guy pays you double the price for your apartment, you'll be sad? At least we could buy an apartment in a good neighborhood. Not a poor neighborhood like this one. You were raised in this poor neighborhood. You have your memories and childhood here. All my childhood and memories are worthless. Wouldn't it be better if you had a shower instead of putting on all that deodorant? It's perfume, and it's required for work. You're so ignorant. I can't breathe. By the way, I don't like all this work. When I come back in the evening with loads of money, you'll like it. -Go away, move. -See you. Lamees? Lamees? -Yes, Mom? -Put the heater on. -I want to take a shower. -Okay. Bring the eggplants with you. May God punish you, Abu Toufic, for these five amperes. Lamees? Lamees, turn the heater off and go push the button up. What are you thinking about? Dinner is ready. Don't you want to eat? I don't feel like eating, my love. You didn't have lunch, and now you don't want to eat. -What's the problem? -Nothing. Tell me, how elegant do I look? You're really elegant. Tell me, which is better? Like this? Or should I open the vest? Keep it open. -Great. -This is good. -Thank you. -Where are you going? I'm going to have dinner with Sahar. The girl you met is Sahar? Yes. Why are you surprised? Nothing, but it's a pretty name. Not just her name. Everything about her is pretty. She's here. Come look at her, but don't let her see you. I'm going to bed. My love? Do you know Sahar? No, I don't. Why would I know her? I mean, didn't you see her with Basil? Yes, I saw her. When she came this morning to go see the house. So, you talked to her? I didn't talk to her. I saw her from a distance. So, Basil didn't introduce you to each other? No, he didn't, and I don't know her. Why all the questions? I just wanted to know your opinion about her. What would my opinion be? I don't understand. God bless you, Abu Mahmoud. Tomorrow, you'll be walking up and down the neighborhood. I forgot, is it on diesel or gas? It's environmentally friendly. It's electric. What would you do if the electricity went off? We didn't think about that. Mahmoud? -Mahmoud? -Yes, Mom? -Are you okay, my dear? -Yes, I'm fine. My son, this machine functions on electricity only? Yes, Dad, but they promised to get me another one like the old one. You can use it when the electricity goes off and when you go out. I told you, you'll be walking up and down the neighborhood. Hopefully. -It's always a pleasure to be with you. -Stay, it's early. -No, that's okay, I'll help you here. -I won't accept. -No, no. -I won't accept, leave it. -You leave that, you're tired enough. -I won't accept. -God! -You're welcome. -I'm like your sister. -You're very dear. -Why are you coming with me? -It's a pleasure. I'm not a stranger, my dear, I'm always here. You're always welcome. May God protect Mahmoud. The machine is great, indeed. -May God bless you. -What a relief! -Mister. -Yes? I'll pass by your store tomorrow hopefully. I'll pay what's due and the amount for the hospital. Mahmoud, my dear, who is talking about any money? -The money is ready, believe me. -My dear son. -Have a good night. -God be with you. Same to you, God bless you. My dear, call me for anything you need, even at midnight. Who else do I have in this neighborhood? -Good night, my dear. -Goodbye. God be with you. My dear, where did you get all the money to pay what's due? I got them from a friend of mine. -Who's he? -You don't know him, Mom. May God bless him and be pleased with him. And you, my dear. May God keep him for his parents. Do you feel like this machine is better, pumping more oxygen? -Thank God. -Thank God. May God bless him. Let me help you. -You've always been courteous. -God bless you. -Good night. -Hanane. -Yes? -May God bless you. But how long until you and I are like that? Rasheed will get married soon. You and I have gotten to the last phase of our lives. -Good night. -Same to you. Hello, young man. Where have you been, son? -How's Abu Mahmoud? -I'm asking where you've been. -Under Lamees's window. -Lamees. Listen, you won't stand still until Sariah gets hold of you and kills you. I'm dying to marry her, but I don't know how. Didn't I tell you that I have the solution? -I have the solution. -How is this problem solved? My son, calm down and relax. I told you a few days ago that I can solve it. -Yes. -And I am looking for a solution. Now, I found it. -What's the solution? -I won't tell you. Go rest and sleep. -Please, tell me. -I won't tell you. I'll peel your beard now. Just go and rest. The great head! Damn, this luck! -Your glass. -Thanks, beautiful. -How pretty! -What's new? -This is not my lucky night, Raouf. -Not mine either. So? How are the good guys doing? Is everything okay? So, Amir, who've you got your eye on tonight? The left or the right? On the losers. Believe me, it's impossible for you to lose with Sousou. She is a very good piece, believe me. -Sousou, take care of the good guys. -As you wish. My dear, pardon me. Damn you! Take him and sit him down. He'll get tired standing up. Move! -Welcome! Welcome, Mr. Jaber. -Hello. How are you? You have a very hard heart. This is not acceptable. Why aren't we seeing you? -Did you miss me? -Not as much as Fifi. Where is she? Fifi is doing great now, one client coming in, another one coming out. She is unstoppable now. Where would she be in your opinion? She's with a client. Make him leave, and get me a table ready. Give me five minutes because he's really rich. -Make him leave. -Okay, as you wish, dear, calm down. Girls, get a table ready for Mr. Jaber, quickly. Mr. Jaber. Mr. Amine. What brings you here? The same thing that brings you here. Get up. Let's play on my table. They're getting it ready for me. I would have liked that, but I lost all my money. Shame on you! I'm here, and you say you don't have money? We're one family and neighbors! Or have you forgotten? How could I forget? You're the talk of the neighborhood. Saying good things about me, I hope. All is good. Half, half. Those who want to sell are wishing you well. -Those who don't want to sell... -Are cursing me. Indeed. Those people are idiotic and narrow-minded. Instead of being happy I'm paying them a price they'd never dream of... Instead of thanking me for demolishing the misery they live in in order to rebuild it... Believe me, I said the same thing to my wife. You're a loyal person, Amine. Follow me to the room. I'll be waiting. Don't be late. I'll be waiting for you at my table. Say something, man. You're paying all this money for nothing. At least tell me something. Solitude is hard, Fifi. It's very hard, and I come to you to rest. But anyway, yes, we can talk. Tell me something, go on. Should I be saying something, or should you? No. I've got nothing to tell you today. I want you to tell me something. What's your real name? My name reflects my appearance. Fadileh. Yes, see how cute you are when you laugh and relax. But I'm kidding. Talk. I'm listening. My name is Farah. But believe me, from the day I was born, I've never seen one day of happiness. But it's okay, it'll pass. Tell me your story. That way, I should be paying you, and I don't have a single penny. You're forgiven. I don't want anything from you. Nothing at all? That's impossible. I'm not used to doing anything for free. -Who is it? -Come on, just open. Your Rambo is outside. Get rid of this one fast. You have to leave. Why is that? There's a client waiting and I have to see him. But I paid Yvonne for you to be only mine. Yes, but that client is special, and we can't say no. He'll take "no" for an answer. -I'll talk to her. -No, Omar, please leave. Why? Because this client is my husband. Your glass is still full. You going to let me drink alone? No, I'll drink with you. I have one condition. -What condition? -You tell me. What will I tell you about? About you. I'd like to know everything about you. Your childhood till now. You've gone too far. Really? Why? Because I lived a childhood I wouldn't like to remember. I lived an ugly childhood. One that was cruel and painful. Violated. Let's change the subject. I don't like talking about my childhood. It bothers me. I'm sorry. I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. What if we talked about the future? But the past was better. Let's stay in it. So we only have the present. What if we talk about that? That's perfect. Let's talk about that. Tell me. At the moment, I'm having dinner with a man... who would like to know everything about me. And I'd like to tell him everything, but I'm afraid. -Are you afraid of him? -I'm scared for him. Everything about me hurts. I don't want him to feel bad. -Then, try him, maybe he's strong. -He's not strong. He pretends to be strong. But deep inside, he's not strong. It seems you know this guy pretty well. I know him because he looks like me. He wears the mask of strength... but deep inside, he's a small boy. Tell me about this man, then. What do you think of him? He's cute. Calm. But the problem is that he is good-hearted. Is a good heart a problem nowadays? Nowadays, yes, because a good heart is considered idiotic, while malice has become a sign of intelligence. You seem to have suffered many evil acts in your life, and that's why you're so resentful. I'm not resentful. But I don't trust anyone. But not all people are the same. Do you see that you're good-hearted? Never trust anyone. Everyone can betray you when they get the chance. Jiha gave me the money. Jiha took it as well. What can I do if you don't know how to play? I play very well, but there's no luck. Unlike you. You're very lucky. Look at how you moved on upward. That's not called luck, Amine. It's called cunning. It means you have to profit from the situation. I've never gotten to do that. That is because you're not cunning and you don't take risks. If you don't take risks, Amine, nothing will ever change. No one is a loser with me. Don't forget what we talked about. He really is a lucky guy. How's my sweet wife? Why are you looking at me like that? I just want to thank you. -What for? -For everything. Good night. Good night. Sahar? I've been waiting for your visit for a long time. I'm still waiting for you to talk. I know that it's hard on you to come here to see me. To the neighborhood where you were born and raised. You mean to the neighborhood where I died a hundred times. Let's forget about the past. Let's concentrate on the present. The past got me where I am today. It made me Sahar... who you're not satisfied with for sure. No, it's not the past that got you here. It was I who, after what happened, took care of you and took you to the orphanage, where I thought you'd learn and change your life. You have refused that. You have escaped and taken Reem with you. I wanted to be free. I wanted to taste the taste of freedom, which I'd never felt. I didn't want to escape from my father's prison to another prison. The orphanage is not a prison. The life that you've lived with Reem after your escape from the orphanage, that was the prison. You slept on the roads, under the bridges. You used to steal and beg. You sold flowers. You sold yourselves as well. Is that freedom? Taking advantage of rich men? One of you gets a civil marriage, and the second sets a trap, so he betrays his wife... and then you file for a divorce... ripping him off for half his fortune. Is that freedom? This is injustice. I was sure that Reem's visit to you was not useless. I was sure she was telling you everything. Why aren't you looking at me? Are you looking down because you're ashamed of me or of yourself? I'm not ashamed at all... because that is me. Sahar. I've chosen to be like this, and I don't regret it at all. You don't regret it? Don't you regret that you're stealing money from men? -This is not fair. -Why? If we take money from very rich people, where's the problem in that? It's not called injustice. It's justice. We aren't being unfair to men. They are being unfair to themselves when they betray. That's how you convince yourself. -You're convinced that this is injustice. -Isn't poverty an injustice? Some people have everything while we don't have enough to eat. Isn't that injustice? Some people wrap their children in garbage bags, like with Reem, and throw them at the orphanage door. Isn't that injustice? Having my dad take me down to the streets to wipe car windows instead of being a child at school? Isn't that injustice? And having my dad rape me repeatedly, having my mom kill him and then herself? Is that injustice or not?
