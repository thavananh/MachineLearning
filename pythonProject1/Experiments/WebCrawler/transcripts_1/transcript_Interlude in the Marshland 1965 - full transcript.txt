We have to get going! What the hell are you dawdling for? I'm staying, lads. We're leaving now, Allan. Come on! The brakes have been loosened. You can go. Hi. What in God's name are you doing here, man? Aren't you supposed to be on board? Nope, I think I'll stay. You must be losing it. What in the name of Christ will you do here? I'll be staying for a while. But you'll be reported. Can't be helped. My name is Kvist. And I have quit. They may report it as much as they like. But Jesus Christ! Do you realize what you're doing? You're ruining your future. Yes, a brakeman can become whatever he wants. Even a stationmaster. If he knows how to behave, that is. But to just get out like this? Being tired of the government, it's — And being reported, it's — Could I please have a glass of water? You'll have to use the ladle. What beautiful plants you have, ma'am. And what chubby, beautiful children. It's a hot day. We might get a thunderstorm. It's hot. Why did you get off the train here? It's not right. You"ll have to admit as much. What if I left my post like that? - The world would probably end. - But here? Why here? - Well, it's beautiful here. There is nothing here. No roads, nothing! Well. - Nowhere to live. - No. If you're tired of the government you could have resigned like anyone else would have done. Or do you plan to apply for a job up at the quarry? It's three kilometers from here. Is it always this beautiful here? Beautiful? It's a mosquito-filled hellhole. Could I please have a ladle of water? Out basking in the sun, are we? Well, it would be a pity if no one enjoyed the beautiful weather, now, wouldn't it? So, on your way to get a job at the quarry, I suppose? Now, that's an idea. Is it terribly high up, the Stenberg? Well... no doubt. Yeah, it's all that's needed. Needed? Well, true. You mean the horses, the ones to pull down the stone from up there. No, I'm talking about the view. It's damn beautiful here. Well, it's better in the winter. In the summer we have to change the crossties. In the winter there isn't much to do. And we get additional pay on account of the cold. Do you have many children? I've been here for eight years. Before, I wasn't married. I worked as a brakeman. Long ago. Well, children are great fun. If you're looking for a job at the quarry, the boss won't be in until Saturday. Oh, well. Actually, I do have other business in mind. Ah, there's a gal somewhere. I guess you can sleep in the barrack. But you have to let them search your hair. You understand. People have been known to bring vermin with them. Do you think they would lend me a iron rod? Are you looking for gold here? There is no gold around here. I know that for sure. Is there gold up here? I'd need an iron rod. Do you think there's one at the quarry I could use? You can borrow one of mine. In that case I don't need to climb all the way up the mountain. That's really kind of you. I'll be back in an hour or so. I can go with you. No need. Watch it! What? What? Keep away when it comes. Keep what away? How? The rock! You're mad! Mad! You should be arrested! But I will have my rod back! I'll be down with the rod. Wait! There will be a lot of children... here in the loneliness. Children are so much fun. It's hot. Beautiful plants.
