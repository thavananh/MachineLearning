Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- [Tannie]Previously on Recipes for Love and Murder. We have to find the killer. First Martine, and now Lawrence. I've already asked you and your friend to keep out of police business. Deserves a professional investigation into her death. So does Lawrence Kubeka. And that's my job. Not yours. [Tannie]And there you have it. A cake that can win over even your worst enemy. Bet you can't even fire that thing. -Left middle toe. -Ah! [groaning] Oh! Would they like some cake? I'm sorry, we can't. We're vegan. My wife just meant that because of our religion we are vegan. You calling because you need cash. You know I wouldn't ask unless it was actually gonna help with my marks. Who's your socialist colleague? You ask a lot of questions. She's a reporter, that's her job. She's trying to solve Martine's murder. We're not stopping until we solve this. The, uh, committee elections are coming up very soon, I... I was wondering if perhaps you might consider running for secretary? A cop here? Many gold four-by-four's are there in this time. Your life is in danger. Please keep out of this business. No one needs your meddling. Still no sign of Anna. Nobody's seen nothin'? [instrumental music] She left about an hour ago. And you're sure she was looking for Dirk? That's what she said. I mean, I didn't want to question her any further, seeing as she gave us quite a gunshow the last time she was here. Do you wanna come in for some coffee? Sorry, we need to run. Of course, duty calls! -Thank you though! Thank you. -Bye. [intriguing music] [exhales] [exhales] [gunshot] [theme music] [music continues] [Khazi]I'm not available. You know what to do. Lollipop, it's dad. Please call me, I'm starting to worry about you. I was expecting you here by now. [intense music] [gunshots] -Anna! Anna! -Dirk! -Anna! -Dirk! [gunshot] -Hello, Tannie. Hello, Jess. -Hey. -Hey. Do you want a drink? -No. -For Martine? -No, thank you. -I'm good. -It's pomegranate juice. The police are looking for you. Have they found Tienie's killer? -Not yet. -He, see, Dirk, I told you. -Police are bloody useless. -They're useless. We're going to find him. And then we're going... [gunshots] -Did you buy this at the Koop? -Yes. And it's definitely pomegranate juice? With vodka. [Dirk]Fokken useless cops. [gunshot] Of course I'm busy with it now. Okay, I'll ask him. [whistles] Oye! Hey, Regardt. Did anybody come in this morning? A woman about my height, stunning? -A suspect? -No, the boss's daughter. -Uh-uh. -Nah, sorry, Boss. You're gonna bring her to dinner tonight, won't you? The girls are gonna kill me if you don't. Oh, and don't forget about the game at lunchtime. The boss has a daughter? Hey, we all have daughters, bro, except you. [instrumental music] [gunshots] Um, Dirk...would you mind if we had a look inside the house to see if the police missed anything? It's open, you can knock yourselves out! -Mm-hm. -Thank you. Fuckin' police! [gunshots] [soft music] Are we sure this isn't just a long bluff from Anna? Get him drunk and then shoot him? It would be a boss move. Make it look like an accident? Or self defence? I mean, Dirk's pretty easy to frame. I should call Regardt and tell him Anna's here. Just wait a minute, Jess. Let's think. Anna bought this pomegranate juice at the Koop, yes. I'm not entirely sure she bought it the day Martine died. But didn't the cashier say she did? Well, yes, but maybe she was just trying to be helpful? Maybe she just had a memory of another time Anna bought the juice and she just... Like she mixed up the days. We know she didn't kill Lawrence. Yeah, and it's even more unlikely that there are two murderers than one. [suspenseful music] Ugh! Men. [exhales] Are you okay Tannie M? I just feel like I'm failing her. Maybe mutton curry was never the answer. It's what she needed. You gave her what she needed. Come and see me again in a month then. Thank you doctor. Let's go on, then. I'm worried that your husband isn't listening to me. Please can you help him watch his diet? He got really lucky last time. I understand. Thank you, doctor. [string music] So, it was like a sort of target practice and grief bonding session? Mm-hm. Honestly it's difficult to imagine what Martine ever saw in him. Sometimes there's not a lot of choice in small towns. I've had plenty of experiences with small town men. And believe me, nobody needs to settle for Dirk Burger! [grunting] Don't worry, Anna. -We're gonna get him. -Yeah, Dirk, you just rest. Hello, detective? It's Anna. Anna Pretorius. Listen, I thought I'd just give you a call to tell you you're a shit policeman. You're very, very useless. [knocks on door] Hello, Anna? It's been two weeks, detective. Two weeks. A hamster can make a whole baby hamster in two weeks. Anna? And you detective, have done nothing at all in two weeks, except harass and victimise me. But I loved her! I loved Tienie! [Regardt]Anna? Please open the door! Come on, let me in. Hello? [gunshot] Come in. It's open. [dramatic music] [instrumental music] I can't believe that not even a multiple homicide investigation delays the local rugby match. The local boere, they just love the opportunity to put the cops back in their place. Can't let them down. Hey, Piet, did you look into the money angle? No, we're still waiting to hear back from the bank. It can't be coincidence, the timing those small deposits into her account. It could be a loan from her dad. No, Candy was adamant that she didn't get anything from her dad. So why don't you ask her? Huh? Oh, my interest in Candy is purely professional. Whatever. If you say so. Mm. [scowls] No recipes spring to mind for that? Heavens no, it's clearly someone in need of a financial advisor or an alibi for tax fraud, anyway. Definitely not one for me. What about you, what are you busy with? I've been trying to find out more about Marius Rabie. I've pulled up records of all the properties he's bought in the area in the past few months. Please, Jess, be careful. I know, I know, we need his ad money. Mm. It's not just that. He's a nasty, dangerous man and I don't trust him. [phone rings] Hello? What is it? Umm, yeah, sure, yeah, I'll come through. Okay. Okay, bye. -Weird. -What? My cousin that works at the Koop, wants to talk about Martine. -What about her? -He didn't say. That's why I'm going over there. Coming with, partner? Umm. Well, just tell me what he said. I-I actually do need to find a letter for a column. Yeah. [phone rings] Hi, ma. Yeah, I can fetch Browyn. So rude for changing your shift. They don't respect you, honestly. Okay, ma, I'll see you later. [door bell jingles] Detective. Good to see that you're also playing. I didn't think rugby wasn't your game. I haven't played since matric, Piet insisted that the team needed me. Very public spirited of you. Is everything sorted out with Anna and Dirk? Something like that, sir. ♪ I see through you ♪ [laughs] Oh, my gosh! We need to take a snap. -Mm! -Ooh! My dad, dude. Okay. [laughs] Dear Tannie Maria. When it comes down to it, what do you think is more important? Love? Or duty? Or God? My husband is a loving man, and a great father, and a hard worker. Hi, you're welcome. [Georgie]But I'm finding all the rules really tiring. There's no jewellery. No dancing. No women pastors. And no animal products. I wish my husband would be a little more flexible. I'm starting to find life a little joyless, and I can't imagine raising my daughter in this religion. Am I being unreasonable? Yours, A Devout Devotee. Hattie, what would you give up for a man? Me? Nothing. Been there done that. Why? Did somebody make you an offer you can't refuse? I'll have to bake her the feather lightest cake ever to help lift her spirits. Sounds heavenly. Oh, Doep does have a special on venison. I'm not putting venison in a vegan cake Hattie, not even for you. Well, it starts with a V! [chuckling] [doorbell dinging] [suspenseful music] What? What do you want? Oh, just to get out. I need a drink, man. Listen, did I teel you the venison is on special this week? And the ostrich is fly off the shelf, girl. -Got it. -Okay, bye. [car engine revving] I can't believe you made me carry that thing on my back the whole way home! Well I could hardly carry it with you sitting behind me, could I? Since when did you play guitar though? I don't. Jess, you haven't stopped frowning the whole day. What's wrong? If Regardt's being an asshole again just say the word, I'm ready. No, no, Regardt's being lovely. It's just this whole investigation. I feel like I'm missing something really obvious. You know Bron, like, if I turn my head fast enough I'll catch sight of it. Ma always says if we're missing something we should retrace our steps. [intriguing music] Bronnie I need to go, Tannie Ellen is going to drop Riley an hour. See you later! Is the Detective here? I'm afraid not, can I help you? Oh. What about Piet, is Piet here? -They're all out, Tannie. -All? It's the rugby. You know, the cops, firemen, doctors versus the local businessmen. It's supposed to boost morale and make people excited about living in Eden. In the middle of a multiple homicide investigation? I believe the detective did raise that concern, but apparently it's not good PR to cancel the match. 'Cause everybody's already so excited for it. I see. So can I help you, Tannie? What would you do if you thought someone was following you? Arrest them. [sighs] You know what? Take a form. Fill it in if you'd like. Here's a pen, I'll be over here. [chuckles] Did you see this.. [phone beeps] It's just... Hold on. [dial tone] [Khaya]Khazi, are you okay? Dad? Hi. I'm fine. Everything's fine. I should've called you yesterday. I was so worried, I thought your car got stuck, or I didn't send you enough money for petrol. My professor gave me like, extra credit work and I'm just really involved. Captain, Captain. So you gonna make it tomorrow then? I don't think I'm going to make it at all. I was looking forward to it. Aren't you busy on a case? Yeah. But I had plans for us. I'm sorry dad. Tell me more about your murder? Does she remind you of mom? Captain, we have to go, come on. Thanks you for calling on your birthday. I'm sorry I didn't reply. I've gotta go. Ah! Ready for action. Bye. [birds chirping] [grating vegetables] [instrumental music] Right, Devout Devotee. Let's see how much pleasure we pack into this for you. I think it's best in life not to focus on what you can't have, but what you do have. And what you have are all the right ingredients for something really sweet, and very filling. [whistle blows] Cover him, cover him. [indistinct chattering] [Tannie]The important thing before any bake is to get some warmth into the oven. Like us, they take a while to really heat up. Sift your flour, get rid of any clumps or stickiness. Add the rest of your dry ingredients. Now add your oil and vinegar. Oil and vinegar aren't supposed to mix, but without either of them this cake is all wrong. They need each other. Now add your vanilla extract, soy milk. [soft music] Now for the tricky prep bit, greasing your baking tins. [all cheering] Sweet always tastes better with a little sour, so fill your cake with oozing citrus goodness. You're obviously no good at catching killers. How good are you at catching balls? [Tannie]Cover the cake. You want it so light, it's almost floating. Hut! [crowd cheering] It should taste like summer. Look what I made! What's the occasion? An actually edible vegan cake is an occasion in itself. [Tannie]It might taste excellent... [Frank]Look at that. [Tannie]...with a dose of home truths. Mm! Right? [chuckles] And they say chickens don't appreciate fine cuisine. Of course! Maria, you're an idiot. Did Constable Klaasen have Dirk and Anna processed? Yeah. You know, if I was the killer I'd be very grateful to those two. They've kept us so busy with all their antics. I really don't think either of them are guilty. Dirk abused Martine. Well, guilty of the murders. Did you follow up that hunch the detective had about the pomegranate juice? I will now. What happened with Marius? Well, it seems some of our local citizens find it amusing that the big city cop can't solve the local murder. They attribute my lack of ability to my abundance of melanin. Well, I attribute his stupidity to how far his head is stuffed up his ass. Sorry for beating you gents! Nice game, eh? [chuckles] Looks like I rattled the big chief. One day you're going to take things too far, my friend. It's rugby, I psyching up the opposition. Cornel, my accountant's still waiting for your transfer? Yeah, sorry about that. Marius, you know how things have been with Martine's death, and she left some of the paperwork in a mess. I'm at risk for you on this deal, so get it sorted. Let me know if you want my guy to take a look at your accounts for you. No, thank you, I'll sort it out later. [instrumental music] [Hattie]Thank you for coming to meet me on such short notice. I've heard the chef has good buns. I wanted to talk to you about the upcoming elections. Elections? Is it this year? For the local business forum. Oh. Mr. Van Wyk suggested I might want to run as secretary. But I'm secretary! And you're excellent at it! Which is why I've decided to run as chairperson instead. Mr. Rabie is chairperson. -For the moment. -For the past five years. I've also spoken to Jacqui Baloyi about joining the forum and running as Treasurer. You're talking about a lot of changes. About bloody time! [instrumental music] Where are those buns? First Martine's house. [suspenseful music] Martine's neighbours? Looking to buy or rent, Ms. September? Neither right now. Perhaps you're planning your next article then. "Local Property Developer Exploits Locals By Actually Charging Them Money To Live Somewhere." Do you? Exploit locals? If you're not looking for property, you should move along. Tell me about your pricing structures, Mr. Rabie? How do your average rentals compare to the other agents in town? Just because your colleague threatened me doesn't mean I've to tolerate this behaviour. Mr. Rabie I can assure you I mean no harm. Just getting some sunshine, and admiring these excellent property advertisements. As you were. Looks like I'd better make more vegan cakes. [chuckles] Maybe next time I'll make you one. Just for love. You say that. But you don't, do you. Because cooking is a woman's job. But I thought you liked cooking? Oh, and cleaning the guest rooms. I just love that. I'm struggling. I'm not feeling very faithful... right now. I love you, and I love the kids, and I love our life here. But when it comes to the religious stuff, I feel like I'm playing a part. And when you preach? I don't always believe what I'm telling people to believe. It's a bit difficult when my own church doesn't think women are worth ordaining. But you are my wife. I'll always love you, no matter what. I just think needed to tell you. If you pray about it, I'm sure, God can help you. I'm not. [soft music] It's a pity the police haven't solved it yet, eh? It is, very sad. Weren't you investigating too? Just trying to tell her story. Sheryl, cover for me quick. [intriguing music] Hi, cuz! Sorry I couldn't get here earlier. I had to pick up Bronnie, and then I-- Na, na, na, na. Let's go somewhere private. [suspenseful music] Hey. The boss will want to see this, when's he back? Soon I think, he just went for a walk. Okay. I'm gonna leave it on his desk. [knocks on door] If you're here for Georgie, um, she's having a lie down. Actually, no, uh... There are a few things that you and I need to discuss. -Are you sure it was him? -Yeah. [phone rings] Sorry. Hey, Regardt. Sorry, I'll have to call you back in ten. Bye. Look, I just thought you wanted to know first, eh. -Yeah. Thanks Cuz. -Okay, sure. It was you. In fact, you've been following me for several days now. So many gold 4x4s are in town, but it's been you. I can't deny it. But the death threats don't seem like you. Death threats? I think you need to explain yourself. You've been very kind to my kids. And Georgie. I knew that you're in trouble, and... I didn't want any harm to come to you. So, I thought I could keep an eye on you. How did you know I was in trouble? It's a small town, Maria, people talk. So you thought you'd help me by following me and making me believe that I was being stalked by a murderer? I'm grateful. I am. But I think, maybe you... Maybe we need to let the police do their job. Ah. You do need to stop following me. I'll ask God to watch over you. [soft music] Perhaps less conspicuous that way. [birds tweeting] You're kicking me in my mouth, that's... [knocks on door] -Hello! So glad you're here! -Hey. -Oh. Yeah. -Ah, thank you. Where's Khazi? Oh, I'm afraid Khazi's not going to be able to make it. She's in Cape Town. She's doing extra work. Oh, like when dad needs to work on weekends? A bit like that. Thank you for inviting us both, I'm sorry it's just me. Oh, no, anytime! It's been far too long. Mom can we play Dance Dance Revolution? After dinner. Why don't you go get into your new pj's. They have dinosaurs! That's cool! [laughing] Come let's go. Here you go. [Lara giggling] All okay, boss? -Aye, not really. -Did you Want to talk about it? -Not really. -Can I get you a glass of wine? Yes. Please! Oh, sorry, hazards of the job. [soft music] [birds cawing] What'll we have for dinner? [instrumental music] Mm, don't like that. [sighs] [engine revving] Can I get you a brandy, boss? Oh, no thanks. I'm heading over to Maria's for a shift. I'd love to meet her one day. I mean, When all of this is done. I'd invite her, but I want her to cook. Piet, you must score us an invitation, okay? Her cooking is superb, eh, boss? It's definitely something. Piet's always raving about her cooking. Lucky for him I'm not the jealous type. [scoffs] So if you don't mind me asking, is, uh, Khazi really busy with university work? If I were to use my investigative skills, then I'll say no. And not showing up today? She probably didn't plan to. It's easier to say yes to an old man. Shut him up, disappoint him later. I'd better go. I don't want to leave Maria alone. -Okay. -Yeah. Hey! Can I borrow one? Just for today. No? [all chuckling] -You'll be alright? -Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. -Bye. -Bye. [giggling] Oh, my gosh! Okay, go ma. Okay. [laughs] Jessie's dad tried to teach me once. But I never really got the hang of it. -Now you can practice loads! -Mm! I'll practice every night while you do homework. -No! -Yes. Bronnie, did Jessie say when she'd be home? No, she didn't say anything. Message her and ask her to bring milk, please. -Play us another song, mi! -A song? Oh, it will be months before I can manage a song. [laughs] [guitar strumming] [intriguing music] Coffee? That smells delicious. Thank you. I wasn't sure you'd come tonight. What? You don't trust the police to protect you? Oh, no I-I was sure that someone would come but I just thought you might be busy. I am busy. But I wanted to come. -Bye. -Bye. [Jessie]Hi, this is Jessie, I'm not available at the moment. [dramatic music] [engine revving] [honks] What's your problem? [thunder rumbling] I'm sorry I missed you earlier. Earlier? Constable Klaasen told me that you came by. Mm. Oh, that. Don't worry about that. I was worried about nothing, actually. Another threat? If you've received any threat, you should tell me. If you don't tell me, I can't protect you. I promise. No threats. -Another crime? -No, not at all. No. It was, um, it was somebody trying to do good, but just ending up getting in the way. Which how I imagine is how you feel about me. [soft music] So. Tannie Maria. Advice columnist. That is me. Do you have any advice for young adult daughters? Mm. Well, that depends. Would food help? [intense music] Do you really think it was all a lie? That she never meant to come, she just wanted the money? You know, I'd be guessing, when she answer a damn thing. Even if I asked, she'd deny it outright. Be horrified that I asked. And then it would be your fault for even asking. Yeah. But she always finds a reason to ask for more money. Always an excuse, always like, you know "Dad you don't understand." "OMG" "You're so old." [chuckles] I still wish that her mother was still around. Sometimes I feel like I spoiled her after her mother's death. I babied her a bit. Must've been awful. Losing your wife and her losing her mother at the same time. Um, has there ever been an... Uncle Maria? A long time ago. He passed before I came back to South Africa. I'm sorry to hear that. So what brought you to the Karoo? I inherited this house. From my ma... Well, from her aunt actually. And I spent a large part of my childhood chasing her chickens around the backyard, so I thought coming back might be fun. And you? After Khazi went to university I thought it was time for change. Your house was lonely without her? I believe you're only here for a few more months. Oh. Piet has got the countdown calendar going. [Khaya]That's the current plan at least. But right now, I don't know. So you might stay? The Karoo is growing on me. [phone rings] Hello? [suspenseful music] [phone vibrating] Oh, sorry. -Gotta get this. -Mm-hm. Oh, it's work. Hello? [suspenseful music] What? [indistinct chatter] [theme music] [music continues]
