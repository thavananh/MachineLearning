Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- Schuchiin Academy Campus, High School Department. The fourth member of the student council, the accountant, Yu Ishigami While this man is indispensable to the council, we haven't let you get a clear picture of him. The president of the Student Council, is counting on his ability so he was chosen to act as an accountant. This month's accounting report. -Oh, what is it? -He is now waiting for an opportunity. I would like to quit the Student Council. He was about to quit the Student Council. I see. You want to quit the council. Please reconsider! We will collapse if you leave the council. I mean it! Yu Ishigami. He is an expert in data processing. In the Shuchiin Academy, there is a system in which only the president is elected while all other members are appointed based on their ability. Even though he was only a first year student, he was already scouted as the president, for he is an excellent, capable person. Normally, he works at home, and is only present at briefing meetings, but he is a fully-fledged member of the Student Council. He is, without a doubt, the accountant of the Student Council. -But he was going to quit the council. -But I have no other choice. -The reason for that was... -The reason for that was... I think I will surely get killed. Killed? -By Shinomiya. -Shinomiya? I think she will kill me. What makes you think that? Her eyes. Her eyes? People's eyeballs are an organ directly connected to the brain. Usually, half of the brain is used for the sense of sight. What people are afraid of, or what people are starving for, the brain activity is shown clearly on the eye movement. When I see people's eyes, I understand five or six percent of their true nature. Those are strange numbers! Even I can understand that much. Shinomiya is sometimes looking at me with terrible eyes. She, undoubtedly, wants to kill me. Just what are you saying happened? It happened last month. BRAND COFFEE FOR FREE Just as I thought, aren't there many people who find it best to kill time? What is this? We can't really go to a coffee shop. That would get pretty expensive. That's right. It would be great if we had discount coupons for someplace. NONSENSE That's right. Well, as long as it's cheap, we could go there from time to time. Don't tell anyone about those tickets. What was that? She threatened me, that's why I can't tell you. Threatened? I believe she has already killed two or three people already. What happened? Also, last week... Shinomiya, do you like the president? WRONG ANSWER What did you say? I like the president? Please, don't say stupid things. There's no way I would like him. Don't you think he's boyfriend material? What? Of course not... Really? I'm really bothered by being the subject of such rumors! Is that so? I thought you looked good together. Then, I will go to the president and tell all of that in your place. I'll say that it's hopeless. Don't you dare tell him that. Do you understand that? I think she can go so far as having me assassinated. Assassinated? Using the sofa corner to attack and strangle me was a professional move. Just who do you think Shinomiya is? I think she likely has the nature of a serial killer. You can see it in her eyes. Isn't he too confident considering his lack of accuracy? Fujiwara is in even more danger than I am. She sometimes looks at her as if she wasn't even human. I think she's got less than two months to live. You've already done the calculations? Don't be stupid! No, people like her are the most dangerous. President? Have you seen Ishigami? The conference earlier... Don't make it worse for yourself! It's regarding the budget of the drama club. Surrender yourself, Shinomiya! Hey! Listen to me first! Didn't I tell you that the drama club needs some assistance? They are fitting the costume today. Yes. Even so, you didn't need to bring that prop with you. Well... That is because I was in the mood for a little prank. I am sorry. She's cute. Shirogane, this is a trap. She is acting cute, so you'll let your guards down then she'll cut you up. Don't say scary things. That is just a costume, Shinomiya wouldn't kill anyone! President! Please, help me. Kaguya killed me off! As I thought! Just what are you thinking? It's just a special makeup. Oh, that's right. No, President. This is also a trap. Maybe she really died, and Shinomiya performed a creepy operation on her. Accountant Ishigami. You always think too much. Shinomiya would never kill anybody. Try to believe more in your friends, okay? Believe in friends? That's amazing, by the way. Right? How did you apply it? Just like this! I am sorry. Believe in friends. Ishigami? About that matter... I am happy you didn't talk to anyone about it. It's a virtue to be able to keep your mouth shut. Next time, if you talk... Believe? I wouldn't be using this toy knife, okay? Also, please stop bothering the president. Don't talk about quitting the council anymore, okay? -Will you also stab the president? -What if she... -Is it okay? I want to try it, too! -by any chance... was listening from the start? Today's result... ISHIGAMI WANTED TO QUIT BUT HE CAN'T BECAUSE HE WAS SCARED OF KAGUYA ...Ishigami lost. THE WOMAN OF LOVE AND HATE You are seeing different animal cages. How many cats can fit into that one? Why are you asking me such an abstract question? It's a psychological test. I borrowed this from the library. Just by answering these questions, I can get a clear and comprehensive image of your deep psyche. That's worthless. You think you can understand people just by asking these questions? Well, let's just try it anyway. How many cats? I think about nine cats? This is the number of kids you want to have. Amazing! It's on point! -Nine! That's a large family! -Nine! That many? Psychological test. A test that draws out a person's true nature with abstract questions. Many elements of the game have cited a strong influence of the Barnum effect. But among those, there are also practical results based on psychology. This test has brought painful experiences when people thought about it entirely as a game and were negligent. There are many other interesting questions. Let's play it together. Do you want us to join, too? Yes. Ready, everyone? You are walking on a gloomy road. And somebody taps your shoulder from behind. Who do you think it is? Give me another hint. It's not a quiz so it doesn't work like that. I see. A gloomy road. Just what is that suggesting? I know it! It's the second question on page 47! The answer to that is... it is the person that you like! If you said the name of the person you like, it's would turn out like a confession. As usual, she was prepared for this situation as well. She was friends with Chika Fujiwara since childhood. Kaguya knows her behavioral patterns well. Ever since she saw the book has been added to the library, she guessed that it was very likely for Fujiwara to bring it to the council. Kaguya thoroughly checked that book. Question! You found a squirrel. -She could avoid dangerous answers. -What do you do with it? Let me see. I would cook for her every day and massage her before she goes to sleep. The answer is... that is how would you treat your partner after marrying him. In other words, when it comes to the minefield of this psychological test, she had a great advantage. That's right. My answer is you, Fujiwara. What? Me? A gloomy road... Why are you running away, Ishigami? For me... it was Shinomiya. Me? Is that how he feels? He's a good kid and it's not like I hate him, but... I am sorry. I can only think of him about as much as I do of a cricket. Ishigami was rejected. Well, the problem is the president. Kaguya is cold and scared, she doesn't like this. President, let's go back together. That's true. I am... Now. Wait! Why is she smiling like that? She said it's an interesting question. What that romantic brain of hers is interested in can't be a proper test. What if the answer to that is the person you like? Well, President. Deep down you always liked me very much, right? How cute of you! That would be like confessing my feelings! I have to pick someone with whom I have a relationship they approve of. Then... That would be my sister, probably. The person who tapped your shoulder is the one you like. In other words, you have a sister complex, President. You're the most boring among us. Yes, I have a complex. I like Shinomiya? Why does it feel terrible? President, I am suffering from the Stockholm Syndrome so I am going home. Take care. It probably coincides with misattribution of arousal. I am going to the hospital. I want to answer questions, too, so let's search some on the internet. Damn it! Fujiwara will pick some questions outside of the book! Oh, this is cute! You are now on a broad field of flowers. The person who owns it told you to pick as many flowers you as like. How many do you pick? It's a question of which you don't know what the answer symbolizes. Flowers? I would pick beautiful flowers and cherish them. I wouldn't need a lot of them. I would pick enough to make a flower bouquet that I would love. I see. What should I do? I answered without noticing. How many would you pick, President? Well, it's the same system as before. So maybe I should answer it normally. You can pick flowers you like for free? Then my answer can only definitely be this one. I would fill a truck with flowers and drive it away. I think the truck wouldn't be enough either. You have a poor person's mentality. What would you do with so many flowers? -It would be easy to give or sell them. -The answer is... THE QUANTITY OF FLOWERS YOU PICKED SHOWS HOW MUCH YOU LOVE SOMEBODY What was the answer? It was how much you love flowers. That was about it. -But I love flowers! -That's stupid. I don't agree with this. That's true. -Today's result, -But that's what it says. -Shirogane lost. -So you have to accept it. COST OF A FAMILY IF YOU GET THE HCG VACCINE THERE IS A 20% CHANCE YOU WILL HAVE TWINS Should we get a smoothie on the way home? Okay! I want a celery one. What should we do? I am sorry! I need to work part-time today. I have to go straight there? Again? You work too much. You're definitely coming next time! Sure! It's time to go home, Ms. Kaguya. Hayasaka. I told you not to come to the Student Council room. I checked first if the president and the others have gone home. Please, relax. This kind of negligence is fatal. You haven't been paying attention lately. Those clothes, the nails and your skirt's length are all violating the school regulations. They're all within school regulations. Well, there are several loopholes in the school regulation. Several? For us, beauty is power. BEAUTY IS POWER People who don't beautify themselves don't belong in high society. I don't want my chance to be stolen by a woman who is only pretty. And you are too formal, Ms. Kaguya. Even in this high school, nail polish has gotten popular lately. If you want boys to think you are cute, you should develop a taste for such things. Really? If I did that, the president... No, the boys would think I am cute? You have been wearing such tattered clothes so far. Of course. Hayasaka realized that nail polish didn't much matter with the opposite sex. However... For boys... Anyway, let's get back quickly and paint those nails. -The desire to dress Kaguya stylishly... -How do you mean? -Influenced her answer. -What is it? NEXT DAY They used a kind of nail polish that wouldn't violate the dress code. The limestone painted on the ring finger has an appeal to modesty. What will the president think? Will he think it's cute? Or... maybe he will think I'm being shallow? What are you intending to do? What's with those nails? They're just nice. I would hate it if he asked me like that. I'll go home today, after all. What are you doing, Shinomiya? Aren't you going in? No, I am going in. Kaguya! I have a question about this part. Yes, what is it? Are you hiding something behind your back? No, nothing at all. She always has good intuition in times like this. If someone were to notice, I want it to be the president. Even if it's wrong, I don't want this kid to notice. I have to get closer to him. President, this is a record of the proceedings of the other day. Thank you. This part here is the problem. That's right. It's a big problem. You are right! He didn't notice! Shinomiya is getting fashionable! Why didn't he notice? Does this mean he is not interested in me? Why did she change her attitude? She always says, "Does a swan need to dress up?" She never paid attention to fashion. What should I do? Is this something I can allude to? You have a body fit for bearing children. Wouldn't that be considered a matter of sexual harassment? Also, lately... Kei, isn't that skirt too short? It's not like I was showing it to you, bro. And that's sexual harassment, by the way. I was just worried about her as a brother. Anyone's reaction, except for the person that you want, has a tendency to be considered as sexual harassment. However, I should at least let her know that I noticed. She probably won't insult me worse than my sister did. Fujiwara. You changed your conditioner, right? You noticed that? Oh, well. The smell is different than usual. Today, you could say that it's stuffy, but it smells adorable than usual. If I were to compare it to your smell before, it's like a baby's smell. Ishigami. That's creepy. I want to die... I want to die, so I will go home. Okay, but don't die. I wanted to compliment her, because it smelled nice. Do I smell? Is it bad? That was harsh! The day Shinomiya tells me I am creepy, I will also want to die! I think, it's best not to mention the nails. The risk is too high. I don't want to look creepy. No. Is this also an excuse? This is my problem. Complimenting her nails is... I simply... I feel embarrassed. In the end, he didn't notice my nails. But I think it's better that he didn't notice. As I thought, there's no point in dressing up stylishly. I won't become cute. Shinomiya! Those nails! They're... No, nothing at all. What was it? Tell me, please! He wanted to say that you are cute. She also thinks he's cute. What was he trying to say? What do you think, Hayasaka? Hayasaka! -Did he notice them? -Today's result, Kaguya won. Subtitle translation by Maria Carbune
