Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- MURDER BY THE LAKE We've been here six hours. Hary Prin I’m beat. Margarethe Tiesel Gregor Bloéh - No. - No. Not a chance. If only I still had my van. This car just sucks. Serial killers love routine. They're rote and compulsive. Three victims in as many years, all in the same season. Really? His special unit recruits. No, thanks. I need some air. Zeiler. An angel in the hops... - OK. Yes, thank you. - Get out for a second. Hannu Salone I saw someone out there. - Where? - There. Dispatch called. They got a call from our field. There was someone here. Hey! Police. Cut the crap and come out. - Police? - Yes. Why didn't you say so? Did you just call the hotline? Yes, I did. - An angel in the hops, huh? Yes. - Why did you run? - What would you have done? Wait? You aren't wearing uniforms and scared me shitless. It's OK. This apparition... She isn't an apparition. Like the other victims, she was hanged post-mortem. Her throat wasn't cut, though. She was strangled. - The other times he used a knife. - Maybe something went wrong. But he got his ritual, so he's happy. - Any idea how long she's been up there? - Not sure, maybe... - Fine, we'll take over from here. - We'we or you'we? We'we: Only a small circle should know the details. You know how it is. - Is that your answer? - You think I enjoy this? Your career leap? Yes, I think so -Do you have a name yet? Thank you, that will be all. I have enough staff on my unit. Thank you. Congrats. Komlatschek in Gschwendner's position. - Sure. Still no reason to act like a jerk. - True. The inspector is under a lot of pressure. No one volunteers for such a case. May I? Yes, of course. I'm not sure that ankle means anything. - It does. Can you send this to me? - Sure All victims spent four days in captivity before dying. Yes, on bread and water. But not raped. Thank you. There's no matching missing persons report. Is there a body in the hops field? My wife! Is it Maike? - Stop him. - Is it Maike Vogel? - He's an old friend. - Is it my wife? It's OK, I know him. What are you doing? -Is that Maike? Maike? Why? - Is it Maike? - No, it's not. Why? What happened? What's going on with Maike? - Two days ago, just like that. The door was open... she left her phone, keys, everything! I'm sure there's an explanation, Tobi. Have you been arguing lately? Not at all. She vanished, now of all times! It shops season! - She wouldn't just walk out on you. Exactly. Your missing persons report? Nothing points to a crime, much less to the hops killings. Your wife doesn't fit the mold. Thanks for your understanding. The victims are all blond, Maike's a brunette. She's gone, now of all times. It can't just be a coincidence. He has her. No. That bastard has Maike. - Help me, please. - I... Tobi... We were friends, Tobias and me. We lost touch after Luna was born I can't act like nothing happened. I have to do something - So you haven't seen him for ten years? - Yes, why? How can you know what Maike's really like? Or your old friend? - You mean you don't believe him? - I didn't say that. Just considering... You heard Egger. This murder isn't like the others. - Yes, we should look into it. - OK. I thought maybe you could put your charm to work on Egger. When you get a chance. - Did I scare you? - No. - Or upset you? - No. The groceries took you long enough. You OK? Yes, your tea will be right up, Didi. Coffee would be nice. - But today is an even day. - Please, Hilde, coffee. Do me the favor I have something for you. A surprise. That's why I was gone when you woke up. What do you say? It's newfangled, but the coffee's supposed to taste better. Try it out. But we need capsules for that. Yes, of course. You're right. How often do I have to tell you: the bike belongs in the bike stand... The woman died yesterday afternoon. Around 3:00 or 4:00pm. - It really is Komlatschek's case. - An old friend might be affected. If the killer is going after brunettes now. We can't count it out! - So far his preference was obvious. - What I mean is... No need to argue. It's not your case anyway. Still, something's off this time. So, this time the hair was cut. Until now, our killer used a razor blade. - See? And the way the barbed wire was wrapped is also different. - And the hair? - Missing as always. So it's not about method, it's about hair. A ritual. His prey. I have something else. That's not an abrasion. Let's pursue this. And Maike's case as well. - Maybe your friend made it up. - So he made his own wife disappear? I'm sorry, it's a possibility. This may be news to you, Zeiler, but friends help each other. What kind of nonsense is that? A copycat? This time the woman was strangled. The barbed wire was tied differently. And her hair was cut, not shaved. - I know what I'm dealing with here. - What’s that? A dissenting opinion. What if it was made to look like the serial killer? Blond hair, same age, similar body type. - All the triggers match. - Still, I know Maike. She wouldn't take off like that What if it is a copycat? Who gave Komlatschek the corpse he was looking for? Tobi could be right and Maike was kidnapped after all. Ms. Zeiler, help me out here. The killer keeps his victims in captivity for four days. Maike's been gone for two. Zeiler, this would be a good time to come to my aid. I know how we can find out who the dead woman is. There you go: how 'we' can find out. You won't ever give me a break. The woman had a skin irritation on her ankle. From laser treatment She had a tattoo. Which was removed. - I'll go find out where she got it. - No, we are going to find out. Yes, we. - Hello, Dad. - Hey, sweetie. - How was it? - Super. - I'm sorry, I have to finish this. - Hey, Micha, you doing handiwork? Hello, Karsten. Shit. - Better leave it to a pro. We're glad to help with the costs. Karsten, please. You already paid for the house Still, that's a job for a professional. Kim's trial period is over. You deserve it. - Kim works half days. - Micha, she's a speech therapist. Soon she'll be making more than you if she gets that three-quarter position! -You didn't discuss that either? No, we didn't. Who'll look after Luna? Let me guess, you talked to her. - As grandparents we'd be glad to help out. - Why don't you guys just move in? Oh, that's the plan? The older you get, the less space you need. - Are you completely nuts? - Micha, please. It's a big house, it could be developed. I kind of like the idea. - Now I get why you paid for it. - Micha. Oh, stop it. You bought your way in. No reason to get upset. It's the perfect solution. We have time for Luna. Does Kim know about your plan? - We only want to help. - Yes or no, Karsten? You're not the only unhappy one in your marriage. -Excuse me. Think it over. Tobi, what are you doing here? Back then, I helped you out, too. - What? - The mushrooms. - Quiet, my father-in-law's here. - I saved your life. - I didn't even know what it was. And it was a long time ago. You gobbled it up like popcorn. - What do you want? - I need your help. You owe me. Tobi, I'm doing what I... come inside. Your mother's final resting place is in Bregenz. The grave space will also easily hold your father's urn. It will not! So, your parents' last will was... I mean, whatever happened. Without my father she wouldn't be lying there. - But your father... - My partner shot him. - So where do you want to bury his remains? - I thought you'd have a suggestion. Fine, I'll take care of it. Since you have no family left, if you need anyone to talk to. - No, thanks. - You have friends, so much the better. Yes. No, I understand. Can you send me the women's names? Yes, thank you. And call me if you hear from Mrs. Vogel. Thanks. Where were you? You'd do anything for a friend. An option no one thinks through to the end... but we could! I like that, I mean... that you see it that way. Is everything OK? I'll get us a cup of coffee. URNS FOR THE HOME The victim is the wife of a hops farmer. Here. - Josef Reike - No missing persons report. But it's clearly her body. Can we? Why the hurry just to deliver a death notice? - Hello, can I help you? - Chief Inspector Komlatschek. My colleague, Mr.Oberlander. - Brockmann. - We're looking for Mr. Reike. - Follow me. Joseph, you have visitors. - Police. - How are you. Hello, Mr.Reike.Oberlander. My colleague, Mr. Komlatschek. How are you. - What is it? - It's about your wife. What about her? I thought she was at the spa. Getting massages and stuff. I treated her to it. She liked things like that. Four days... long weekend. It's not my kind of thing. And the farm I have things to do. A spa hotel at Untersee. I can dig up Jutta's reservation. Yes, please. Did you book it for her? I work for Joseph. For the Reikes. Didn't you miss your wife? No call, no mail? - Jutta said there was no reception. - Any arguments? No.Well, occasionally, but never anything serious. Like... In any marriage. Why do you ask? Because we have to, Mr.Reike. Where were you when it happened? Yesterday between 3:00 and 4:00pm? At that scumbag's office. He's constantly making me come in. - Does the scumbag have a name? - Yes, Christian Taublin. - A business meeting with the brewery. - Taublin Brewery? Do you remember what your wife was wearing No idea. - Anything noteworthy? - A raincoat. I remember that. Yes, right. - The silver one. - Yes, she was fond of it. - I'd like to be alone now. - Of course It looks like the farm has seen better days Joseph hasn't done as well as his parents. Hops prices are dropping off. Joseph isn't good with numbers. I do the bookkeeping. Why Jutta? I mean, why those two, of all people? Joseph loved his wife so much. It was wonderful to see. Thank you. - Sure. - Goodbye. - All the best, Miss Brockmann. I'll check his alibi with Taublin. Fine, but I'm looking for a serial killer. -That excludes the victim's husband -You think so? An accident with a motorboat, huh? The propeller tore his side open. He makes it to the shore, but loses too much blood May I? -Hit and run? Small fast boats are loud and bulky. A collision like that can go unnoticed on board. But there's something odd about the injuries Rose! Thanks. TAUBLIN BREWERY Mr.Falkner often made employee of the month. Meticulous, orderly, self-sacrificing: - Did something happen to him? - What makes you say that? You're from homicide, you have his company car. Ongoing investigation. A boiler attendant has a locker, right? It was a pleasure. Thanks so much. Goodbye. Zeiler. - What a surprise. - Likewise. - Hello, Oberlander, Lindau Homicide. - Taublin. I know, I just talked to your wife and father-in-law. - Do you want to see the locker? - Yes. -Hello, Norbert. The victim was a boiler attendant. - No shit? - I'm with Marie. Can I call you back? - I hope you didn't upset the old man. - Your father-in-law? How? You mean with a police visit? I run the business more successfully than he did, but I still get flak daily. Sounds familiar. I have one like that, too. I don't have a key. Don't you have... Meticulous, orderly.. Wait a second A silver rain coat. It belongs to Jutta Reike. Didn't you have a meeting with Joseph Reike yesterday? Yes, yesterday around 3:00 pm. It lasted about two hours. He even took on the family name. But his father-in-law sees him as an upstart. Falkner. Looks like he's our serial killer. Maike is still missing. - I know. But we can't ignore the connection between Falkner and Jutta Reike. Where are you off to this time? - I have an appointment. - An appointment? - I'll be back at the office at 1:40 pm. - Wonderful. Hello. Mrs. Falkner? - Yes. Hello, Chief Inspector Komlatschek. My condolences. You're very orderly. I like that. My husband likes it that way. Order is a sign of respect, he told me. You do it for him? One cares for the things one holds dear. Nothing wrong with that, is there? No. - Would you show me the house? - Be glad to. Please... This is our bedroom. Solid oak. Cosy. What side do you sleep on? - Here. The evidence is clear. You're not listening. I just can't follow you. The trail leads to Dietrich Falkner. Yes, and he's dead. You found the perfect proof yourself: the rain coat. Jutta Reike is Falkner's fourth victim. The case is solved, period. And where's the hideout? Where'd Falkner lock his victims? In this garage? - We don't know yet. - And you don't care? One victim -in hops season four years in a row! Maike could be dying in a hideout and you won't find her because you refuse to look! - It's true, no permit necessary, but... - Great, then that's the solution. There are two types of urns, a burial urn... - And one for the house. - Yes, I know. This one only contains a symbolic amount of ashes. The burial urn can go in my mother's grave. But didn't you say that.. Who checks the symbolic. amount? No one. The funeral urn is empty. - You're taking all his ashes home. - Do we have an agreement? The serial killer case is closed, Tobi. The killer's dead. So Maike really just took off, like everyone says? Of all explanations, wouldn't that be the most bearable? Maike wouldn't do that. You know her. Yes. Did you build all this by yourself? My father-in-law would make me his sole heir if I had. For mine, I'm second choice. Just a carpenter, not the academic he hoped for. - Can I see Maike's den? - Sure. She decided to go it alone back then. Wow. -Advertising, right? .Yep. - A small agency, it's doing quite well. Great place to work. Yes. Maike loves this space. Except she felt watched sometimes. - Watched? - Yes. She'd think someone was looking up towards her from out there. Over there. There. - So there really was someone here. That's Falkner's boot. And this is the footprint I found near the Vogels'. Same size and profile. Footprints alone won't do. They make rubber boots like that by the ton. Maike Vogelfelt stalked. She was at home and she disappeared from there. Something else isn't right. The way the serial killer died A hit-and-run accident. What if the collision on the lake wasn't a coincidence? - The murderer murdered? - Why not? We have to find Falkner's hideout. Maybe there are two victims. - Maybe Maike is still locked up. - It would be untypical, but who knows? Exactly. Everything's untypical right now. The good news is neither of us is in charge, so we can split up. I see, so you go after your leads and I go after mine? OK. This is who we're looking for Maike Vogel. The car's mileage shows Falkner's radius was small. He went to work, to the lake and home. Everything else he did on foot. We're looking for some kind of enclosure, man-made or natural. We have little time and can only hope the victim's still alive. Let's go. A staff outing? You mobilize an army, and under my flag? I had to improvise. What are you doing here anyway? You can withdraw, thank you. Komlatschek. Hey! The cabin is Dietrich Falkner's. The land register would've told you that. Some of Jutta Reike's things are inside. And sperm traces in the bed. Egger said that none of the victims were raped. You still don't believe Jutta Reike is a victim of our serial killer, do you? A copycat is still an option, Komlatschek. We're outside our serial killer's cabin and have traces of our hops victim. - Yes, but... - No buts, We have no trace of Maike Vogel Not here, nor anywhere in this case. Wise ass! Yes, Oberlander here. I need a forensic team. Before it was stolen the boat was undamaged. - That can't be from Falkner. - It must have run into something. Maybe a rock. Thank you. Joseph? - Let me see. - It’s OK. You shouldn't be working right now. What else can I do? You'll get over it. Surveyors, They were here before. - Sorry, I'd forgotten. - No problem. - Beer? - Yes. Tobi, I'm sorry, we did our best. All we have is your statement. - So you think Maike's shitting me, too? - You wouldn't be the first it happend to. No, not Maike. She's been kidnapped. I must have overlooked something, something from her past. There has to be a key. Excuse me. I'll be right back. - Micha, what's wrong? - I'll explain later. Zeiler, it's me. Where are you? OK, I'll be right there. - Clubbed to death? He got run over. - He makes it to the shore... - And someone clubs him? - Yes. In any case, this wound didn't come from the propeller. The boat was stolen undamaged and found in the reeds. It wasn't wrecked there, though. But where Falkner was found there are a lot of rocks. And on this one I found traces of varnish. Murder. I also have something interesting. Come with me. I thought of something I almost overlooked. Follow me. She did beer ads with her agency. Maike Vogel? You wouldn't have come if I'd told you right away. - That's not true. - What? Sure I would have. Here. There's a connection between Maike Vogel and the killer. -The victims weren't chosen at random -No. - What are you doing here? - We rang the bell... - Go away, please. - Listen, we... We're taking this, it's evidence. Please. But bring it back. I radically changed the marketing strategy. - So no more beer queen contests? - No, those days are gone Surely you still have records of them. - Yes, I should have them somewhere. Good I gave the company a makeover when I took over the business. Ten years ago, beer queen events were old news. - Can we take this? - Of course. Thank you. Out with it. I told you so. How's that? Maike Vogel is his victim Afraid so. But why isn't Jutta Reike on here? -Stay out of it, I said! Why? Now that your special unit is done? - We have a murderer and his victims. - But one's missing: Maike Vogel. And one victim doesn't belong on your list: Jutta Reike. - So, he's convinced you too? - Before he even knew. Komlatschek, look at this! The women knew each other. This is Maike Vogel. Falkner targeted all of them. They knew each other. - Where is this? - The Miss Beer Contest ten years ago. Miss what? - Beer Queen It was once a year, same time each year. Five women on the photo, four are victims. All except her. And we need to question her: Silvia Brockmann So it's not about the same look or type. No, that was only for the occasion. They had to look the same for the ad. Maike Vogel is Falkner's fourth victim. That's my responsibility. You investigate Jutta Reike's murder. It is a copycat murder after all, not a serial killing, so it's your case. I'll summon the special unit again. - You go and summon. But I won't wait that long. He told us so... I can't believe Micha sold the van. It harbored the wrong memories. What's wrong with a trip around the world? That's what it was for. Trip around the world? He never mentioned that. I can take a look at your building project. Luna’s room, I mean. I got pregnant. That's why, right? You'd never have come along. A year of camping, living out of a backpack. And then came the pregnancy. You never talked about it? They weren't real pageants. It was all show. It was just a barn festival. I jumped in because the agency was one woman short. One model had fallen ill or something. - Maike Vogel was the agent. That one, the dark-haired one. She organized everything and asked me to pose in the pictures. It was a festival for everyone. Brewers, farmers. That's all. No, that's not all. These three women are dead. - Jutta isn't in the picture. - No, but Maike Vogel is. She's missing. We have to assume the worst. Did anything unusual happen that day? We didn't have beer for the event. The delivery truck driver zoned out and crashed. How come? - Masturbating while driving. - Excuse me? Who found him? The women in the picture. They were in a minivan and got there first. They pulled the driver out, with his pants open and a porno mag. I know it was a long time ago, but do you remember his name? Didi. Dietrich Falkner, from Taublin Beer. It's the ultimate humiliation. He can't forget and obsesses about it. More and more, until he turns into a murderer. Torturing them for days, so they feel as degraded as he did then. Exactly. Help! Help! Another one? I don't know her. - Maike Vogel. Excuse me. I hate to admit it, but you were right. You'll get over it, Komlatschek. First we look for Maike Vogel, then we go after Jutta Reike's murderer. Unless the two cases are related. OK, let's get started. - We're aborting. - What? - We're calling it off. - You can't do that, we have to keep going. - There's no point, Mr. Vogel. - If Maike dies, it's your fault. - And? - Nothing. Nothing at all, not a trace. I have a theory. Jutta Reike's murder was made to look as if it were Dietrich Falkner. Then Falkner gets run over and killed. The accident and the copycat killing are related. Falkner as a scapegoat for Jutta Reike's murder. Yes. Someone knew he was the serial killer. Long before we did. That someone is Jutta Reike's killer. And he placed traces of her at Falkner's. -False evidence. Exactly. In his car and in his locker. Someone who knows all about him. Oberlander. What? Yes, I'm coming. Yes, I'll be right there. Yes. - Luna! - Dad! What did you do? How are you? Let me see. Oh, man... It didn't even happen on horseback, but when she dismounted. Where’s Kim? She had to jump in at work. I'm sure you know how that is. I want to go home. We'll go right now, sweetie. She has to get back on a horse soon. To overcome her fear. Thanks for the advice, Karsten. Just like that, right? We need a lot more hops to get the same product, the same taste. I think the price is reasonable. OK.I can sell my hops elsewhere and terminate our contract. Can you? What do you really want? You want my farm? You want the hop fields? The farm has been in my family for generations. Excuse me. You have no family. Not anymore. I believe it's a good offer. It's good for one week. After that the price will drop. Don't wait too long. Say hello to your wife. The cabin is Dietrich Falkner's, but it wasn't his sperm. Exactly. But the female DNA proves Jutta Reike was there. As does her bag and other things. But Dietrich Falkner wasn't there. So whose DNA is it? A male's, that's clear enough. And unknown. As yet unknown. Yes, Kim, it's me again. It would be great if you'd call me back. You were in Dietrich Falkner's cabin, right? Komlatschek was there too, it was a hoot. - Why? - Because there's no DNA of Falkner there. If he'd covered his tracks we wouldn't have found the sperm. Exactly. He wasn't there. But the tire tracks clearly belonged... Wait a second, the brewery has several company cars. Identical. The cars aren't explicitly BZ-348DP assigned to the employees So basically anyone can use them? - Yes. What about logbooks? That might be a problem. They haven't been kept so well. - Why not? - Thank you. Speak soon. - Shit! - My Secretary. -Shit! Where is she? - We found' sperm in the cabin. Several DNA traces. If we don't get an answer, I'll have your male staff take a DNA test. And you'll be the first. Understand? My family can't find out about this. Especially not my father-in-law. Do you understand? We're looking for a murderer and a missing person. Spare me your trifles. Jutta called it her' spa weekend. You had an affair with the wife of a business friend. - We're not friends. - Oh, in that case... What about the cabin? I'm an angler, it's a hobby of mine. I'm a hobby angler. That's what you told him. I showed Dietrich Falkner my angling gear and he gladly put his cabin at my disposal. Four days of fun with Jutta Reike by the lake. You want us to believe that? - Why not a hotel? - I’m a beer brewer. There's a tap of mine in every bar, every restaurant, every hotel. Known in every nook and cranny. And it wasn't four days, it was one night. I had some things to do at the office, and when I came back she was gone. You know you're a murder suspect now, right? DNA. Cross-test. You're really picking up steam. I'm scared we'll be too late, Zeiler. Yes. My wife and that pig? Never. Jutta would never do that to me. Noway. The traces in the cabin support Taublin's story. Did you know? That your wife was cheating on you? What are you saying? You think I killed my wife? Jealousy is a strong motive. And you work the hops well. If it's true, why didn't I string that bastard up and not her? Jutta and I met when the farm was still thriving. I took it over from my parents when the hops prices were soaring. I should never have given Taublin the exclusivity I did. The price dropped, the harvests were bad, we were fucked. But Jutta always stuck by me, in spite of everything. And I kept going. But I don't care anymore. I'll just sell. - Hello, Tobi. - Hey, Luna. Well? - With your parents always butting in! - Oh, my fault? Be glad they're helping. A broken arm isn't helping, Kim... Do they argue a lot? Don't let it get to you. With your three-quarter job! - Damn it. I'm really trying. - Great, so you need to try? - You don't want it? - What? A normal life, with a house of our own, a yard, a family. Micha, I like all that, I want that. For once tell me that you do, too. Why didn't you ever tell me about the van and the trip? Come on, that was forever ago. Are you happy? Were you ever happy with me, with us? - Yes, of course I was. - What went wrong? Come on, I also like it all. Home sweet home and so on. But I also like my world. - You mean your liberties. - No, I mean my work. Don't you understand that? - Of course, I want that, too. We can't have both or what? - I can't always stand back... Your damn bickering! Is it really necessary? My wife is gone, Micha. Your child is upstairs, afraid of you. You guys really have changed. Dietrich Falkner totally isolated himself. He stopped working for Taublin. He lived under the radar On purpose. No friends, no social contacts. Wouldn't even buy groceries. His wife did. She wrote it down. Always the same stuff, at the same time, at the same store. No changes. Ever. Let's talk to Hilde Falkner again. She’s the link. What if she's just a victim and doesn't know anything? That's precisely the question. - I don't know anymore. Real coffee, no capsules Oh, the schnapps, your homemade schnapps Go on, eat. Hilde, how are you? I'll hold out. Good. Help! Goddamn. Damn air conditioner! - You miss your old jalopy. - I sure do. I know. Chances are slim that she's still alive. Mrs. Falkner? He was your husband, You helped him. Where's my wife? - Tell me. I didn't help him. I always did everything right. Tobi, put it down. Now. Maike... we're running out of time. The old hag knows. That won't help Maike. Not at all. - So put it down. - Where is she? I don't know what Didi has done. You would have been next You knew he was the killer. Nearly all those women were dead. His desire to kill would live on. You were afraid you were next in line. You're wearing a wig, aren't you? It was me. I ran Didi over on the lake. And then I clubbed him on the shore. It was me. This woman steals and hot-wires a boat, runs her husband over, steers to the shore and clubs him to death. Then she dumps the boat and covers the six miles to get home on foot. "I clubbed Didi on the shore," she says. We didn't tell anyone about that, only about the incident on the water. Why is she lying? Why is she confessing? Can you please stop pestering me? The main thing is that Didi is finally dead I don't remember what the boat looked like, it didn't interest me. We've passed it twice already, Mrs.Falkner. There was no machinery then. Everything was done by hand. My father was widowed young and had no time for me. Then the nanny came, Hilde Falkner. First Hilde helped my parents on the farm and was later put in charge of me. - Why is this interesting? - It means something. What? I only see Hilde very casually these days. She's become rather strange, that I'll give you. Probably due to her husband. He's always been weird. Hilde Falkner claims she killed him, but it wasn't her. So now we're wondering why she would take the blame. So you come to me? Your wife and Taublin, the bastard. You couldn't take it. Wellness weekend? As if. She was having fun with him by the lake. You killed your wife, Mr. Reike. - You have no proof. - True. How would you know the ins and outs of the serial killings? Exactly. Because you and Hilde Falkner have a deal. That's ridiculous. - Where is Maike Vogel? - How should I know? It's important for you. If we find her, your story folds for good. Because it would prove your wife's death isn't related to the serial killings. And your ass would be fried. Show me some proof. Hilde Falkner won't hold up to questioning. She'll tell the truth. People always underestimate Hilde. Maybe we'll find Maike Vogel. Maybe she'll manage to escape. If so, come back, Now please excuse me. - We sure will. I was a conscientious wife. I'm sure you were. You were at your husband's cabin, on the lake. There you saw Jutta Reike with another man. Christian Taublin, the fancy beer brewer. Jutta and Taublin? That's none of my business. Joseph Reike often visited you when your husband was at work. He wrote to you, brought small gifts. Look, the things we found... Joseph is your only friend, isn't he? Joseph is a sweet boy. A good boy and a good husband. You appreciate him. But his wife didn't, that hussy! Joseph didn't deserve her adultery, right? So you told him about the rendezvous. What happened next? You saw how that good boy of yours killed his wife. And you offered to help, him being the only person you trust. I won't say another word. I don't have to talk to you. You knew the serial killer well. He was your husband. How handy! So you staged it to make us believe it wasn't good kid Joseph - but evil Dietrich who killed Jutta. - Nonsense. And Joseph had to do you a favor in return. You let him kill your husband. Nice deal. Help! Nothing? Our colleagues are watching Reike. Normal pattern, nothing unusual. Neither of them knows the hideout. Shit. - And now? Give up and go home? - No. Let's think it through again. OK. Dietrich Falkner drives to work, to the lake and home. That much we know. He never drove longer distances. What about the brewery? Maybe the hideaway is there. - In a running operation? The brewery's been rebuilt. Part of it must have been shut down. Maike? Maike? Maike? - And? - Nothing. That can't be. Maike? - Komlatschek. - And? Nothing. OK, let's go, this is pointless. Hear that? I hear something running. There, the tanks. Maike? This one. Yes, here. Komlatschek. I can see her. I have her. Careful. We need an ambulance. Yes, at the old Taublin brewery. Maike! You'll be OK. So you've decided? You're selling? Is that what you call it? Giving it away comes closer. An alibi has its price. I can still spill the beans on you. The oh-so-decent husband of a wife with MS screwing the wife of his business partner. I'm sure that would go over well with your father-in-law. Yes... But who will believe a murderer? You get a load of money and go scot-free. That should do. I'm glad we have an agreement. Drop it. Now. Not bad, given that we stayed out of it. Yes. It's over. Thanks a lot, Zeiler. And Kim was totally right. I won't change. I like my life the way it is. I love my job. Are you sure? Starting next week Komlatschek will be back with us. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll just tell my father-in-law I built the room. Thanks a lot, Tobi. I'm getting Maike's den ready. A surprise for when she gets out of the hospital. - Sure. - Take care. You, too. Will we ever be as happy as those two again? Let's be honest from now on, Micha. We've never been that happy. I'm sorry, Kim. I really mean it. - I know. So am I. My father gave me money, for the renovation. I've invested it well. But that's... Kim, how could you... That's crazy. No drama, OK? We promised Yes, no drama. I'll see you this weekend, when you come to pick up Luna. Thank you. You're too early. You were only supposed to pick me up. Really? You're not just my colleague. I'm glad you bring that up. I don't have a place to stay anymore. Really? What about your van? - Yes, sure, but... Forget it.
