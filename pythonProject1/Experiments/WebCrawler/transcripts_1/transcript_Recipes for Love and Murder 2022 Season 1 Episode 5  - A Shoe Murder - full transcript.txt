Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- [Grace]Previously on Recipes for Love and Murder... The truth is, two citizens have been murdered, and the big bad police detective has no idea who did it. Have you found my velskoen yet? It's sort distressing, knowing that a killer has your shoes. Maria? Definitely pomegranate juice. Do you lick everything? Bur why are they so hung up on the pomegranate juice? -Jessie and Maria? -Yeah. It was Martine's favourite, they wondered if someone who knew that used it to drug her. Doep, I know the rent. I understand, and I do apologise. So, you think you're gonna be able to make a payment today? Within the next 24, 48, 96 hours. Can you tell me what happened last night? I was asleep. Did Ms. September tell you she caught Dirk trying to kill you? Go back to bed! Don't you want to see him go to jail? You must be her cousin. The fashion one. Yes. I've come to arrange her funeral. -Candice Webster. -Would you like a Vetkoek? Hey! [Jared]Nah, her car's just still parked here because she went home with your cop friend last night. -Regardt? -Yeah! [Jared]And the way she kissed him. I reckon that bruh got lucky last night. Dear, Tannie Maria. I have a terrible secret. I'm really worried my fiance's gonna leave me if I tell her the truth. The thing is... I actually can't cook. Did you learn anything new from Grace? Just, um... another man had been visiting Martine, and talking about the past. I was just wondering if I could ask you some questions. I don't know anything more about Lawrence's death. What about his life? And your life? I want to write a story about you. We run a local newspaper but we've never had someone like you on our front page. [vocalizing] [singing in foreign language] [Jessie]For a lot of the workers in our town, the day starts long before the sun comes up. A lot of us don't know their names, or bother to look them in the eye, but without them, our town would cease to function. Today, I want you to meet Grace Zihlangu. Grace was born.. [rattles] [theme music] [music continues] [music continues] You'd think I was running a bloody detective agency! [rattles] [indistinct chatter] [laughter] Hello! I found him. -Are you sure he's the killer? -Yeah, that's Johnny. Doesn't he just look like a killer? Oh! Bronwyn! Riley! Eew, Jess, you forgot the sugar. You know, when I was your age, I was making supper for you and Riley most nights. That must be what gave you you nurturing, motherly side. Morning! Can you drop me off on your way to work? I'm actually gonna work from home today. You don't look sick. We can ride in together, Bronnie. I'm fast now, I've been practising. Bet I can still beat you on the uphills! You know, it's just easier working from home to focus on my writing, get into the zone-- Blah, blah nobody cares. Bye! -What do you want? -Are you John? Like I said, what do you want? Tomatoes? Spring onions? John, darling, don't you remember me? I used to stay with Martine at Christmas, Candy. Candy, of course. I'm, I'm sorry about Martine. Thank you. I'm here to organise the funeral. Martine mentioned that she'd been in contact with you again. -Been in contact? -What would you call it? Having coffee with me, trying to pretend that her bastard husband didn't hit her. He's lucky that the police has got someone guarding him 24x7, otherwise I would've... Did you see her more than once? What do you want to know? Really? Were you having an affair? No, not affair. Not even a kiss. Just a few coffees. She was lonely. -Do you grow pomegranates? -Yeah. I planted a whole orchid for her, and that wasn't enough. I need to get back to selling. Well, how much are the tomatoes? Ten rand for five. You really think he wants her dead? It's hard to say. And the police guards? Detective, it's not my place to criticize... Say whatever you want to say. Some of them fall asleep, or wander off. If I could discharge both them out of my hospital, I would. But until then... I thought the tagline you wrote last week was so clever, the way you rhymed price and twice. Oh, wonderful. And for only 20% extra I'll throw in an online banner. Brilliant! All right, I'll put it all in a quote. Okay. Bye! Maria? Oh! Oh, detective. No, I don't know where any of my staff are today. Might have to rope Doep in to write something at this rate. Oh, okay. Yes, yes, of course I'll tell her. All right, okay. Bye, detective. -Maria? -No, it's me. Um, I'm afraid I'm still sick. But I'll finish up the society round up and that piece on local birding tourism from home. [Hattie]I'm sorry to hear that, Jess, but I'm sure your mum is advising you what's best. Oh, Jess. The profile piece you wrote about Grace. It's magnificent. Well done. Now... Do you still think he's the killer? He looked murderous enough when he was talking about Dirk. I believed him when he said there was no affair though. I think he really wanted there to be one. I think he would've boasted about it. You're probably right. John's as modest as a stallion in heat, usually. [car door shuts] [car revving] [instrumental music] Do you ever get lonely? [laughs] Hattie, my darling. You must know I'm happily married, girl! No, I don't mean that. I mean, working here. Do you ever get lonely? No. I mean, the people are in and out all the time. There's always someone to talk to. No time to be lonely! Hey, Bruce. Hattie, about the rent... [clicking] I could give you 20% off. Yes. Hi! I'll send you the mock ups. Mm-hmm. I've gotta go. Bye! The police called. -Khaya needs you. -He does? Yes. At the hospital. -Why does he need me? -I have no idea. But as editor of the local paper, it's a good idea to keep the local cops happy. Any leads at the farmer's market? Candy's murderer? I don't know. John's definitely an odd character, though. I must say he's never made much an impression on me. I mean, his wonderful biceps, of course. But his frown lines are totally offputting. Maria could you help me with some recommendations, florist, caterer? Actually, Candy, I've got to pop out on some Gazette business, but... Hattie would love to help you. Of course. I could probably even get you some discounts. -Hmm, great. -Those shoes, Italian? You've got such a good eye! [instrumental music] Oh, Mr. Rabie! Oh, I'm so sorry. That is so awkward. -I do have-- -Don't-don't touch me. -I-I was just trying to-- -Ah! Sorry. [September]So, he managed to wheel his hospital bed all the way to her ward. Then ate one of her prescriptions so the pharmacist didn't know what medication she had to receive. -Oh, that can't taste nice. -We can't continue like this. If Anna doesn't press charges, someone's gonna get seriously hurt. Probably her. So, you want me to talk to Anna? You've never asked my permission before. But yes. Please understand that this is highly unusual. Oh, Ms. September, I'm so sorry. I should have asked sooner. How's poor Jessie? Jessie? She's very well. Thank you. Thanks for the tip off about the florist, you're a darling! Flattery always works with Hector. Jessie really does think she can solve this, doesn't she? Just because she's writes for a small town paper, doesn't mean she isn't the best. Oh, I never said she wasn't. I like Jessie. She's got fire. But tell me about you, Hattie. It must be so hard being such a stylish businesswoman in a small town, with no decent designers. Luckily, in small towns we're not that obsessed with appearances. Ah, there are men in this town, darling, of course we are obsessed with appearances. I don't have any problems with the men in this town. So, how long have you been in charge? Oh, ah, almost twelve years now, since my... husband Arthur died. The paper was his? No, he was the undertaker. I took over when old Frank Malcolm retired. You bankrolled it too? No investors? But I'm sorry, it's so American to talk about money. I'm just lucky my dad helped me out when I started up. Is there anything else I can help you with? Yes, actually. Directions to the undertakers. Out the door left, two blocks down on the left. It still has Aurthur's name on it. You're a darling. [instrumental music] [Tannie]Won't you think about it? It's personal between me and Dirk. He hurt Tienie. But I'm sure she would've asked you to press charges. Martine must have been very special. She was. You, Dirk, both so madly in love with her. Even John, when he was talking about her, I could...see how deeply he felt. John? He's, um, Martine's ex, I bumped into him earlier. Oh, John, from long ago. They'd been in touch again recently. My Tienne? She'd seen John? Yes, a few times. -He says they didn't have sex-- - You'll have to go now. Anna. You need to look after yourself. You really do. [instrumental music] Nobody hurts my Tienie! Bloody bitch! Is he like this all day long? All day, Maria. It's so annoying. Oh! Hello, Dirk. I was just visiting the hospital, I thought I'd drop by. What have you cooked? Oh, I didn't... I don't have anything today. I bumped into Marius Rabie on my way in. Was he here to see you? That arse! Yeah. He had the nerve to come here, while I'm in hospital and in mourning trying to get me to sign over my land. He's been hassling us for months, you know. He harassed my poor wife endlessly about it. He wanted to turn my land into a bloody day spa. Martine was against it. She was dead against it. Did-did Martine and Mr. Rabie argue about it? I don't know if I can live there now. Always imagining my dead wife's body in the kitchen floor. [instrumental music] [telephone rings] [knocking on the door] [knocking on the door] Hello, Mrs. Purvis. It's Constable McClintock. I was here the other day when your husband passed away. Oh, yes, sorry, there were so many people that day and so much to... -You had the soup? -Aye. -It was a excellent soup. -Thank you. You doing all right? Everybody's been very helpful. They bring casseroles. Everybody's so kind. And the undertaker... so efficient. I'm glad to hear it. It's normal. -What is? -Whatever you are feeling now. I've seen it all, really. Sad, empty... angry. I wonder if I can come inside and ask you a few questions? -About? -Oh, it's just standard stuff. We like to follow up on any deaths in the community. I can come back another time, if you'd rather. Yes. Another time. -I think that's best. -Aye. Take care, Mrs. Purvis. [instrumental music] [sighs] Huh! Never get tired of this hunting spot of yours. When you want to sell I've got a list of rich city okes who would kill to have something like this. I think I'm gonna hang on to it. Some things not even the Koop can provide. I finally got the bloody lawyer on the phone, the paperwork's ready. The three Koop franchises we spoke about? Robertson, Worcester, Oudtshoorn, all yours. Ah! Whew! It's about time! I can close the deal this week. Just make sure you sort out the money transfer, and I'll do the rest. [chuckles] Ah! There she is. -You ready to catch some dinner? -Let's do it. [up-tempo music] Come on, Regardt! Nah. But you love this song, brah! Just got a lot going on. Tell Uncle Piet. What's wrong? -It's complicated. -Oh, yes? Okay, if you don't want to tell me why don't you write a letter to Tannie Maria. We can't have long faces like this at work, brah. [snaps fingers] [music continues] [music continues] Oh, good! You can help. -I can't choose. -Uh-huh. Okay. This one is lamb and mint, mushroom and blue cheese, springbok, caramelised onion and brie, spinach and feta. It's been a while since I had springbok. Hmm! I forgot how lovely it is here. I used to love visiting Martine for the holidays. Mm, it was a great place to be a kid. Oh, you're from here? Sort of. Like me then. Were you and Martine always close? Yes, very, poor little David used to follow us around everywhere. Her brother. Anyway, let's discuss the funeral. Um, about the food, Maria-- I'm sorry I haven't been more help, I mean I offered to-- No, no, no. You shouldn't have to help. Gosh, you didn't even know her. It's just that Dirk's useless and... David says he'll only get here on the day with his dad . And he'll mostly be busy trying to keep his father from not falling over. Is his dad particularly wobbly? Uh, Uncle Peter's just really old. And he's had a few falls. Anyway! Let's get this funeral out of the way, so that I can go back to New York City, and you can back to your life. Where are we, food... But, we haven't found the killer. Ah, yeah! I was so sure about John. [instrumental music] -Good shot there, Cornel! -Yeah? Better luck next time. It was me! Sorry! I didn't mean to scare you. I just didn't want anyone else to hear. I'm...the egg boiler. [chuckles] You? -From the letters? -Yes. Sorry. I didn't know whether or not to say something, or... But I've just eaten your pies, they're delicious! Ah, yes, thank you. I'll tell my mother that you think so. Ha! Your mother? Yes, she's the chef here, and always has been. When we opened the place together, we agreed that a young male face should be on everything and... I don't know, we thought it was trendy. I don't know. Well, you do have a very marketable face. Thank you. I mean being a chef is cool. And having only women in the kitchen is such a stereotype. Except that you can't actually cook. At all. Correct. I'm trying to find the right time to tell my fiancée and... Oh, no, she's just gonna think I'm such a fraud. Well, you are a bit. Secrets are no good for relationships. You need to start fresh. Listen, I don't know what's wrong with, um... Please, that...on the house. Oh, well... Maybe you should come for a cooking lesson. I've recently acquired a lot of tomatoes in need of a good home. Yes! I mean, thank you. Yes. That's very generous. I'd-I'd love to. So strange. You are not at all what I'd imagined. [instrumental music] Morag? Morag? Where are you, you wee daftie? [clicking tongue] Morag? [clicking tongue] [tense music] Oh cock! [Maria]Morag! [clicking tongue] Where are you? If that filthy killer has hurt one single feather on your head, I'll... [faint clucking] Oh-oh-oh! Oh! Thank you. [chuckles] Oh! Oh! You gave me a fright. [phone ringing] Hello? Yes. I'd like to report a shoe murder... No, uh, please don't-don't worry about it. We'll-we'll sort it out. Bye. That was Tannie Maria. Her Veldskoen... you know that were stolen the night of Lawrence's murder? I recall vividly. Well, they were left on her doorstep. Cut in half. I'll go down and talk to her, collect them for the evidence team. No, no, no I'll go. It's no trouble for me to go. You need to go home. You worked double shift. I agree with Piet you know. You should get advice. ASAP. [instrumental music] [door closes] -You're home early from work. -Hi, Ma. It's lovely to have you home of course. I just thought it would be hard at it with a deadline. Sorry, we don't all work as hard as you, Ma. You work very hard, Jessie, and you're very good at what you do. Nobody could ever doubt that. You know, when I was a young woman, we were never allowed to sit down. Feed the old people, feed the children, clean the house. There were always chores, and they were always ours to do. I'm glad you don't have that burden. Me too. I envy the women in your generation. Look at you, doing the work you love, working with strong women like Hattie and Maria. Yeah, vivathe sisterhood. [door rattles] Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Rabie, the Gazette is closed. I don't know what you thought you were doing when you decided to run an article about bad working conditions for local labor next to an advert for my business. The profile piece on Grace was a personal tribute to a grieving mother. Your hack journalist rabbits on about how workers in this town are mistreated! Jessie's passionate and fact checked. You...need to lose this holier than thou bullshit. Marius, maybe we can set up a meeting and discuss this with-- I've spoken to Mr. Van Wyk, and he's in agreement. The Gazette stops this politics, or we pull our advertising. Simple. Chop. I beg your pardon? Chops. On special. Wanna take some home? [bell chimes] [sighs] [melancholy music] [fire crackling] [Morag clucking] [instrumental music] Turn your potatoes to the heat... and shake them well, this will help improve your crispiness later. -Hello! -Who is it? -Police! -Oh, come in, it's open! You've got to completely cover each one in duck fat... else your crisp just won't crisp. You really shouldn't leave your door unlocked, especially since the murderer was just here. There! Well, you're right, of course. I've just... I never bothered with security here. Thank you for coming. It was... traumatic. I... Comfort food. [mellow music] I made your favorite . Alright. [munches] You know, Maria, when you try, you're not such a bad wife. Definitely teachable. [Khaya]Will you just tell me exactly what happened? Well, um... I came back and... Ooof! Tomatoes are still in the car! Morag usually comes to greet me, and when I didn't see her I was anxious. But then when I... I saw the shoes... I was so worried they'd hurt her, even killed her. But then... there she was in the oven. Sorry, I don't quite understand. Who's Morag? [wings flapping] That's Morag. She's my best friend. [Maria] You'll realize something is a bit different with this column. I'm giving myself some advice. When I feel like I'm not doing a good enough job, I... need to take a step back, and remember who I am. A real roast dinner... isn't complete without Yorkshire puddings. You'll need flour, milk, and four eggs, preferably from the luckiest chicken alive. Are you're sure they didn't take anything? Nothing at all. [Maria] You have to beat that flour till every single lump is gone. It actually requires a very strong wrist. Then you just pour them into the tins, and they can join all the action in the oven. So when you were on your way here, driving back, did you see anyone unusual on the road? No. Nothing like that. Thank you for writing about her, Jess. [Maria] Roast dinners... are all about balance. And the thing that holds it all together is rich luscious gravy. So, the shoes are obviously a warning. The killer wants you to know that he knows who you are. Oh! Would you like to stay for dinner? Well, I couldn't possibly... Just taste it. Mm! Here. [laughs] Well, thank you. I'm sorry I don't have any wine. I should really be offering you a Pinot Noir with this. I'm on, I'm on duty anyway. Oh! I just remembered! -I made lemonade. -Mm. Mm! Did you go and sort out your mum's house today? No, I didn't have the chance. Well, she had some good plates and bowls. [sighs] Some fancy ones. You could get alright money down on the market. Its a pity, I always thought your mum would have some South African fortune to leave us, sort us out for the rest of our lives. Its about time you contributed something. Happy birthday, Mickey. Thank you! [dramatic music] [wheel rattling] [dramatic music] [Anna shushing] Oh! Oh, you're not Jessie. No. Is she still sick? Doep wants you to pop out and talk to him by the way. Oh, forget about Doep. I don't know about Jessie, I really don't know Maria. Why? She mailed me a piece at 5:00 A.M. this morning calling on all domestic workers to unionize and I can't run it. I really can't. We'll lose all our advertisers! I'm sure Jessie will understand. Well, she might, if she ever came to work! Anyway... Jessie's my problem. I need you to reply to a letter or two immediately, please, else the whole town will be in need of therapy! Sorry, Hattie, I won't go anywhere till you have a column from me. [Regardt] Dear Tannie Maria. It's hard to talk about it when you're feeling hurt. [whistle blows] I'm in love with the best, smartest girl in town and now she's not answering my calls or returning my messages and... I don't know if it's because I sometimes make silly spelling mistakes in my messages. She's a writer with the biggest sharpest mind whose words just help the world make sense. Or maybe she's just embarrassed to be with a boring white guy? -Hey! Everything alright? -Yeah! -Well, come. Let's go. -Yeah, I'm coming. I just know that my lunch breaks are boring without her. She always had new facts and knowledge to share to make the world a little bigger and brighter. And I miss all of her. How do I find light and color in my life without her? Maria, I need that column! Maria! Maria, you come back here! [instrumental music] Hi. Maria. Where's Regardt? I need to speak to him immediately. He's somewhere around. But I could always help you. Oh, thanks, this is something that only Regardt can... Regardt! Good! We need to talk. Privately. Maybe, we could go down there? It's the Detectives office, I'm not allowed to go in there, so... It's important. Sure. I'll be here if you need me. Ah, take a seat. You can sit that side, please. Thank you. Would the police look into a suspicious car? Is someone following you? No, its about Jessie, actually. Her cousin at the hotel told her about a car that stayed there overnight, a fancy sports kind of car that an American might drive, and she just... can't stop wondering why. I mean, lots of cars stay at the hotel overnight. It wasn't a hotel guest though. So did she leave with someone else? That's what... Jessie cant stop thinking about. Where? And with whom... did the car owner sleep that night? Tannie Maria, you don't think I would-- What, Regardt? The last time I saw Jessie was at the hotel. Yes? Candy was very drunk, so I drove her to her guesthouse, just for safety, you know? She was really drunk, okay and-and then she kissed me. Tannie, but-but I would never take advantage of a woman like that, I promise. And I really tried to explain to about Jessie and how much I love her and that I've really been trying to-- Right! There is no time to waste. You need to explain this to Jessie. -But, um-- -Right now. -Right now? -Mm-hmm! No time to waste, what part of that did you not understand? Lovely. Off you go. My shift only ends around 5:00 P.M-- -Go! -Go! Okay. She loves koesisters. [giggles] Morning, Mr. Burger. [gasps] [paper crumpling] Well, she's here more than you are. Sorry, Maria, I just needed to finish the design for the funeral programs. It's no problem, stay there. I think Jessie will be better tomorrow. In fact, I would bet a tin of my gran's secret recipe shortbread on it. Oh, Maria, now that's not fair. Now I don't know which outcome to wish for. [chuckles] [keys clacking] [instrumental music] [door bell] Bronwyn! [Bronwyn]I'm busy with homework! Just go. [door opens and closes] [Bronwyn]It's for you. [sighs] -It's your boyfriend. -Bronwyn! -Hi! -Hi! I, uh, I came to ask a favor... and-and I brought you these. Tannie Maria said they're your favorite. Almost. Koes... Oh my God! You're so white. What's the favor? I-I know she's not really your colleague or anything but... the other night I unfortunately had to escort Candy home... in order for her to avoid drunk driving. Mm-hmm. Um, I know she's ... often at the Gazette office, so... I was wondering if maybe you could give her this police pamphlet on the dangers of drunk driving. She also tried to kiss me... even though I didn't want her to but I...couldn't find a pamphlet for that. I'm sorry they're not your favorites. They are... rapidly growing on me. Tea. Sure. Here we go. -Drive safely. -Thank you! Oh, Hattie-- Twenty percent rent reduction in exchange for Maria including meat in at least three online recipes a week and an ad placement opposite her column offering a special for that exact meat. What size ad? Quarter page. Twenty five percent and I'll throw in the DTP for you too. And no other meat ads adjacent to Maria's column? -None. -Not even for the Koop? I'll let Mr. Van Wyk run veggie ads. Okay. Rent due second of the month, no later, now. Hmm... Ten percent Gazette staff discount for shopping here. Twenty copies of the Gazette giveaway to customers. -Deal! -Deal! Good! -Oh, Hattie. -Hmm! Love that color on you, girl. Hm. I-I swear didn't hear a thing all night. Honestly. [telephone ringing] Karoo Gazette. Hattie Wilson's desk. Yes, sister? God! Escaped! With an ambulance! Dirk and Anna together? Yes, yes, I'll tell Maria. That was Jessie's mom, she said-- Yes, I mean, we heard. But... yesterday when I was at the hospital I told Anna about John, that Martine had been seeing him. She was very angry. We need to get to John's farm and warn him now. -I'm coming too! -Yeah. Bloody well going to have some fun too! Who would've thought John would be the man to get my heart pumping like this. [sirens wailing] [dramatic music] [theme music] [music continues]
