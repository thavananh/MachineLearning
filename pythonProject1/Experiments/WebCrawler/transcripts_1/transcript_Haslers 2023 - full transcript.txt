Please, that’s painful. Lie down. - Babe, I won’t do it again. - Lie down. Stop it, please. I’ve been so patient with you. I’ll never do it again. - Damn, that hurts! - Say it loud! - Please. I won’t do it again. Promise. - Louder. Babe, please. I won’t do it again. Promise. - Hello? - Hello? Why are you all so late? Sorry. I needed to wait for my reliever. And you, Thea? I had to see a client. Good thing he asked his driver to bring me here. Why didn’t you meet him earlier? You knew that we had plans. As if I control his schedule. Don’t worry, I treated all of you. What about you, Hazel? What took you so long? I also had a client to meet. You know how it is. So, just chill. Let me have some! Chill? We have so many things to cover. And we don’t have much time. Chill? Here, have a bite. It’s alright. We’re all here. We can start. I need to smoke. Really now? Just one stick. Another hour? Just one stick! - Just one, promise. - Unbelievable. Just relax, Cheska! Just one! Take a seat, Sofia. Let's start. Relax, you know how those two are. Sofia, show me what you’ve worked on. Here. Cheska never changes. She buries herself in books. You know how she is. We should have brought her with us. Yeah. You should teach her to relax. No, you should do it. She needs to chill. Ouch... yeah, no way. Help me with this... Cover it with your hands. There we go. Do you have some candy? Can I have some? Take your lighter. Or should I just keep it? Give it to me. I don't have any left. Do you have some? Which? As usual. Smoke... I do. I’ll buy some. Sure. After those two are done. Okay. Any problem? I just feel stressed lately. With what? Work, what else? Have you had enough? Do I have any choice? Well, we do. Consider this, Hazel. If I stop, where will that bring me? Back to the gutter? I hate being poor. And you, why haven’t you stopped? Just as you have said it, what will happen to us? We have no families to help us. Well, you can stay with your uncle. Don't be stupid. After what he did to me, I’ll kill him. And you, why don’t you live with your old man? Screw him, too. After he sold me when I was just fifteen, you expect me to return to him? At least, I only have myself to take care of. That’s it. You don’t want to share your money with anyone. Come on, let’s join the two. Cheska must be fuming. - I’ll follow. I’ll just finish this. - Are you sure? Daddy. Run after me. Naughty girl, come to Daddy. Catch me, Daddy. You, naughty girl... Daddy! You, naughty girl... - No, Daddy! - This is what you deserve. - You, naughty girl... - Daddy! Keep going! So good! So good! - I’m coming! - Do you like it, Daddy? Give it to me. I’m coming. Here. Here’s your allowance. Thanks, Daddy. You’re truly sweet. Goodness... You're spoiled. By the way, I haven’t paid my tuition fee. What? Wait. Here. Here. Thank you, Daddy. I need to go. Bert is there. My driver will bring you to your school. - Okay, Daddy. - I’ll go ahead. - I'll go now. - Have a safe trip. Yes, it’s her. It’s Hazel. What happened to you, Hazel? Are you okay? What happened, Sofia? Really, 40 out of 100? Look, I almost didn’t make it myself. That’s enough, Cheska. I was too occupied with my work. I didn’t have enough time to study. Sorry, Cheska. Which part was difficult? You should have told me. It’s all my fault. I had so many things in my mind. Maybe you need to find time to rest. I can’t. I need to work. Grandma gets worse everyday. We need money for her medicine. I can lend you some cash. How much do you need? No. I’ll do this myself, Thea. Come on, we’re friends. We’re here to help each other. How much do you need? No need. I’ll prepare for the next exam. I really hope so. Stop whining. Look at this... You're sure, okay? Is this real? - Look, it's an 88! - Whatever, you're with your girlfriend... I can't believe it. Of course, it's real. - Whoa! Your score is high! - Hey! Give it back! Give that back to me. Hey! Damn it, give it back! Give it back! - Maybe someone leaked the answers to you. - So what? Give it back! Give that back. Bro, you're so weak! Give that back. - That’s enough. What time is it? - You’re no match to Miss Pusher, Alex. - Asshole... - We’ll all be late. You’re such a killjoy, Gabby. Move away... - Asshole. - What a bitch... And so are you. Bitch! Let's go. Pusher! Someday, I’ll have you. - Those pushers... - She's just playing hard-to-get. That’s enough. We’ll all be late. Don’t be a killjoy, bro. You shouldn’t have given her paper. So, is it really true that someone gave you the answers? You know how resourceful I am. Why didn’t you share it with us? You know that it's wrong. It was just given to me as a favor. One of the Math professors is my client. - But who is not in your list? - I know right. By the way, Sofia, if you need extra income, I know one. Hazel, don’t you dare introduce Sofia to your line of business. Not mine. But yours... Cheska? I didn’t know you had a job. What work? Nothing big. I’m just a plain house cleaner. I’m good at cleaning. And it pays well. - Nope. - Can you recommend me? There’s no vacancy. I’ll advise you when there’s an opening. I’ll take your word. Sofia, you’re here. Have you had dinner? Good evening, Grandma? Who are you? Why are you here? I'm Sofia, your granddaughter. How are your wounds? I don’t remember you. Good evening, Mom. Sofia... I haven’t bought your Grandma her medicine. Do you have some money? Yes, I just got my salary. Thank you. Do you have more? I also need to pay some bills. Here, Mom. Thank you. I’ll go to my room. Okay. Sorry, I kept you waiting. It’s alright. I just got here. I’ll order some food. Want something? I’m alright. I already ate. Are you sure? I’ll treat you. I made you wait. I’m good. - Then I’ll just order for you. - Thea... Just a moment... Thea. Can I ask you a favor? What is it? Can you help me? Of course. How? Well... We're always short on money. And my salary isn’t enough. I can’t make both ends meet. Do you know of some work? Any job will do. What? Oh... You should have approached Hazel. She knows a lot. Didn’t she offer you the work she gave to Cheska? They’re not yet hiring. That’s what Cheska said. I really need a good source of income. You know my work too well. There’s nothing I can offer you, but to be an escort service. Sofia... Are you serious about this? If you need money, I can spare you some. No, Thea. I can’t simply borrow money from you every time I’m in need. My Mom has no work. My Grandma’s getting worse every day. I really don’t know what to do. Alright, I’ll help you. I’ll refer you. Thea... Can we keep this between the two of us? Of course! Okay? Thank you. I’ll get in touch with you if there will be some questions. I have to go. Okay. Thank you. Sofia... Please, Sofia... Stop. - I just wanted to... - We have nothing to talk about. Please, Sofia... Cut it. Whatever you think we have among us, that’s all gone. After what happened? I've moved on. And you seem happy with your life. So, please, let’s not bother each other again. Your drink, Sir. Thank you. What do you think you're doing? I’m sorry. I was stuck in traffic. Sit down. What’s the problem? Sir, I suggest that Miss Rodriguez be expelled from school. The number of drug users in this school is continuously rising. And clearly she’s one of the causes. Selling drugs in school is a major offense. - Is this true, Miss Rodriguez? - No, Sir. But, Sir, I caught her in the middle of a transaction. Will you give us a room, Miss Ramos? I’d like to talk to Miss Rodriguez alone. That woman really hates me. And why did you get yourself caught, Hazel? I didn’t have myself caught. That woman just keeps on tailing me. She has her eyes on me from the very beginning. If that's the case, why weren't you careful? Want one? Sorry, Sir. Don’t worry, I’ll be more careful next time. Make sure. I may not be able to cover you up next time. I don’t want people to suspect. Yes, Sir. Anyway, where’s my cut? Looks thin. Sales have not been good lately. Anyway, just be careful with your deals. Yes, Sir. Lighter... - Did you see that? - What? The ball, he did a lay up. Dumbass, that wasn't a lay up! Hey, Miss Drug Pusher, how are you? Wait. Wait. Why are you avoiding me? What do you need? You... Wait, where are you going? Far from you... Stop playing hard-to-get. - When can I score? - What? Your friends aren’t around. - They won’t know. - Screw off! Hey, bro, let's go. No, I’m tired of her shit. Stop pretending. - I know you like me. - Bro, just leave her. Stop being a killjoy, Gabby. - Someone might see us. - Are you giving me an order? No, it’s not what you think. I don’t like you. What’s difficult to understand? Everybody likes me. Not everybody. Bro, you can’t stand a chance. Get up, bro. Stop whining. Don’t push your luck. - Hello. - Babe, where are you? I’m here. I’m looking for the room. Are you sure with your decision? I'm already here anyways. I can cancel it. I really need the money. I have no choice. Okay. Just update me then. Alright. Are you the girl sent by Thea? Yes. Come in. Take a shower first. How long have you been doing this? I’m new. How did you get into this business? A friend recommended me. Someone was looking for a cleaner. A topless cleaner. And you agreed? The offer was tempting. I needed money for my schooling. So you’re still studying? Yes. College... Do you give extra-service? No. I don’t. Cut the pretense. It’s just the two of us. Stop it. That’s not my job. Please respect my limits. Hazel, why did you book me with that client? Here... What’s that? Your fee... How did you get it? I went to his house. - Why do you have bruises? - That's nothing. I gave him what he deserved for assaulting you. Aren’t you afraid? He can file charges. On what charge? Physical assault? That won’t cost much. I also have my connections with the police. And he’s aware of that. That’s why he paid. Don’t you fear your safety? In our line of work, there’s no room for fear. We only have our courage to hold on to. Don’t worry, I’ll accompany you when you meet your next client. And what can two women do? We can kick each of their balls. They won’t be able to fight back. They won’t be able to fight back. Come on, stop crying. They’re staring at you. They don’t know me anyway. - Stop crying. You look funny. - Look what he did to your hands. Sorry. That’s nothing. Here, take your money. I couldn’t do it. It’s okay. I understand it’s a difficult situation for you. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to face them. Just take your time. Do you have it? Are you alright? What’s it to you? I’m concerned about you. Since when? Look at yourself. If you don’t shape up, I won’t supply your needs. And if you don’t hit your quota, your Boss won’t be happy. Who cares? He has long betrayed our friendship. You don’t even have the balls to stand against him. Let him be. Miss Drug Pusher, is that you? Bro... Boss, what took you here? I just wanted to see if business is doing good. Everything’s good, Boss. How are you? I missed you. Hazel, I think you need to go. It’s late. Damn you! You think you’re tough? No, Boss. Then what? You want to meddle into my affairs? - Damn you! - Sorry, Boss. It won’t happen again. Then? Attorney... Wait, I need to go. I’ll call again. There’s a police officer who wants to talk to you. Who is it? Good afternoon, Atty. I’m Detective Eileen Sahiban. Have a seat. We got this where we found Hazel’s body. She wrote this poem for us when we were in College. I tried to call your number, but you weren’t picking my call. I came to your office, but it was closed. Sorry, Detective. I was just too busy. When was the last time you talked to Hazel? It’s been quite a while. About a month ago? A month ago. We have the phone of Miss Rodriguez. Upon investigating, we found call logs between you and Hazel Rodriguez... a month ago. And you were one of those she called before she was found dead. The last time I talked to her was two months ago... Sorry, Detective, my memory outside work is fuzzy. But yes, a month ago, she asked me for money. Money? Why did she ask you for money? Drugs. Truth is, Hazel has been a drug user for quite sometime. The first time she borrowed money from me was... two years ago? I lent her out of friendship. When it became more frequent... and I saw her condition, I stopped. Did you lend her a month ago? No, I declined. - Why? - I knew where she will be spending it on. Well... Thank you for your time, Attorney. I'm sorry for bothering you. - Thanks, too. I hope I was able to help. - I’ll go ahead. Thank you again. Hazel... Hazel... Hey! Hazel, what happened to you? Hey! What happened to you? What are you staring at? - Who’s with you? - No one. - Be honest. - It’s just me. Damn, are you setting me up? What are you talking about? Are you out of your mind? - Do you have it? - Yeah. Keep your voice down. Open the gate. - Give it to me. - What’s wrong with you? - Have you seen yourself? - Let me have it. You haven’t even taken a bath. - Come on, hand it to me. - Have you slept? Calm down, will you? - Give it to me. - You’re too wasted. Calm down, will you? Do you still get to talk to Cheska? And Thea? Come on, let me have it. How are your friends? I don’t have friends. Screw them! - So you get your money from them? - Why do you care? How do you manage to convince them? Give that to me. They all ruined my life. Here. I didn’t know you’re married. Yes, just six months ago. Congrats! You didn’t bother to invite. Who’s the groom? Well... He’s... He’s someone you don’t know. So it’s true. You married that scumbag. I hope you can forgive me. I was drowning in debt. You can’t fool me. You’ll give up anything for money. Even turn your back on your friends. So why did you meet me? Do you have extra money? Can you lend me money? I'll pay you. Of course. How much? Ten thousand. I just need it badly. I tried calling Cheska and Sofia. But they ignored me. Maybe that’s how it is. Wealth blurs the memory. Hazel. What happened to your arm? It's nothing. Hazel, when will you stop? What is it to you? Thanks for this. I’ll pay you soon. And please tell your husband... Go to hell! I was told that you went out. Who did you meet? A friend of mine, Hon. We just had coffee. Who in particular? You’re full of shit. Don’t make a fool out of me. You met with a lawyer. That’s not true, Hon. Do you really think you can just leave me? And then what, take all my money? Or you just want to embarrass me in the coming elections? Promise, I just went out with a friend. You have no friends. Don’t play your games with me. Remember this, you bitch, if I lose this election because of you, we will both go down the drain together. Are you okay? I’m okay. So you’re married... What do you really need from me? Detective Eileen called. So what? You want us to claim her body? I’m arranging Hazel’s funeral. I’ll take care of the expenses. I just want you and Sofia to be there. We all know that Hazel has no family. She was a good friend to us. Really, a friend? Do you consider one who blackmails for money a friend? Tell me! Maybe that’s her way of numbing the pain. We are all she has. Right? You’re right. She has no one but us. That’s why you keep on giving her money. For what? To relieve yourself of your guilt. Leave me. I won’t join you. Thea, whatever happened in the past, surely Hazel has forgiven you. Screw you, Cheska. Hazel forgave me? Why just me? Am I the only one to blame? I know what you’re up to. I understand your guilt. You just want to feel less guilty. You’re such a hypocrite. I’ll pay the bill. I’ll just get something. Look who’s here, the honor student whom everybody admires, works as a topless maid. Alex, please don’t tell anyone. I need this job. My scholarship grant is not enough. Okay. Really? Yes, I won’t tell anyone. But what is in it for me? What do you mean? What do I get for my silence? What? What can you give me in return? I want something that can make me happy. Hey, Alex, there you are. Good evening, Uncle. So you’ve met my cleaner? Do you know each other? No, Uncle, I just want to take a closer look. It’s my first time to see her kind. She’s a gift from a friend. He wants my vacation to be memorable. By the way, I’m returning to Colombia soon. What do you want? Hazel, can you stay still? Give me the ball. Pass it on. We should have finished the game. [laughing, chattering] That Alex is a real scumbag. Who does he think he is? Hey, Thea, why are you and Gabby staring at one another? Huh? Of course not. Someone saw you boarding down Gabby’s car. What? That’s fake news. Why do you subscribe to rumors? Just make sure. Goodness, Thea, you can be with anyone, but Gabby. He’s Alex’s friend. I don’t know what you’re talking about. - Baby... - Yes? Until when will we keep hiding? Why? My friends are beginning to suspect. Cheska asked me if there was something between us. And what did you tell them? I told them that there was nothing. She asked me to avoid you. Why? What’s wrong with me? - You’re Alex’s friend. - So? They hate his guts. You should talk to him. Do you think Alex will listen? His father is a jueteng lord and... his family is well-connected. I won’t stand a chance. Then why not cut your ties with him? It’s not that easy. When you’re with Alex, you do as he pleases. Why stick with him? We've been friends since high school, and... I never expected him to be that bad. So what will I tell my friends? - Gabby... - Thea! - Oh, my God. It’s really you. - How are you? - I’m good. And you? - I’m alright. Sorry for everything. It’s okay. I know you’re happy with Alex. By the way... What's this? What is this? Hazel is gone. Since when? Last Tuesday. What? She left a suicide note. What did she say? About us, our relationship as friends... Sorry, Thea, but I need to leave. - Take care. - You, too. Damn that Alex! He’s really full of shit. Hazel, calm down. No! He can’t just get away with this. I’ll teach that scumbag a lesson. And how will you do that? His family is rich and has connections. They can easily harm you. Hazel, they are not just rich. We all know what his family is into. Screw him! Cheska... [chattering] Hazel, hold on... No, I’m not taking any of his shit! We can’t just let this pass. - Alex, you filthy pig, delete that video. - Hazel, calm down. Hazel, calm down. Why will I calm down when your friend here is so full of shit? Take it easy... Ah, so you’ve told your mother? Delete that video! Shut your filthy mouth! - Just shut up. - And why would I do that? I will lose my leverage against you, guys. What? Relax. I won’t release the video, okay? Yet. But what do I get? Damn you, filthy pig... Geez... And you’re a crazy bitch... Loser. Damn you! Boom! We need to have that video deleted. I can’t lose my scholarship. I might even get expelled. But what can we do? I’ll talk to Gabby. I ask his help. So it’s true? What’s with you, Thea? Why does it have to be him? Yes. Gabby is my boyfriend. Really now? He’s not like Alex. I promise, Gabby is different. I'll ask Gabby. Hazel... Hazel... Gabby... It’s been a while. How have you been? I’m alright. How did you know? From Thea... You’ve talked to Thea? No. We just met by accident. She told me about Hazel. It’s hard talking to Sofia and Thea. They refuse to join me. They wouldn’t even talk to me. Hazel... Hazel... Hazel... Hazel... Hazel... Hazel... What did you do to your self? Sorry... I shouldn’t have my fear take the better of me. I should have done something that night. I was there that night. What do you mean? I supplied Hazel drugs. I didn’t do anything. I was afraid to get implicated. So I left her. It’s not your fault. You don’t understand. I was there when she overdosed herself. I was there... Sorry... Sorry, Hazel. This is all my fault. Sofia... Good thing you came... You arranged all these? You really are rich now, huh? Unlike in the past, you even had to ask Hazel for clients. Sofia... Do you think this can compensate what you did to me and Hazel? Sofia, it’s not what you think. I just wanted to help. Help? Really now? You should have done that before. Sofia... Look who’s here. The cast is complete. And what did you expect? A happy reunion? Sofia... Please calm down... Just as I have expected. You cover up each other. As the saying goes: Birds of the same feather flock together. You are no different from each other. You're both worthless friends! Sofia, that’s too much. Who would have wanted this? Who? So now I’m the villain. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt... Why didn’t you help us that night? And after? You conveniently chose to be quiet. Sorry... - Sofia, sorry... - What? Your sorry won’t do anything. Sofia, please... - Sofia, please... - No! Sorry... Sorry... - Sofia... - No! Sofia! Nothing can make me forgive you. You will never understand the pain. Sofia... Sorry. You will never understand. Sofia... I still see their faces, hear their laughter. Nothing can cleanse the filth or numb the pain. I feel so dirty. I’m so sorry... Sofia... I will never deserve your forgiveness. I was just so scared that night. You got scared? And what about us? I was so scared! I couldn't do anything! Did you even consider how I felt? How Hazel felt? Did you even think of us? Sofia... I’m so sorry... Everything will be okay... Cheska... Help me close this. Is this okay? Hold this for me. Are you sure it’s alright to drink here? It’s just the two of us. And we’ve locked the gate. Alright. Then let’s drown ourselves. Since when? What do you mean? How long has Alex been hurting you? - These? - Yes... They’re nothing. I just accidentally hurt myself. Really? Come on, Thea. We both know that’s bullshit. Why are you allowing him to hurt you? Cheers! You won’t understand. What’s difficult to understand? That you married him for money? And now you can’t leave him? That’s right. It was Alex who helped me settle my debts. It was Alex who saved me. It may not appear right to you. And I may have hurt you with my decision. I was down and desperate. Is that what you want to hear, Cheska? I guess... Are you happy now? And you, are you happy? Of course. Life has to go on. - Oh, really? - Why, Cheska? At least I did it for my own future. I got the life I wanted. And you? - Me? - Yes, you. And so with me. But unlike you, I only have simple dreams. I'm easy to please. So that is the life you dreamt of? To get abused? Wake up, Thea... Do you think this is easy for me? Think, Cheska... You know too well what Alex is capable of. I can’t just leave him. I’m here. I’ll help you. You want me to believe that? What the hell, Cheska... Thea, what the hell... Yes, what the hell. Have you forgotten? We didn't do anything for Hazel and Sofia. And now you want me to believe you? Cheska... Cheers! You make me laugh... Cheska... Cheska, Alex’s room is on the upper floor. - How do we find it? - Go upstairs. - It’s on the right side. - On the right side? We’ll take care of Alex. I’ll go with Cheska. Be careful. - Let’s go. - Where do we go? - Follow me. - Sofia... - What's with you, bro? - Don't get bored. - Where’s Gabby? - He’s arriving soon... Guys, this is Thea, my girl. Hi, Alex! - And her friend, Sofia... - Sofia, good to see you. What’s your poison? Do you drink? Yes, but no hard drinks for me... - Not hard? - What do you want, baby? I think I know what you want. May I have some of that? Shot... Try this. This is really good stuff. Turn that off... - Hello? Now? - Hey! Where are you going? - Where are you going? - I need to leave. Why now? A client. He’s just around the corner. This won’t take long. - I'll be back. - Do it fast. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Gabby, have you turned mute? - I’m good, bro... He has suddenly lost his tongue. Bro, don’t. She’s with Thea. Mind your business. - Alex, have another shot! - Shot! Cut it. Let’s celebrate. Sure. Who’s next? Here, it’s your turn. I just had my turn. What? - Luis, have you had your shot? - Yes! So this shot is yours. It’s your turn. Cheers! What about you, Alex? Here it is. Thanks. Baby, cheers! I need another drink. Can you get me a drink? Like this. - Like the one I gave you? - Yes. I’ll be back, bro. I’ll be right back. Hey! Hurry, he'll be back soon. - She’s drunk. - What happened here? One down. One down. I got you a different drink. When can I have my chance? What do you mean? Cut the crap. The whole school knows what you do. Bro, I need to accompany Thea. She’s drunk. What did you say? I don’t know what you mean. Cheska... What now? - I have Alex’s phone. - Give it to me. Here... - Okay? - Okay. You can find Alex’s room upstairs. Where’s Hazel? She met a client. What? Move fast. Baby. Be careful. - Are you sure there is no one here? - No one. Just hurry. Thanks. Alex, what are you up to? Stick to your own business! Stop it, bro! Damn, Alex. Please... Do it, bro! Yeah, baby! What do you think you're doing? Back off! Come on, bro! Yeah! Shit! Ma’am, please come in. What is it again? Sofia, I know you can’t forgive me now. Or maybe you may never be able to forgive us. Tomorrow is Hazel’s funeral. Let’s admit it, Hazel has been good to all of us. So, please... Do it for her. Gabby, I don't think they will join us. Look behind you. I thought you weren’t coming. That’s what you thought. Hazel would have haunted us. By the way, I left Alex for good. Great. Finally. Yes, I’ve left the house. Promise you’ll handle my case? Of course, just as I have promised you. You have nothing to worry. By the way, look what I have here. I have Alex’s phone and all his dirty secrets. Great! I also still have some of Alex’s videos in my phone. That's good! Let's upload them and unmask that devil to the whole world. Sure! Let’s make him famous. Let’s do it! For Hazel. For Hazel. For Hazel. For Hazel. Let’s go.
