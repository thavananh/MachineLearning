Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- It is said that our destiny depends on the home where we're born . First the mothers hold the pen and start writing. I read this in a book. Even those who we will love and marry depends on the house where we're born. Isn't that so strange? Even it is your mother who decides your future, not you. When I read this, I said, " This is very strange." Then which house and which mother wrote my destiny? What life am I living, and which one of them wrote it? How could I make these decisions? Please give me the answer to these questions. Can a person change their destiny? I mean, do we have to live the life our mothers have written? Are we doomed? So no matter what we do, do we have to live through... ... the pain we've experienced in the past again and again? Does the pain I've experienced in the past have something to do with these decisions I've made? I was born in a very poor family. My father had a job, but I've never seen him working. My mother was always stood behind us. My mother had three children. Three hopes of buds, she loved us and raised up us that way. I'm like a boat scrap. " The youngest child." That's, actually I was the unwanted child. My brother and my sister were her biggest hopes. Take it, brother. Are you okay? What is written there? Home. Mom, look, your daughter learned how to write. Well done, daughter, well done . But hurry up a little. Because your dad's gonna be here soon. Sakine , I have come, girl. Welcome, welcome. Zeynep, give me some water, girl. Get up, girl. What is this? What's this? Didn't I forbid you from doing that? Did I not forbid that? Are you going to make me crazy? Am I a donkey here, son? - Dad, Dad. - Bayram , the kids are studying. They are not doing anything bad. Are you disobeying me, woman? You are the one who encouraged her anyway. That's why your other daughter ran away with her husband. A 15-year-old girl. You couldn't catch her in your hand and at your home and she ran away. Tomorrow she will run away too, what Mother are you? What Mother are you? Hey, can't I entrust them to you? Don't do this, dad, don't be mad at mom, dad, beat me. Move away, you are already so weak. He is sick, not fair. If you don't listen to me, that's what's going to happen, okay? No more books, no more notebooks, you understand? These books and notebooks won't be open. And you're gonna go clean up with your mom, no more school or anything. You people want me dead? Do you know how hard it is to feed you? Do you know how hard it is to spend on the house? Are you the one who takes care of us? Hey, you. Stop, don't do this, stop. And he talks too. He says, "Are you the one who takes care of us?" look at that tongue. He says, " Are you the one who takes care of us?" I asked for this, dad. I asked to study. Don't hit my brother, don't get mad at mom. Here, it's all here. I won't touch them again. And I'm not going to school either, I promise. My mother's biggest fear was something could happen to her children. Isn't a person usually gets tested with their biggest fear anyway? My brother got really sick because of lack of care. I was making up games and doing my best so that he gets better Remzi, Remzi , my son. Drink some water. I thought my brother would recover if I jumped to the third tile. Will you spit? Drink the water, Ramzi. Ramzi. Ramzi, son Ramzi, Ramzi. Ramzi, son, Ramzi. Ramzi. Look at me, Ramzi. Ramzi, Ramzi . Ramzi, son, Ramzi, please, Ramzi. Please. Ramzi, son, Ramzi. Ramzi, son, please open your eyes. Please open your eyes, please. Ramzi, please. Come on, son. My brother took his books, his dreams, his school with him. And he took away my biggest dream, which was being a lawyer. My dad won. Time has passed quickly. My brother's pain has never gone away from my little heart. The only place where I could ease my pain was Mrs. Nermin's house that my mom was going to clean up . But where would I have known that this house would write my destiny again? My dear Sakine, it's a pity for Zeynep, look, really. If only she goes to the primary school as I have said. She needs help until the university, she needs money. And we're used to Zeynep a lot, and we loved her. We suggest, of course, if that's okay with you and her dad. If only you give Zeynep to us How can a person give up on her child, Mrs. Nermin? No, you misunderstand me, not like that. For her study. We will send Zeynep to the best schools. We'll take good care of her. She will have a nice room and good friends. And she won't live the fate of her sister and brother. I give her, we got rid of you, girl. We shouldn't be stingy with what's gonna bring us much, we should go slow. Oh Thank you God. He said "We got rid of you, girl" It was heavier than the beating I got from my father, it hurt me even more. Maybe what I wanted to hear. A father says, "is it possible?" I won't leave my daughter, I will have her study. But he didn't say that. Welcome, dear Zeynep, come on, come on in. Run and see what's inside there for you. Run! run! Sakine. Her stuff. We bought new clothes for Zeynep. If you want, hand out these clothes to the children in neighborhood. Don't worry at all, we'll take good care of Zeynep. Then I'm leaving. Okay, see you, Sakine. Look, mom. Dear Zeynep. Where's mom? What happened, honey? Is my mom gone? She's gone, but she'll be back in the morning. Mom. Mom. Zeynep, Zeynep. Mom, mom. Zeynep. - Mom! - Zeynep. My child! Don't go, mom, you stay with me. They gave me a big bed, we both can sleep there. And the house is warm, you come too, please. My baby, my baby. Bayram, let's not leave her, please. - It's a pitty, Bayram, let's not give her. - Okay, Sakine, come on. Okay, come on, Sakine. - Calm down, calm down. - Bayram, Bayram. Calm down, calm down. Bayram. Mom. Mom. Mom. Okay. Sakine. If you ask me what is the miracle for you, I'd say it was that day. The moment I entered the pink world. Darkness suddenly turned into a light for me. I have had hope finally. I felt like I was a kid for the first time. I wouldn't even be able to dream of the world that opened it's doors in front of me. Luck smiled at my face for the first time. The schools I dreamed of . The promises , I gave to my brother, now could be fulfilled. As if I had the world then. I even felt like I was betraying my mom by confessing that. I was abandoning the woman who gave a life to me. I left my mother who sacrificed everything for me in the middle of the road, Was I an ungrateful child? How could I have paid for her maternity? I got a big burden on my shoulders. But I knew it, I was going to pay her back for these sacrifices one day. I was gonna study and I was gonna save my mom. The creditor follows up on what the debt and how much by request for follow -up. And as a creditor, he can guide the debt according to the principle of saving. We just got here, my angel. We are done with our lecture today. Calculating the way distance. Go straight for 100 m. Mommy. Dear Zeynep, where are you, dear? Don't ask, mom, this machine got me into ridiculous streets. I'm in the old neighborhood. Is there anyone on the way to ask him? Your father won't order food without you. We are waiting for you. Okay, mommy, I'll find someone to ask now. Don't worry, see you. Okay, daughter, be careful. Sister Nuriye , you become so beautiful, I like it so much. I prepared it. If you hadn't been there, we'd have been destroyed already. Help me. I can't hear you, dear, I can't hear you, come on. I can't hear you, I can't hear you, there's no such thing. There's no such thing. Come on. What's wrong with the patient, Fico?

But it can't be like that, we have to get up, you will be infected with microbes. Okay, we will find it whatever it is, we will find it. Okay, we will find it. Okay, we will find it now, I don't understand what you're calling red. Red, red ... Sister Nuriye, no. My red one is not here. We will find it, we will find it. Master, master. My red one is not here. It is not here. Look over here! My red one is not here. - What's going on? - Wait, we'll find it. Oh, mom. - My red is not here. - What are you doing, sister Nuriye? My red one is not here. Okay, I'll buy you one. Look, you make me sad, your hands are in mud and cold as ice. Look, it's red, and it is very dark red. Dark red. - Dark red. - Okay, come, get up, get up. You are like ice now, come on, Kibrit, warm your up sister right away. What is this condition? She will get cold. - Come. - The red one. Turn on the fireplace, turn on the fireplace, come on. It's mine. Get inside, get inside. It's mine. Help your sister sitting down, help her sitting down now, Kibrit. Let her sit right now, let her sit right now, take off her coat. We have a bowl of soup ... If you're hungry, come share it with us, you can feed us one day...

Kibrit, take this too, let her put it on right now. Is she your real sister? She is considered family. You got your clothes dirty too. No, it's not important, I'll sort it out right away. What is wrong with your car? I have a flat tire. The boys threw something out on the road, and of course since the workshop is close by. And you thought we did it. Kind of. Fico, Yildiz. Check your sister's car, dude. Right away, Master. Our morality is not that bad either. I can't know that. That is, man looks like the place where he lives after all, right? You say that if I'm not bad, could those around me be bad? Kind of, isn't it? There is here too. The kids are still playing on the street here so far. " They are not like those keyboard knights like you see these days" So you need to understand that the keyboard doesn't excel chivalry. There's a mirror here. I will take this then. As if they're doing something really nice. And what if something happens to him? I don't know ... What if they cause an accident? What will they say then? Will they say, " we are sorry, uncle judge, we're gentleman."? Of course, they will say that, but ... What's up, are you a lawyer? How do you know? Look at this, you threw our shop crew in front of the judge right away. It's really weird, I can't believe this. This is the world of children in our neighborhood. People who aren't from this neighborhood don't understand. Really? Where do I belong then? I know this place very well. Weird, really weird. Do you watch series about neighborhoods a lot? A lot, I mean, if man stays quiet and calm here... They will think he's weak. Those who run away, run away, And those who stay either they get in trouble or they get others in trouble. People here are not divided into two parts. In fact, they aren't divided into two parts anywhere, we are all equal. Right, and there's people like you, of course, right? That's, who isn't oppressed or oppressor. Like the ugly king " Çirkin Kral movie", the big brother of the neighborhood. There is still some here. Mashallah , the conversation went deep here. Why was he showing off? Didn't you just call him the ugly king? But our king is handsome, of course. If you've seen " Umutsuzlar" movie, you'll know that. By the way, you look like Cigdem there, it's a nice movie. What was I going to tell? I was just talking about something . I was talking about my master. Master is everything to our neighborhood. Robin Hood, Superman . And you? Me? I'm Kibrit, sister. I work for my teacher. The first time I met a girl working in a repair shop. Don't ever ask, I never met someone like me, but ... The things that happen for the first time, are like this, it makes you surprised. By the way, this is Yaldiz Ali, the other handyman . Yaldiz, this guy, this is ... Come, come, this guy, look. This guy will have an outdoor party in five years, let me tell you this. He's so talented, he's gonna be a rapper. Come on, I'm going. All right, you're all sweet. But what about the school? Nobody goes? Oh, that's, sister, our master took us out of the garbage. We couldn't say, " Come and make us study, too." Okay, since you want to study, let me say this to you, I think that there is no need for such a thing at all. Why? I'm already leaving now to bring some goods. Don't run, don't run, come on, get in, we'll have dinner. Are you okay? Beautiful. She loved you. She's fine, she'll be busy with that lipstick till night. Could you stay to eat? No, it's too late , I'm going now to where I belong. Is it over? Is it ready, my lion? It's ready, master. It's ready. How much do I owe you? You don't owe to us , we owe you. You made my sister laugh, this door is always open for you, please Thank you. My brother Mehdi, the place burned down Shall I say something? I felt the electricity that happened from here. Really, I felt something weird like that. Really. She's always babbling. Always babbling, but can I say something? She's a real girl. People like her don't deal with these suitations this way. But they don't even get out of the car not to ruin their hair. It's so nice what you say, Master, but ... I wish you'd said that to the girl, too. Get in, come on, get in. In my opinion, yes. Get in! get in! I'll sit here or I'll kill you, I'll sit. Oh God Let's start, pour the tea. Look, my dear sister Zeliha, look at the beauty of this . Is she pretty? Look at this, she's a beautiful brunette. Aman, look! look! Now you're gonna love this, look. This girl, she'll fit Mehdi a lot. She has moved to the neighborhood recently, her parents work at the market. The girl is so harmonious and polite. Very elegant, don't ask. Lazy, not smart. We can hardly call her a girl. What should I do? I opened up my entire archive for you. Sultan, don't you have a mind at all, daughter? Will Mehdi look at these? That's all I can do. Wait, wait, you're not running away like that. You promised me. You'll find me the daughter-in-law all I want. You want a bride from the neighborhood. No girl left in the neighborhood. I even looked for all the way to Germany. There isn't, there isn't. It will be, it will be. If I say it will be, then it will be. Good heavens, what are you doing, sister Züleyha? My mother is worried, sister Sultan. We're all worried. Won't Veysi get out of jail now? Mehdi scares us a little. And my mother says let's get him married. So he knows his responsibilities, right, Mom? If the man has a girlfriend in the house, He gets attached to the house. And if she gives him a baby to him too. Mehdi will throw all the weight of the past off his shoulders and look at his future. Now you take this. Find me a bride as I want. And you will get the rest. Why do you bother, sister zuleyha? I do this matchmaker thing, For God's sake, I hope I do you a good favor . Amen. Look, sister zuleyha, this girl is also very beautiful. What is this, like she's going out on stage? Welcome, Ms. Zeynep. Surprise, Surprise. You didn't understand that at all, did you? Happy birthday, sweetheart , happy birthday. Don't look at me like that, darling, this is your mother and Faruk's idea. Look at her face, what did I say? Zeynep doesn't like surprises. Happy birthday, sweetheart. Come on, aren't you gonna make a wish? Come here. Let me make a wish in your place, you, me and London. Well done. Happy birthday. Emine , don't hang out here and there. Okay, don't be late on Sunday, too. Okay? Look, me too. Wasn't there a girl named Zeynep, who was adopted? She had a birthday party, and Emine went to her party. Well ... Zeynep. Isn't Zeynep also counts as from our neighborhood, sister Sultan? She counts. Right, Mom? Who was that girl? I can't remember her. The cleaning lady's daughter Sakine, mom. They gave her to a wealthy family as an adopted girl. Is she counted from the neighborhood? She is not. Why? She's a very pretty girl like water. I saw her yesterday in Nişantaşı, mom. - I swear, she's like a model. - Beautiful. That girl is arrogant, she went to college, could she look at our Mehdi? What does this have to do with that? Didn't Mehdi pass the college exam? He could join the mechanical engineering department of the Istanbul Technical University, too. If all these things hadn't happened to us, My brother would be an engineer by now. Sister Zuleyha, I'm sorry, but Müjgan is right. Where Zeynep sits, what she eats and drinks, they are all different. And, of course, the girl is very arrogant. So cocky and crazy. She's gonna be a lawyer now, too. You won't be able to talk to her either. She doesn't know the big one or the little one. No, no, she won't take shit from nobody. You show me this girl's picture to see. I swear she is not in my archives. And the phone is on charger. She is very beautiful, I swear. Good. Come on! , what's so beautiful about her? Here, this girl does not fit Mehdi. I knew her, I knew her better now. She is the sister of the late Remzi. Good, her dough looks good. I like people like that. Also Remzi used to be Mehdi's best friend. He'll take care of her right away, because Zeynep is entrusted by Remzi. Look, do this thing and it'll go on. This is very difficult, how are we gonna get that girl? Mom, I'm saying it's not gonna work, it's not gonna work. What's gonna happen to that rich girl's parents? You never think about that. Müjgan, you're 40, and your information on life is Zero. I know more than you, what's possible and what's not possible. Mahdi is not like my brother, he's like my son, I almost raised him up. Let's have a word too, shall we? Ill-mannered. I'll take this girl, Sultan. Now go talk to Bayram and Sakine. They will convince the girl and let's have our wedding. God willing. God willing. Tunahan Avcı. Hilal Balamir. Go ahead. Go ahead. Son, I came for Zeynep's birthday, is she here? But this is a private event. If your name is not in the list, you can't get in. No, you call Zeynep and she will say who I am. Okay, dear aunt, okay Say your name, let's see. Sakine, but my name won't be on the list. I'll surprise Zeynep. Just call Zeynep, call her. Auntie.

That's, staying away from Istanbul. Towards Italy ... How is this great boat trip going to be, darling? Kind of, good , of course. Mom! I said if Emine can come, I also can come. You're not mad, are you? No, is it possible? Welcome. Well, I'm not going in anyway. I'll give you your gift and leave. Why did you bother? You are already the most beautiful gift for me. Now that I have seen you turned to this age, I won't be upset even if I die now. I'm very curious now. It's so beautiful. My love ... Why are you here? Welcome. Aren't you gonna introduce us? I'm Emine. Emine. Yes. Emine from the college. The very diligent one, you alway exchange messages with Zeynep. And I always get curious about the sender. She told me that she would introduce her to me, and I started to get worried And you? Is she your mother? No, not my mother. Or is she your nanny? There was a sister me called Kadriye, she raised me up. I likened you to her. She has done so much for me. She's still knitting me sweaters and jackets so far. Let me introduce you to each other Yes , I'm Zeynep's nanny, I raised her. I worked as a housekeeper every day at Mrs. Nermin's house. Lets have you have a seat, come, let's serve you with cake. Dear Faruk, Berk has been looking for you. Please excuse me. Welcome, Sakine. I'm so sorry, mom. Have a good time, daughter. Mom! Mom! Zeynep. Zeynep. - Zeynep. - Yes. Please, please. Please. Okay, come on, I'll convince her, don't worry. Friends, first of all, thank you for not refusing us and coming here. As you know, this is a surprise party. Reh. And now I want to increase the dose of the surprise a little more. And in your presence, I will ask Zeynep something. Darling, not just this year of yours ... Would you like to spend all your future years with me? Will you marry me? She said yes, she said yes. Well done. I promise you, we'll be very happy. Congratulations, dear. Mr. Cengiz, could you get the car? Right away, Mrs. Zeynep. Where are you going, Zeynep? - To see my mother. - Your mother? But it is not possible until the party is over. I'm calling your mother and talking to her. But she's humiliated enough and Faruk doesn't know her. Everything's scattered now. Daughter, we'll deal with it, calm down. I wish I'd told him from the beginning. If only I explained everything to Faruk and my mother too. If only you told me about the party, Or if only you and dad delayed that. How could we know? We wanted you to be happy. Okay, okay, go talk to your mom, and I'll take care of Faruk and your dad. But I want you to come right away without seeing that Bayram, okay? Be careful. Twelve years, easy to say. The place where I learned to walk, the first friendship. The neighborhood, I lived where I lived the first great pain and the first parting . I hadn't come to it for exactly 12 years. The streets I used to know when I was a kid now seems so strange to me. Before one year passed when I left mom and settled in the house of my mother Nermin... ...dad Ekrem had forbidden me to come here. And, of course, my dad was the problem again. My father used to make wound tapes from our lives to cover his wounds. This has become the biggest shame and the biggest devoid in my life. I was going home twelve years later as a guest. And in my mind, there was the same question... If I didn't go there, how would my life be? How would Zeynep have become? Life gave me a chance, but every but every preference is a waiver. I had to give up all my past to become the current Zeynep. Was it worth it? I don't know. It's the question I'll never know. Mom! Zeynep. What are you doing here? Is your birthday over? Yes, I mean, when you went like this, I didn't accept that. They will get mad at you because you came me here. No, don't worry. I'm so sorry, dear mother. I put you in a difficult situation that... I know this can't be avoided, will you be able to forgive me? No way, daughter, forgiveness belongs to God. Mothers don't get get angry with their children. Dear mother. Oh, daughter, oh daughter. Won't you want to let me in? Can I not let you in? This is your real home. It's your dad's house, come on, come on in. Is he Home? Who? Your father? No, he went to the mosque. He goes to the mosque every day after his penitence. Come on, get inside, there's no one. Come on, Come on. Run, run, mom prepared the pancakes Wait, leave for me too. Mom... What happened to this house? There's no TV. The TV's broken. And the food table, mother Nermin gave you, isn't here. Look, mom ... Zeynep, shall we have some tea? Let's drink, mom. Come on. Bon appetit. Hello. Hello. Good work, brother Kemal. - Thank you, welcome. - How you doing, brother? Fine. Get us 10 kilos of potatoes and 10 kilos of onions. Of course. Let's hand them out to the needy in the neighborhood. A lot of people have lost their jobs again this month. Of course, right away. And you, if it's okay with you, put a little. Aga's hand doesn't catch anything, right? Will you buy garlic? Cousin, you're running away, but she is always on your side. Do you have a gravitational set? How are you doing? Fine, you? Brother Kemal, 1 kilo of tomatoes and 1 kilo of peppers. Of course, right now! Take care of her, brother, take care of her. What's up? As you know. Look, girl, look, Mehdi is there. God got him out in front of me. You will immediately go to Mahdi. And you're going to get Zeynep into his head. What? What does Zeynep have to do with anything? Please, don't talk nonsense, mom. There's no such thing. What does Zeynep have to do with Mehdi? No way. Come on, why can't it be? Aren't they both God's slave? Zeynep is single and Mehdi is single. Enough to tell him. Look, I'll say something, do what you want to do, yourself.. ...and don't get me in, Mrs. Sultan If they come to take the house, then I'll ask you if you will interfer or not?" Could you hold this? Here, hold this. Hello, sister Sultan. - Hello. - How are you, Mehdi? Come on, have a nice day. - Have a nice day. - Have a nice day. Watch yourself. How are you, Emine? How are you, son Mehdi? - What is this elegance? - Thanks, sister, thanks. How are you, Mehdi? What's with the elegance, Emine? Where have you come from like this? I came from Zeynep's birthday. Birthday, do you remember Zeynep? You probably don't remember her. Well, my late brother Remzi's sister, his sister in Nişantaşı I camie from her birthday party , that's why. Thanks, brother. Bon appetit. Good, good, I'm glad as Remzii's sister's fine. Send her my greetings. Of course, I'll. See you then. See you, sister. Good work, brother Kemal. Goodbye. Well done, girl, that was a little, but it's a good start . Now it's Zeynep's turn. You'll call Zeynep immediately. And you're going to hint about Mehdi to her. Okay, mom. Come on, then you make them meet like it's a coincidence. Impossibe, I said impossibe, no Why is it impossibe? Working as a matchmaker means to make the impossible possibe. Mom, but this girl got engaged to Faruk Yilmazoglu on her birthday. I thought not to say, but... Stupid, are you saying that now? Did you give me a chance to say? Oh God, look, girl, you're not gonna tell anyone. If the old lady finds about that, she'll take her gold back from me again. No one will find out. Okay, no one will find out. I wish you told me you would come, daughter. I'd prepare pancakes for you. You love my spinach pies. Although I didn't go to the market today, but .... Why didn't you tell me, mom? Daughter, can I make you sad? You have your lessons. It isn't okay, we don't have enough, that's man's situation. I don't get a job like before anyway. Your dad repented but... Thank him, he was a little late. We're old, daughter. What's the furniture for? It's enough with a jacket and dry bread. We're good, we're good . I thought mom Nermin and the others were helping you. No, this has been a long time. Mr. Ekrem was angry with your father, he's right, of course, but... Whatever, le's forget it, Zeynep. Finish your college, be a lawyer . Be happy, we don't need anything else. Come on, come. Zeynep , who was that man who called you " my love"? Do you have a boyfriend, daughter? Sakine, our Hasan.... He's such a poor boy, the water flooded his shop ... Zeynep. Daughter. How are you, dad? Oh, thank God. I saw this day before I die. - Thank God. - Don't, dad. Dear Zeyenp. - Zeynep. - Please get up. If I had three lifetimes, my head would still be bent over for you and your mother. Forgive me, daughter. Dad. Forgive me, daughter Zeynep. Forgive me. Don't worry, my angel, Faruk is with us. I said that Emine felt bad. And you took her to the doctor. And we don't know where the hospital you are, just to know that Come home quickly please. Sakine, what food are preparing? The water's still out. I barely paid for the power. The money wasn't enough to open the water, I'll pay for it tomorrow. I'll pay for it. Mom! You asked me not to interfere, but it can't go like that. Please take this money. You will pay the bill. No, no way. You will get the water back, and if you have other debts, pay it, Please, mom. No way, daughter, put it in your bag. Mom, please. Your mother Nermin will get angry. Is it possible, mom? Zeynep, daughter Zeynep, your mother is right, daughter. Mr. Ekrem got angry with me. He stopped his help and greetings from me, he may get mad at you too now. Don't spoil your tranquility. It's true, I made a mistake. But look, the door of repentance is a door that never closes, daughter. I'm late, but I'm trying to improve myself. Dad! I'll talk to dad Ekrem, You take this money, okay? If it's not enough, I'll withdraw money and bring it, I can even give you my credit card. - Please don't do this, mother. - No way, daughter, - Mom! Mom! - No way, put it in your bag. See my death if you don't , it can't be, daughter, it can't be, put it in your bag. It can't be. Your mother's right, daughter, we've embarrassed you so much. We can't take money from them anymore. Okay, but it can't be like that. You will get sick in this house, winter is coming. The ceiling's already dripping anyway. I'll figure it out, I'll find a way and solve this, don't worry. Okay, my lamb, thank you. I'm going now. But I made you Tarhana soup, it's hot. Daughter, if only you stay a little longer, we'll drink the soup. And have a little chat after, can't we? I'm not going now, but I'm coming again anyway. I made you delicious Tarhana soup, daughter. Zeynep, let's drink the soup, daughter, don't go right away. When I come another day, I'll drink, I promise. That wasn't good, daughter, if only you stay a little bit longer. I'll come again, mom. Whatever, come again, Okay? We miss you so much. Let me do nothing ... You should go, I know, you will come again. I'll come, I promise. Oh, my lamb. With beautiful scent. Daughter, may God bless you. I'll come again. Okay, okay. Go carefully, okay? Come on, come on. Come on, goodbye, my lamb, goodbye. Zeynep. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't tell you what? I tell you everything, Zeynep, you know that. How can you tell me everything, Emine? My parents live in poverty. They don't have any food to eat and water to drink. How come you don't knock on their door? We didn't tell you, Zeynep, because we didn't want you to be sad. That's, when aunt Sakine warned me, what would I tell you? I wish you told me, I'd figue it out. I would help them. I'm so angry with you, Emine. Okay, sweetie, come on, let's talk inside . - Come to talk. - I don't want to go inside . Wait a minute, wait a minute, watch out, Ms. Zeynep. Instead of getting mad at Emine, get mad at yourself. You left your mom and Dad, you forgot them. Can you stay silent, mom? Why should I shut up? Am I lying? Am I lying? Have you thought about your mother while driving your pretty cars? And while wearing your nice clothes? Have thought about how this woman goes to work, and does she have a coat or not? Sakine lost her son. Do you know what the pain of losing a son means? Mom. Speak, Sakine clung to life for you. She sacrificed that much for you. What did you do for her? Take care of your mother, make her smile. But there's no problem for you. If you bury one, you have another mother. Mom. But there's no other child besides you for Sakine. If you're her daughter, take your brother's place who is in the grave for your mother. Otherwise, even I would say, "I wish Zeynep had died instead of Remzi". Mom, Zeynep. Good night. Good night, my lion, what are you doing, sister? Leave it. Leave it. - Welcome, brother. - Here you go. Take it. You pick this up when you're a woman. Welcome. Thank you, sister. Welcome, uncle. Her uncle's rose. Mehdi. Look at me, we got our hands on our chest. I say get married as soon as possible. So that your bride waits for you. Let me look at you. Look. I swear, if I ever find an angel like you, I'll marry her. Okay, dear, let her be a little feisty too, we accept that too. Sister. You... You will be such a mother-in-law You have skillful fingers. I pray to God you don't take the anger of being single out on your new sister-in-law. What does this have to do with that, pretty? That's, if you couldn't deal with your husband's sisters and got divorced... ... it doesn't mean everyone is gonna be like this, right? Shame on you. Don't look at them, Mehdi. I swear, you're fighting for a sister-in-law who isn't even around. Are you aware? But look, you changed the subject again. Look now, I say... If we had a sister-in-law and she sat here, would that be bad? And she'll aslo become our friend, I swear. And mom's heart will calm down. You know how much the poor woman wants this. Dear Mehdi, don't do this, we all want what's best for you. And also before I get older. I wish to hold my grandchildren in my arms and love them, Don't I have the right to raise your children? I swear it is enough, sister. I swear it's enough, you've turned this place into a marriage program. I swear I'm afraid to turn on that TV in the house. One of you will show up in a wedding program someday. I'll find her looking for a bride for me. Look at me, we're really going, aren't we? And we have her picture. We'll go out like this. I think you should be careful. You have a mother inside, right, Mrs. Müjgan? My blood pressure dropped and I got hungry. No one gets in and asks if I'm okay or not And you're also called girls, mashallah. Good night, too, mother. Slowly, slowly, look at your sister. There's no need to rush, slowly. Good night. Where have you been, Zeynep? And you didn't answer my calls. My mother told you, Faruk. Yeah, your mom told me. She said that your sister Emine felt bad. You haven't been around until this hour, seems Emine had a heart attack or something. I'm so tired, Faruk, It will be nice if I get some rest, please. What does it mean to get some rest? You disappeared on the day I proposed to you. And now you're saying that you will rest a little? Zeynep, what's going on? There's something you're hiding fom me. We've been together every day for a year. I've never seen you doing that. You're the most considerate person I've ever known. You can't do something like this. All those people gathered for you, you wouldn't go. If I did something like that, you'd even blame me. Faruk, I'm not ... I know, you got scared, didn't you? The idea of a party was a really scary idea. You always tell me that you don't like surprises. And I still pushed you. And I proposed to you in front of everyone. And that is why you probably didn't wear the ring, right? - Faruk. - I know. I know, I acted without thinking. But what could I do? That happens when I don't get your opinion. And I'm scared. So you're not alone. But we're handle it together, right? Daughter, how is Emine? Dad. I went to the neighborhood. To the neighborhood? Emine... An unpleasant situation happened, my life. I already told you about the case of Faruk and Sakine. How is your mother, daughter? She is very bad, mom. The house is like a wreck, the water's cut and there's no food to eat. They started selling furnitures. I don't know what I'm going to do. I swear, we hid this from you so you wouldn't be sad and you wouldn't neglect your lessons, dear Zeynep, but... I and your mother helped them a lot. Your mother has been working in this house until last year. And I took your father into business a few times. He made me feel embarrassed every time. Yes. Neither your father's gambling ends, nor his alcohol. He exposes himself and he exposes us every time. My father repented, he has not been drinking for months. My father is looking for work. How many times did he repent, I wonder? Your mom's right. Don't look like this at all. Your father is not a man. What if it's true? An old man knelt at my feet and cried. Don't be fooled by these tricks, dear Zeynep. Don't be fooled. Your father is a very good player. Why are you cruel this much? Okay, I get it, you're mad at my dad, but... What's my mother's fault? I'm angry at your mother too. How many times have I told her to leave this man and come here, we will support you. No, that man doesn't stop, Zeynep. He doesn't stop. My mother and dad have been married since they were 15 years old. She stood against her family just to marry my father. The only person she knows as a family is my father. Don't let your man drag you into his bottomless well. It is not your responsibility to save them. Your mother and father are adults. Okay. You're right. I bothered you a lot with my family. But please, you also understand me. You made me believe there is a second chance. Let me give my real mom and dad this chance, please. How? Yes, sir. Great. Our coffee came in guest's cups too. You don't miss anything. Now,... Speak, speak, speak. Wait, let me tell you. Today the grocer Sultan came and this is already obvious from the atmosphere that is inside. You laugh, laugh, laugh. She came, she came, but... Okay. Don't make fun this time, because it's serious. My mom talked to her and they agreed. She will take Bayram's and Sakine' daughter to you. - What? - Zeynep. Who's Zeynep, sister? Today, everyone insists on saying Zeynep. I hope it's good! Are you a gang or an organization? For God's sake, sister. At least you don't do this. How is this? Forget about this. Drink your coffee. Shall I show you her picture? What picture, sister? I'm telling you for God's sake. I don't want a picture or anything. I will not marry. And tell mother Sultan not to hope at all, I swear.. If only you don't cut things like this. My mother has so much dreams about you. Isn't that a pity for the woman? Am I a project? Allah, Allah! You think about it. What am I going to think about, sister? Calm down and think. Okay. Allah, Allah! You already think instead of me. Come in. My angel. If only we talk about beautiful things too, please. Today Faruk and I spoke a lot. We built dreams and plans. Faruk is very excited. He'll open an office in London. And he says Zeynep will enter the master's program. I and your father will rent a house near you. And when Faruk works intensively, we will plan together. I don't know, we go to the theater. You read me books in the garden like before. And we play and so on. What will happen to my mom and dad? They can't come. Will I leave them again? Today I couldn't even tell my mother that I got marriage proposal. Faruk doesn't even know me. These are not unsolved things, daughter. I can't tell Faruk. The more the time goes on, the more it gets harder to say it. He thinks I'm your daughter. You're our daughter too, Zeynep. You spent more time with us than you spent with Faruk and Sakine. Who can judge you for that? Who can blame you for staying strong and sticking to life with your nails? You've achieved a lot of things. Please, leave some things to me so that I solve them. I'll talk to your mother too. We'll solve Faruk's matter over time too. Okay, my angel? It's good you're here. It's good you're here too. I can never repay your right. Since you want me to get married,... ...why don't you tell that to me and sent me a thousand messengers, mom? As it was me who sent them. They are your brothers. And I have one mom too, right? Why are you doing this? Why don't you come to me and say I have a problem... ...and tell me to come and sit in front of me, son Mehdi, even once? Like you would understand if I explained. You will act stubbornly again. I'm already talking to the air. It's useless, as what happened to the case of school. I'm afraid your end is going to be like your father's, son. Because of the burden of the past, you will throw yourself into the fire and burn. Didn't this already always happen? Mom, whoever this Zeynep is and so on, I don't want to marry. Know this, put it in your head. I will not marry. Don't let people get aroused and don't make us a tool for the neighborhood, for God's sake. You're not getting married. What are you going to do, son? Tell me your concern My concern is to live my life as I want, mom. Don't interfere with me. Be fair with me. Am I a child, mom? I'm saying no. I'm saying I don't want. And you are making things up behind my back! Pull your hands out of my life. Who is in front of you is not 16-year-old Mehdi anymore. Let you pull my hands out of your life? And you go and bring the strangers' impudent daughter and make her sit at my table as you wife. I'm not going to allow this, Mr. Mahdi. I'm not going to allow this. I don't want to marry, mom. You will get married, son. You will get married. Your concern is not to make a house for me and so on. You are looking for a daughter-in-law for yourself. But I didn't fit into those calculations in your head at all, mother. Do you know? This has finished us. If your father were alive and told you to get married,... ...you would listen to his words, right? But because I say this, you don't like it. Every time I say something, do something for your own good,... ...that sound like hostility and offense to you. I wish I would die instead of your father. And you would live your life the way you want too. Enough, enough! Every day the same thing, every day the sam thing. Zeynep, good morning. I came to sports. I didn't call you, because you might be asleep. Dad and I talked about the wedding at night. Imagine, he has approved my decision for the first time. Whatever. When my work is done today, let's meet. Write to me when you wake up, my love. I just made it and took it out hot. Not with your hands, brother. Not with your hands. I have brought tongs too, look. You must have missed Matt pies. Right? You haven't eaten it fot a long time. It's delicious, sister. Bon Appétit. I will bring it. Are you hungry, my love? Bon Appétit. The place is closed. Strange! Look, it's really open. And I walked in like this while waving my hands. We're neighbors and craftsmen. But don't worry, I won't stay long. I have news for you. I came to give it to you. But before the news... I hear you're disrupting my business. I won't allow it. I don't need the news you'll give it to me, my goat. Now don't bother me and disappear from here. Come on. Mehdi, come and calm down, brother. Sister, you go inside. Come on, go inside. Do your show. Come, Dorun, come. Let your gases get out, let your indigestion pass. Stay back! I heard you have filed a parole application to get your father out. Do you trust your father at this age? Are you following me? Are you watching my father? Are you so scared of my dad getting out? Don't be afraid, son, don't be afraid. Nothing's going to happen. Now pray to God that my sister is inside. Now put this in your waist. Get out of here, come on, let's see. Mehdi. Look, don't stick your hands into my business. Do you understand? Don't let the neighborhood burn. Mehdi, where are you going, brother? Wait. Mehdi! I'll open. Mother! Zeynep. Good morning. Good morning, daughter. Your mother Nermin called. She said there's something she wants to say. And she called me to clean up too. You probably said that our situation is bad. She might want to help. Besides, I miss your food so much. My daughter, we were going to solve it. There was no need for this. You don't stay in the middle. Zeynep. Is there something you want to say to me? Sakine, welcome. Dear Zeynep, you don't be late for your lesson, if you want to. Your mother and I are going to talk a little. My soul. Good lesson, dear. Faruk's matter is up to me. You don't worry. See you, mom. Dear mom, come on, see you. May Allah give clarity to your mind, daughter. Easy work for you. Thank you. Goodbye, daughter. I hope it's good! It's good. I have good news for you. We're going to marry our daughter now. There's a requester for Zeynep. Is that yesterday's boy? Yes, Faruk Yılmazoğlu. Who thought that I'm her nanny. He's a very good boy. Yılmazoğlu company.... ...he is the heir to them. He is suitable for Zeynep. Zeynep didn't talk to me about anything like that t all. Yes, because I wanted to tell you this myself. Yesterday, Faruk and I sat down for a long time and made plans. And we'll handle everything, the engagement, the wedding and all that. Eh? It seems you didn't like this. My daughter has grown this much. Your feelings have moved. Yes, Sakine. Tanks to you, our daughter grew up and studied. Now it's up to us to establish her nest. You don't worry at all. I'll solve everything. But Faruk and his family,... ...doesn't know the special case of Zeynep. Yesterday you also understood and accepted Zeynep. You know Zeynep. She won't open herself right now. She couldn't say my dad and mom were two other people. But you are also a strong woman, Sakine. There is no mom can really do what you have done. You don't worry at all. I'll solve everything. And I'll explain this to Faruk and his family in a proper language. Then the engagement and the wedding. We'll solve everything. It's... ...will they take us back? Sakine, where these things are going to happen and how they're going to happen,... ...what our son-in-law is thinking and what he is planning for... ...I really don't know that yet. Because the children have a plan to go abroad. According to what I understand, they're moving to London. Is that kid going to take my daughter and go? Zeynep has reached this age. Our motherhood mission is over now. They will establish their lives. Zeynep wants the master's degree. For this, London is the most suitable place. But, Zeynep never talked to me about anything like that either. I thought she was going to start work right away. Work? Please. Don't put your eyes on the girl's salary, before even she graduates. Yesterday you made her feel remorse by saying we're hungry. Please don't do this to my daughter. Zeynep is my daughter, Mrs. Nermin. My own daughter. I didn't even ask my daughter for five cents. She was worried about us and she came. I tried to hide it, but she saw it with her own eyes. You considered us truly strangers. If I sent my daughter to you, I sent her so that you make her study. Yes. Not to take her away from me. Not to be yours. My motherhood mission toward Zeynep will never end. No matter how old she is. Even if she graduates, it will not end. Your mission ends, but my mission doesn't end. Of course, you think motherhood is making her sleep on an ostrich feather bed, right? What are you saying, Sakine? You have to stop there, Mrs. Nermin. I didn't run away from a sacrifice for Zeynep. I have pressed on my wounds. I said "Mom" to you. I said: "Aman". I shut up so she doesn't stay in the middle. Her friends called me her nanny and I said: "Aman",... ...don't let them despise her. I shut up. I'm a very strong woman then. You're very fraudulent. What? You haven't sent my daughter to me for years. Sakine! You made her quarrel with her father an excuse. And you never invited me to any of her birthdays. I've never seen any graduation to her. Now what? You are telling me if am I putting my eyes on my daughter's money? You don't know how longing for son is at all, right? And how to worry about your daughter. You want to take my daughter away from me. You're telling me to leave my daughter, right? The favor also has limits. You're trying to humiliate us with your favor, but this can't be. I won't allow it. Zeynep is my daughter, my own daughter. She can't marry that man. What shall I do? You take the coffee and I'll come right now. Hello, mom. Could you talk to my mom, mom? That's, I'm very worried. Dear Zeynep, it wasn't a good thing to talk to your mother at all. Why? She couldn't stand it and she got so mad. She insulted me and told me insulting words that I didn't deserve it at all. And my hands and feet are still shaking. What did she say to you? She said she devoted her life to you. And we've always squashed her. And she said things in ignorance like that. Why did she say that? I don't get it. I mean, they're a little ungrateful and they're disloyal as well. I never wanted to talk like this, but... Your mom really is jealous of me. Okay, I will go to them quickly. What? Where are you going, dear Zeynep? What did we talk about? You know your father Ekrem will be very mad at this. You already broke the rule once and went home. Please, go along with the man's rule. I'm sorry for breaking your rules. But I can't press on my mother's heart. - Zeynep. - I'm sorry. Don't explode, don't explode, I came. I came, woman, I came. Don't explode. Don't you have the key? No, I don't have anything. Do you understand? I don't have anything. I hope it's good, Sakine! What happened? There is a requester for Zeynep. And Nermin will give my daughter to the son of that rich people. Okay, how beautiful this is. I will have a rich son-in-law, what do you want? Zeynep said that my mother is Nermin and my father is Ekrem. No one there knows us. How's that? Did Zeynep deny us? Why are you surprised, Bayram? It's all your fault. You're to blame for everything. It's you who made me need that Nermin. My lap will stay empty. I couldn't live my womanhood, not even my motherhood. I had three children, three. They all had wings and gone. I was saying that I had Zeynep. And now she is leaving too. I made a big mistake. I made a big mistake. I shouldn't have listened to you. Sakine. I shouldn't have given my daughter Zeynep to them. Even if she didn't study. If only she didn't study, if only she became like us. But if only she was by my side. If only my daughter was mine, If only she was mine. If only she was mine, Bayram. Okay, Sakine, okay. Okay, I die for you. Don't do this. Sakine. What happened, Mr. Bayram? Nothing. What would happen? Sakine is crying so sadly. Zeynep's unreal father and mother gave her. But the groom doesn't know us. Come on, how could they give her? Who are they? Did they have her because they took care of her a little bit? You and Zeynep already paid your dues. This is enough. She has gone, my neighbor. She has gone. My rose daughter has gone. She has gone. Sakine,... ...your daughter will not go. She will not go, if you don't want this. There's something called the right of the motherhood. Besides, Zeynep doesn't give up on you. I die for you. Don't be sad. Look, do you know what happened? I swear by God that you are God's beloved slave. He came like Hızır. "Hızır=lifesaver" That Mehdi,... ...the son of Mrs. Zilan. Mehdi wants Zeynep. Come on, dear? Our Mehdi? This can't be. Zeynep won't want him. This can't be. Sakine, this is our last chance. Don't say I didn't tell you. If you give Mehdi your daughter, your daughter won't leave you. Besides, they have a huge house too. Mrs. Zilan has heard in which a bad situation you are She said let her come and move to us immediately. Look, Mehdi will take care of you and Zeynep too. I swear, I want Mehdi to be my son-in-law. Then you must convince your daughter. You stayed so far away from her and sacrificed that much. It's you who will make your daughter's luck. Aman, that beautiful girl. Don't let the high society take her. Look, Sakine,... ...if your daughter goes this time, forget her forever. She will not come back again. Come on, I will pour tea for us. Did you close it well? I closed it, mom. Come on, daughter. Come on. Don't go soft on business this way. Leave the phone. What shall I do, grandmother? My hands are torn off since morning until now. Mom. What? - Celal broke into the shop. - What? He and Madi fought. And Celal pulled the gun on him. What are you saying, sister? Is my uncle fine? He is fine, you don't worry. That's, thank God he's fine. But he went and I couldn't stop him. I don't know where he went to. Mother, that dishonest, my father's killer,... ...he'll come out from inside And Mehdi knew that from the beginning. It turns out he never stopped tracking Veysi. Oh, Allah! Mehdi. Mehdi. Where did Mehdi go? I don't know, mom. Mom! Hold her, Cemile. - Mom! - Hold her, Cemile. Mom! The woman is going. Yasemin, call an ambulance. Call an ambulance. Get the water from here. Hello. Kader neighborhood. Balat. Mom. Aren't you in the college? Mom, you got mad and left. I need to talk to you. Mom. Mom. Mom, please don't turn your back on me. Zeynep, am I wrong? Why am I hearing from Nermin that you are getting married? Who's Nermin? You're right, mom. But there's a delicate situation with this. You have become ashamed of us, daughter. Mom. You wanted us to be nothing to you. So that Nermin becomes your mother and Ekrem your father Am I lying? You're ashamed of your mother who gave birth to you and raised you. ...who sacrificed her life for you. Mom, is such a thing possible? I was going to tell Faruk everything. But you haven't told him yet. Why? Because you also know inside yourself. That man doesn't suit you. No matter how much you study,... ...no matter how hard you try to be like them, you can't be. And they won't take you into their house anyway. You're still very inexperienced, daughter. You don't know the life. But I come from the bottom of the life. Do you think Faruk and his family will accept me and your father as their relatives? This can't be. It's a fantasy. We barely become servants at their door, we become guards. But relatives,... ...we can't be. You also got mad at me at the birthday, mom. I understand you. But I'll tell Faruk about everything. Actually, he will accept this when he meets you. Please, don't do, mom. When will he know, Zeynep? After the wedding? No matter how much you tell them,... ...their world is different and ours is different. If you marry him, forget me and your father. Even forget your late brother Remzi. We can't get together with them. We don't match. We're different. This can't be. What are you saying, mom? What does it mean if I get married, you're not here? I'm not here, Zeynep. I'm not here. Enough already! I kept my silence all these years so that you become you're happy, I always kept it quite. But you always turn your back on us, daughter. You never thought about me When you were running after your mother Nermin happily. As you were going to study. You didn't say what was going to happen to my mom. And now you're marrying that high society man. And leaving me alone again, Zeynep. Please, don't do this, mom. Don't say this. Decide. Decide. I didn't study as much as you. I don't speak with my mind. I speak with my heart. You marry Faruk,... ...or live with your mother Nermin. Do what you want, daughter. I wish you happiness on your way and your luck. Master. We called and we didn't reach you. My mother Zehra's condition went bad. They took her to the hospital. You have become ashamed of us, daughter. You wanted us to be nothing to you. So that Nermin becomes your mother and Ekrem your father Zeynep, I'm going, you will not be late, right, darling? I even missed you. And now you're marrying that high society man. And leaving me alone again, Zeynep. Look in front of you! Don't you see the red light? Mehdi. She is going to be fine, brother. She is going to be fine. Sister, how is my mother? She's not well. Her breath stopped off. - Mom's dying. - Okay. She is going to be fine. What's the situation? - What's he saying? - I just talked to Mr. Doctor. We took her into intensive care. She's going through an infarction. How? Will we be able to see her? That's, I will try my luck. Let's go together then. But we can't be too crowded there. - Please, you stay here. - Of course, of course. Okay? - You go, we are here. - Don't leave us without news. Sit down, sister. I lied to you, Faruk. Besides, for a whole year. I'm not the real daughter of Nermin and Ekrem. They took me when I was eight to teach me. My real mother is that woman who brought me a sweater at my birthday. My father is a wall master at construction. An alcoholic and without work from years, and my mom cleans houses. That's how we already got to know Mrs. Nermin. They saved my life. They taught me. But no matter how hard I try and work,... I never became one of you. I don't became. I didn't do I couldn't do. I and Faruk waited for minutes, I couldn't even go to him. The only thing I knew was my feeling like I was going to die. Why did you come here? I can't ask a man to understand me. And loves me unconditionally with my roots, my future and my past. I couldn't wait for him to want me after all. The imagination of such love scares me. You are the girl, whom her father told to her we have got rid of you. I couldn't get my mask off. I couldn't wait for another man not to give up on me. And accept me despite all the impossible things. I couldn't get into that imagination and make myself be disappointed again. I went without saying anything, without telling him or asking him anything. Okay, Faruk. I'll tell Zeynep. See you. Faruk is very angry. If only you talk to him. I don't want to. What shall I tell Faruk now? I've prepared your medicine, dear mother. You're going to take from this medicine that is downstairs a day and cut it a day. And a pill every day from the medicine that is upstairs. Don't forget this, okay? Look, this is going to help your pain. Okay, I never forget, thanks to you. What are we going to do about Faruk? Mom, shall we talk a little? Let's talk. Zeynep, I hope it's good! Where are you going? And I wanted to talk to you, dad. I told you before that the case of my mother and father is very bad. My mom's psychology is so bad. I'll stay with them for a while. If your mother's psychology is bad, let's take her to a doctor. Why do you have to stay with them? Because she needs me. And we need you. I will already come every day, dear mom. No, we don't allow you to go, right, Akrem? I feel very stuck, mom. Please, don't do this. And what will happen to Faruk? Are you going to leave him too? I'm not leaving anyone. Please, understand me. I love you both so much. Wow! You already make us feel guilty. We loved you and protected you, Zeynep. Is that what we deserve? It is not so, dad. I gave my mom a promise when I was young. If I don't keep this promise, I don't be mysself. I will feel like I betrayed my childhood. You don't understand the interest we've shown to you. I give up. I don't have anything else to say, okay? Since you're so determined on this decision. Go ahead and go. - Let her go and learn this by living, go ahead. - This can't be like this, Ekrem. I swear, I'm sorry, but there is an expression. You can get the person out of slum. But maybe you can't get it out of his inside. What are you saying? Exactly so. I'm sorry, daughter. You state is exactly so. I'm sorry for you because I've turned you into such a cruel person. I love you so much. Zeynep. Zeynep. Zeynep. - Zeynep. - Okay, Nermin, okay, calm down. Calm down. If we don't become tough right now, Zeynep won't find the right way. Calm down. My uncle Ekrem has a computer too. His library is huge. They will bring books to me too, right? They always go to sea in the summer. They will take me too, right? Maybe they'll also buy me a dress or a coat. Wait, mom, let me put this and you'll be more comfortable. - Okay. - Are you fine like this? I'm fine, fine. Okay. Let's call a nurse. What do you say? Don't keep turning around my head like a propeller. You're putting too much pressure on me. Stand away a little. Let me breathe some air. Finally, grandmother came back to her consciousness. Thank God. We tore the shroud. May God bless you. You waited over my head and prayed. But as you've seen, it's not clear what we'll be tomorrow. Today we exist,... ...tomorrow we don't. Let everyone take his steps on that basis from now on. You scared us so much, mom. But thank God 1000 times that you are fine. I'm fine, I'm fine. Come on, let me rest, come on. Come on. Zeynep. Mom. I came. For you. Don't look at me like that again, okay? I will never leave you, and I will never marry Faruk as well. I'll never give up on you again. Do you understand? Okay, daughter. Okay. Didn't you come? You came with your own flesh. I won't even care, if I die now. What are you doing, brother? Are you doing repairs? I brought you coffee. Yesterday... ...who was the girl that my mother asked for? Whom grocer Sultan talked about. What happened? Why are you asking? Who was she, sister? Tell me. I told you, Mehdi. The daughter of drunk Bayram. The sister of the late Remzi. Zeynep. What happened? Will you accept? How long am I going to live? I don't know how much I'm going to smell your silky hair, daughter. Mom,... ...don't talk like this. Time is cruel, daughter. We stayed apart very much. Every time I tried to reach you,... ...the fate held my hand, my neck, and took you away from you. And I almost couldn't see you a bride too. I couldn't get you out of my house with a veil and a wedding dress. Everything happens over time, dear mom. You don't worry. Before I catch my last breath,... ...will I be able to see you in the white wedding dress, I wonder? Of course, you'll see me. I came to make your face laugh from no on, Sultana Sakine. Let's get you married then. From who? Is there such a candidate? Because we left Faruk. Faruk won't be fit to be a husband. You need an honest man to take care of you and take care of his work. Big-hearted. Such a gentleman. Is there such a person? I'm also curious now. There is Mahdi. Your brother's close friend. The one who used to come here to the garden and play. I couldn't remember, I swear. You'll remember when you see him. Mehdi is the benefactor of our neighborhood. And its eyeballs. All the girls have been waiting for years to get him, but... ...his mother is very insistent. She says let's make the wedding as soon as possible. Did any marriage stay with such traditional arrangements? Without knowing the man and so on. You'll know him, daughter. This is not work that will end from morning to night. Think about it. How beautiful it will be. You'll be close to me. Mehdi has a house too. You may take us to you too. Won't all our dreams come true? You are serious, dear mom. I've been joking with you for an hour. Such a thing is impossible. It can't be. Why? When Nermin wants Faruk, it's done. And when I want Mahdi, isn't it done, my daughter? What are you saying, dear mom? I'm telling you, give me back the right of my motherhood. I never asked you for anything until today. I've lived everything for your happiness. But now I know from my heart. This marriage will make us family again. Please, mom. Please, don't say such things. Don't do, this can't be. I, for you, made the impossible possible, Zeynep. Think of me for once. If only you sacrifice for me once. Fate never made my face laugh, daughter. Will you do what fate did to me? Mom. are we going to talk about this now? How much I loved this sweater. You sewed it for me, do you remember? You loved it, daughter. Very much. It can't be that you are following me, right? I swear, you came again. The neighborhood is ours. This is not that much, but whatever. Right. Of course, I can't belong to this place. But you come continuously. Let's say it's on my way. How's my sister Dorun? Is she fine? She is fine. She even forgot about it. And this is the gift of her life to her. Everything sweet or bitter, it's erased in an hour whatever it is. That didn't really sound like a gift to me, but... You see it as a gift or anything else,... ...it depends on the side you look at it. You forgot this in the shop. Are you carrying it with you? I swear, I thought you forgot it. Like Cinderella. In order to come after you. It's really a very bad joke. Accept this. Really? Thank you very much. This is very important to me. This is my mother's gift to me. Strange. Anyway,... ...I'm leaving. Okay. What is your name? Did you say it? No, I didn't say it. If we ever meet again, maybe you will find out then. Then you are from those who send messages to the universe as well. I think you shouldn't wait. It doesn't come in exchange for messages. See you. See you, master. I wonder how long more are you going to sit at that table? Until this account is over. Sister. That girl,... ...did she say yes? Did she agree to marry me? I wonder if the girl who will say no to you is born, Medhi? Yes or no? Yes, of course. Well, okay, then let's handle this matter according to the procedure. You tell the girl. I will go and meet her. Well, I will do. Thank you, son. Thank you. I was so scared you would get into trouble with the burden of the past. I was living the punishment of the grave. You gave me a lifetime gift by a word from you. May Allah bless you. Thank you to you too, mom. Thank you, mom. It's enough to be there. Mom. Can I bring you a glass of water? Bring. Congratulations, mom. Congratulations to all of us. Emine's socks were torn and you bought her a new one. Who is that Mehdi? You meet him, daughter. See him. Know him. Won't you answer? Are you in love with that Faruk or not, Zeno? I don't know, Emine. That's, in fact, I don't know what love really is. But if there's something I'm sure of,... ...if I couldn't talk to Faruk with this, there's a reason for this, for sure. Maybe my mom's right. Faruk and I are not suitable for each other. And Mehdi? I don't know, Emine. Mahdi is definitely tough and has a paunch. And he can't put two words together. He doesn't have anything to talk about other than football and the car. Ad if you ask him, he won't be able even to say a name of one author. I don't know, he is introvert and couldn't get out of the neighborhood. Someone who just lived lke that. He is purposeless, and he looks like our parents, right? Except my brother. He was very different. Inşallah, she is not so arrogant and crazy, otherwise we are burnt. Now because of the decorations. I swear, if someone, who doesn't know anything about the world, comes, we will be burnt. Actually, I know well people like Zeynep. But you don't know me. That's,... If you say that you are Zeynep, I'll pass out. Zeynep. Mehdi. Good luck, my cousin. Look, son. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. And you? Go ahead. Nişantaşı girls don't drink tea, right? Shall I ask cappuccino for you? Tea, please. dark and without sugar. How are the kids? Fine, fine. If they knew it was you, they would say hello. Actually, Mehdi, I... That's,... ...it would be better, if I knew you are Mehdi, my brother's friend. My mind wiped many things from childhood. Don't stick to this. I have nothing left either. It's life, that's,... ...it's supposed to be like this. How are we going to get rid of this nonsense? That's, do you have a suggestion? Now,... My mother is an old woman. And she gave birth to me late. After two daughters, of course. It means even if it's late, you can guess the weather in our neighborhood. Yesterday she had a heart attack. Really? I didn't hear about that. I hope she get well soon. For the first time since my father died I was scared. Don't they say that the more the person gets older, the more he gets cold-blooded like this? Never. This is nonsense. No matter how old you are, you are a child to your parents. What shall we do? Yes, I also feel this. Since I came back from the military, my mother was looking for a girl for me. So what you're going to understand is what you call nonsense,... ...is important to my mother. It's,... ... that's, I tried to devalue the matter. But this is very important to my mother too. Her tears haven't stopped since yesterday. She comes with the right of the motherhood and comes out with I'm going to die without seeing my grandchildren. Of course. You! Shall I tell you something? Of course, of course,... ...this matter seemed to be organized to me.. My mother also has been singing the same song for years ago. I've been away from home and my family for years. So my neck is a bit bent. And I feel like I owe my mom so much. My mother has suffered so much. That's, when she cries, my hand goes to my feet. I haven't took my head off books since I was young. So that I have a job, make my mother smile, and give her a better life. But for my mother, a white wedding dress and a veil are enough. I'm sorry, I don't understand how this happened. I'm sorry, okay? Grandchild, grandchild. Their only concern is grandchild. Is he sold in the market, I wonder? If we go and buy a grandson. Oh mom! Look at this, from the first day smiling and so on. I will photo then so that my mother-in-law saw them too. Maşallah. Maşallah. May Allah save her from the eye. Away from the envious eyes. Look, look, look. How good they look, right, grandmother? Officially a legend of beauty is born. "Resmen güzelin efsanesi doğuyor" What's this? Hashtag, aunt. Hashtag. Look at these clothes, mom. Is that how people go to the first meeting? Isn't she a little bold? According to her states and attitudes? I mean, look, mom, it's like she has known him for ten years. Sister! Just because you couldn't find someone you love,... ...don't throw mud at people who have a chance to love each other,... ...and be happy together too. Eh? You don't give me tea either. But at least make soup. Come on. I will make, mom. Show me again, my granddaughter with pretty eyes. Show me again Look, grandmother. It's so beautiful. Eh, what are we going to do now? I don't know what we are going to do at all. I felt myself so stuck. My dreams on one side and dreams of my mother on another side. That's, you're going to finish your college. In the end, I know this, that's. You're going to finish your college and do your job. That's, you say I'm not rude this much. You're serious. That's, you're not the kind of guy who's going to marry the girl whom his mother introduce her to him, Mehdi. I swear, marriage, romance and so on are things that don't suit me, okay. But life somehow compels us. It means it gets you into a dead end. And I got tired. The result, what are we going to tell our mothers? Say this to me. What do you mean? I swear, this is what I was planning for. That's, I was going to say she is a witch girl,... ...one foot shorter than the other,... ...and her eyes look foolish, but ... I swear, I'm the same thing, that's,... ...I was going to say how you made me sit with that bull at the same table,... ...I don't marry him, even if I die. Eh, and now? That's, I didn't think at all that I would think like this when I was coming here. But the situation has changed a little to me. I mean, what do you say? I don't believe it too much, interview things without getting to know each other and so on. Is it a sign? There must be a reason for this. God's work. He got you out in front of me in this big city. I swear, I'm ready for this marriage. You're serious. Is there a joke in that? I mean, this isn't a very romantic situation, on the traditional way like this, but... ...I want to surrender to destiny. If you are also ready, I will marry you tomorrow. You also think and decide, if you want. That day he looked at my eyes and said that,... ..."Think and decide." Mehdi also looked at my eyes and told me to decide. As if I make all the decisions in my life. No decision is up to me. I can't silence my childhood inside me. Because once I left my mother and went, I had to give her my life anymore. Heaven is at the feet of mothers. No matter how much you pay,... ...the right of motherhood is an endless debt. Even if you give me your life, even if you do whatever she wants. If your mother comes from an unhappy yesterday like you,... ...you can't make her laugh. Of course, I didn't know those things then. I was saying this time it's going to happen,... ...and it's going to work. And I thought I would make her face laugh. But my mother didn't know what peace and happiness are. There was a pain in my mother's fate. My mother didn't choose to be happy. But I don't want to live my mother's fate. I want to take the pen out of my mother's hand and write my fate myself. I don't want to go through the same pain she's been through again. I want to learn how to love and love anymore. I want to be happy.
