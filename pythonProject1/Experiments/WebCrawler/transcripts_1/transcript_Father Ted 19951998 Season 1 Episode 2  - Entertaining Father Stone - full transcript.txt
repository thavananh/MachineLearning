SO YOU'LL GO, SO? NO, I'M FINE THANKS. I'LL SEE IT AGAIN SOMETIME. TO BE HONEST, IT'S NOT THAT DOUGAL WANTS TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. IT'S THAT... THERE'S A FIRE IN THE HOUSE, AND YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE! A FIRE? YES, I DIDN'T WANT TO GET YOU INTO A PANIC BECAUSE IT'S ONLY A SMALL FIRE, BUT, BUT IT COULD SPREAD. AND IF YOU DIED IN IT, I'D NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF. SO IF YOU JUST GO WITH DOUGAL, I'LL FIGHT THE BLAZE. RIGHT SO. YOU'RE GOING? WELL, YEAH, IF THERE'S A FIRE. GREAT! DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. DROP OF WATER'LL DO THE TRICK! SO, HAVE YOU SEEN FATHER SHORTALL LATELY? NO. I SUPPOSE HE MUST BE ABOUT EIGHTY NOW? I SUPPOSE SO. Ted: FATHER, FATHER, ARE YOU AWAKE? FATHER... FATHER, WE HAVE A VISITOR. SO HOW'S EVERYTHING THEN?

YES, BUT I HAVE TO BE UP AT ELEVEN IN THE MORNING. DOUGAL, YOU'D BETTER GET SOME REST TOO. I CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE OF THIS, TED! I KNOW... I KNOW... SIX YEARS! YOU'D THINK BY NOW HE'D HAVE GOT THE MESSAGE. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME, TED, WHEN WE KNEW HE WAS COMING AND WE PRETENDED TO BE IN ROME? GOD, YEAH. THAT WAS AMAZING! ANYONE ELSE WOULD GO, "FAIR ENOUGH" AND JUST NOT TURN UP. FIVE DAYS IN THE ATTIC... NO FOOD, NO WATER... RATS EVERYWHERE. IF ONLY WE'D THOUGHT OF IT THIS YEAR. HOW'D YOU MEET HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE? HE WAS INTRODUCED TO ME BY FATHER JIM DOUGAN. WE WERE AT A CONFERENCE. DOUGAN CAME UP AND SAID, "THIS IS FATHER STONE" AND RAN OUT OF THE BUILDING. JUST RAN STRAIGHT OUT OF THE BUILDING. SO WE STARTED TALKING. WELL, I STARTED TALKING. YOU KNOW THE WAY HE IS. AND JUST TO BREAK THE SILENCE, I INVITED HIM TO STAY, JUST FOR SOMETHING TO SAY. THE NEXT DAY, THE NEXT DAY, HE ARRIVED ON THE ISLAND. GOD, IF HE'D ONLY SAY SOMETHING. BUT HE JUST SITS THERE. I MEAN, WHAT DOES HE GET OUT OF IT? I HOPE HE'S GONE BEFORE YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY ANYWAY. OH, HE'LL BE LONG GONE BY THEN. WHAT IS IT, THREE WEEKS AWAY? GOOD GOD, LOOK AT THE TIME. I'D, UM, BETTER BE GOING, TED. ANYONE NEED A LIFT? Ted: DOUGAL! (..drunkin' outburst ) Ted: PLEASE, GOD...PLEASE. PLEASE GET RID OF HIM. I DON'T CARE HOW YOU DO IT. JUST PLEASE GET RID OF HIM. DO YOU WANT MONEY? ANYTHING YOU WANT! NAME ANY CHARITY! JUST PLEASE GET RID OF HIM, PLEASE... Dougal: MAYBE WE SHOULD GO HOME, TED. THINK ABOUT WHOSE SITTING IN THE LIVING ROOM. AH, YEAH, I THINK IT'S CLEARING UP NOW ANYWAY. WINDMILL THING'S BLOWN OVER THERE, TED. NEVER MIND. JUST HAVE YOUR GO. GOLF, YEAH? OH, GOD! AH, YES. CRAZY GOLF, PAUL. NOT EXACTLY THE U.S. MASTERS! NO. WILL YOU HAVE A GO, PAUL? OH, NO. IT'S GREAT FUN, ISN'T IT, DOUGAL? OH, YEAH, TED. FANTASTIC! HAVE A GO! NO. IT'S EASIER NOW THAT THE WINDMILL'S NOT IN THE WAY. HERE YOU GO. GIVE IT A REAL GO! WHAT'S THE WORSE THING CAN HAPPEN? (..crackle ) OH, GOD, DOUGAL. IT'S ALL MY FAULT! DON'T BE SILLY, TED. SO WHAT DID YOU DO, PRAY FOR HIM TO BE HIT BY LIGHTNING? NO, OF COURSE NOT. I -- I ASKED HIM TO INTERVENE IN SOME WAY, BUT THIS IS A BIT MUCH. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING OF? WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT THAT BEING HIT BY LIGHTNING WOULD LAND YOU IN THE HOSPITAL? WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? OF COURSE, IT CAN LAND YOU IN THE HOSPITAL! WELL, IT'S NOT USUALLY SERIOUS, IS IT, TED? I MEAN I WAS HIT BY LIGHTNING A FEW TIMES. I NEVER HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. YES, DOUGAL, BUT YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM MOST PEOPLE. ALL THAT HAPPENED TO YOU WAS BALLOONS KEPT STICKING TO YOU! GOD, I HATE HOSPITALS! DID YOU EVER NOTICE IT'S USUALLY SICK PEOPLE WHO END UP IN HOSPITALS? OH, YEAH, THEY ALL COME HERE, TED. OF COURSE, YOU'RE A GONER THE MINUTE YOU WALK IN THE DOOR. I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES IN THE REAL WORLD. NO MATTER HOW SICK I WAS, I'D NEVER GO UNDER THE HAMMER. UNDER THE KNIFE, DOUGAL! UNDER THE HAMMER IS AUCTIONEERING. OH, RIGHT. YEAH. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT FILM, TED, WHERE A MAN HAS HIS HEAD TRANSPLANTED ONTO A FLY, AND THE FLY'S HEAD IS TRANSPLANTED ONTO THE MAN? OH, YES. WHAT WAS THAT CALLED? "OUT OF AFRICA", I THINK. ANYWAY... THE MAN HAS THE HEAD OF A FLY, AND HE'S CHASING HIS WIFE ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND SHE'S TRYING TO HIDE THE JAM AND EVERYTHING SO HE WON'T GET STUCK IN IT AND THAT KIND OF THING. I HAVE TO STOP YOU THERE, DOUGAL. YES? NO REASON. I JUST HAVE TO STOP YOU. THERE HE IS. TODAY'S EMERGENCY. WHAT IS IT TODAY, DOCTOR? I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF BABYCHAM AND HARPIC. PROBABLY ALL THAT WAS LEFT AFTER THE PARTY. FATHER STONE'S BEEN IN THERE A LONG TIME, HASN'T HE? DO YOU THINK HE'S DEAD? PROBABLY DOING TESTS. WHAT SORT OF TESTS? GENERAL KNOWLEDGE? NO. WON'T GET MUCH OUT OF HIM IN THAT CONDITION. NO, NO. MEDICAL TESTS! SO WHAT WOULD HE KNOW ABOUT THAT, TED? AARGH!! THERE HE GOES. HE CAN MOVE WHEN HE WANTS TO! Mary: STUPID BASTARD, YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT THIS TIME! YOU STARTED IT, YOU SLAG. THE NEXT TIME I'LL FINISH THE JOB. I-- AH, FATHERS. HELLO, JOHN. HELLO, MARY. AH, HELLO. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, FATHER? A FRIEND OF OURS HAD A BIT OF AN ACCIDENT. AH, DEAR! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? AH, SURE. IT'S NOTHING, FATHER. IT'S JUST A HEADACHE! I DON'T KNOW WHY I BOTHERED COMING REALLY! IS THAT BLOOD? OH, GOD, NO! NO, I DON'T THINK SO. I JUST GOT A SLIGHT NICK WITH A KNIFE WHEN MARY WAS PUTTING THE BANDAGE ON. IT'S NOT A STAB WOUND! SURE, HE'S FINE. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE BEEN IN THE WARS YOURSELF, MARY! AH, IT'S ONLY A SPRAIN, FATHER. IT'S NOTHING. I WAS LIFTING A BAG OF COAL. IT'S NOT BROKEN... IF IT IS... SURE, WHAT THE HELL! WELL, I HOPE YOUR FRIEND GETS BETTER. THE NEXT TIME I'LL FRIGGIN' MAKE SURE -- SHUT UP, YOU OLD BITCH! THEY'RE A LOVELY COUPLE, AREN'T THEY, JOHN AND MARY? AH, THEY ARE ALL RIGHT. John: OOOOH! HOW MUCH LONGER ARE THEY GOING TO BE IN THERE? WE HARDLY EVEN KNOW HIM WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT. DOES HE HAVE MUCH OF A FAMILY? YES, PARENTS ARE ALIVE... AND HE HAS A BROTHER, I THINK, A DOCTOR IN AMERICA. A DOCTOR, WOW! YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT, WOULD YOU? BUT THAT IS QUITE COMMON YOU KNOW. THE FAVORITE SON WOULD BECOME A DOCTOR. THEN THE IDIOT BROTHER'D BE SENT OFF TO THE PRIESTHOOD! YOU'RE BROTHER'S A DOCTOR, ISN'T HE? YES. DOCTOR, HOW'S THE PATIENT? HE'S HANGING IN THERE. IT'S MOSTLY SHOCK. GREAT! WELL THAT'S NOT SERIOUS! WELL, IT'S QUITE SERIOUS! A BOLT OF LIGHTNING CAN DO A LOT OF DAMAGE. CAN IT? YES. HIS REACTIONS ARE VERY POOR AT THE MOMENT. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT. VERY POOR REACTIONS. THAT'S NORMAL FOR HIM. ACTUALLY, HE'S NOT REACTING AT ALL TO ANY STIMULUS. I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THAT'S ALWAYS THE WAY WITH HIM. LOOK, FATHER, I'M A DOCTOR, AND I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT NORMAL TO FAIL TO REACT TO STIMULUS. I'M SURE IT IS. LOOK, LOOK. LOOK AT THIS. YOU SEE. IT'S A THING WITH PRIESTS. WE HAVE OUR MINDS ON MORE SPIRITUAL MATTERS. SO I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT! WELL, NO, I THINK I WILL WORRY ABOUT IT. OH, GOD! OK... CAN WE SEE HIM? I'D LIKE TO SAY A PRAYER. YES. ALL RIGHT, FATHER. THIS WAY... AS YOU CAN SEE, WE STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REMOVE THE GOLF CLUB! WHY ISN'T HE IN BED? IT'S HARD TO GET HIM INTO A COMFORTABLE POSITION WHEN HE'S IN THAT STANCE. YOU'RE RIGHT. HE'S BEEN ON HIS FEET LONG ENOUGH. LOOKS LIKE A TROPHY. HE DOES A BIT! SORRY, I ONLY JUST HEARD... PAUL! OH! COME ON, MRS. STONE. WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM INTO BED. FATHER, COULD YOU? YOU MUST BE FATHER CRILLY! YES, I AM. OH, GOD BLESS YOU, FATHER. GOD BLESS YOU. (..clears throat ) THIS IS MY HUSBAND, DERMOT. AH, GOD, FATHER. IT'S TERRIBLE, FATHER. IT'S TERRIBLE. GOD, FORGIVE ME FOR USING THE LORD'S NAME IN VAIN, BUT..JESUS CHRIST, ISN'T IT TERRIBLE? IT IS! OH IT IS, FATHER! TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE. I TELL YOU I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER MESELF. TERRIBLE IS THE WORD, FATHER. TERRIBLE. I TELL YOU, FATHER, TERRIBLE IS TOO SMALL A WORD. AH, GOD, FATHER, IT IS. TOO SMALL A WORD. WILL YOU LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO YOUR MOTHER, YOU LAZY LITTLE BASTARD. YOU'RE USELESS! GET UP NOW, WILL YA! MR. STONE! AH, NOW, FATHER, I'M SORRY FOR HIM CAUSING YOU ALL THIS TROUBLE. GOD, FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING THIS, BUT WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IF HE'D HAVE BEEN KILLED? AND HERSELF ALL UPSET! JESUS, FATHER, WHAT YOU MUST THINK OF HIM! AND US, FOR BRINGING HIM INTO THE WORLD! AH, NOW, MR. STONE -- WILL YOU JOIN ME FOR A DRINK, FATHER? NO, I THINK I SHOULD STAY HERE FOR THE MOMENT! FAIR ENOUGH THEN. SEE YOU LATER, RIGHT? AND THIS IS MAMMY. HELLO. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO! YOU KNOW, FATHER, PAUL THINKS THE WORLD OF YOU! INDEED HE DOES. HE NEVER STOPS TALKING ABOUT YOU. FATHER TED SAYS THIS, FATHER TED SAYS THAT. HE WORSHIPS YOU, FATHER. REALLY? HE COMES BACK FROM CRAGGY ISLAND, AND HE'S COUNTING THE DAYS UNTIL HE CAN GO BACK AGAIN. LITERALLY. LOOK. HE HAS A CHART. AND HE CROSSES OFF THE DAYS AS THEY PASS BY. AND RIGHT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CHART, FATHER, IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOURSELF! OH, GOD! AND HE DOES PAINTINGS AS WELL, FATHER! HE DID THIS ONE FOR YOU! OH, LORD! OH, GOD! WHAT IS IT? IT'S HIS HEART! DO SOMETHING! OH, OH! DOUGAL, DOUGAL! DOUGAL! Doctor: MRS. STONE, WOULD YOU COME WITH ME! I NEED YOU TO FILL OUT SOME FORMS. IS HE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT? WE'RE DOING ALL WE CAN, BUT HE IS QUITE ILL. JUST HOPE FOR THE BEST. Mrs. Stone: ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR. COME ON, MAMMY. THE OLD WOMAN, SHE KNOWS IT'S ALL MY FAULT! HOW WOULD SHE KNOW THAT? THEY HAVE WAYS! ALL WOMEN ARE CLOSER TO GOD THAN WE'LL EVER BE. THEY GET TO THAT AGE, AND THEY DON'T NEED THE OPERATOR ANYMORE. THEY'VE GOT THE DIRECT LINE. SHE KNOWS ALL RIGHT... WHO COULD BLAME HER FOR BEING ANGRY WITH ME. IT'S ALL MY FAULT! WHY DID I DO IT? OH, GOD, PLEASE... BRING HIM BACK! I NEVER MEANT TO TAKE HIM AWAY! THERE WAS NO NEED FOR THE LIGHTNING! YOU KNOW I DIDN'T MEAN THAT! THAT WAS JUST SILLY! PLEASE... PLEASE, GOD, BRING HIM BACK, AND I SWEAR WE'LL LOOK AFTER HIM. HE CAN STAY AS LONG AS HE WANTS! OH, NO, TED! SHUT UP, DOUGAL! PLEASE, I SWEAR! I'LL LOOK AFTER HIM THE REST OF MY DAYS. JUST DO THIS ONE THING! AH, COME ON, PLEASE! PLEASE... I SWEAR, I'LL -- PAUL! YOU'RE BACK! OH, LORD, IT'S A MIRACLE! DOCTOR! PAUL...
