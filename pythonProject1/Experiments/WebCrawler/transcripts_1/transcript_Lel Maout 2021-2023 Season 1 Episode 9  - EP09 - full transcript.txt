Where is the child, Sahar? Where is it? I buried it. It was born dead. EPISODE 9 Basil. Basil. Basil. Basil. Basil. Basil. Basil, Basil. Basil, Basil. Basil, Basil, Basil! What do you want? You scared the hell out of me, man! What do you want? What is the matter? What is this? What is this? -They are pills. -I know that. But I thought you were not taking pills anymore, that you stopped taking them. Why are you taking them again? When I am tired and can't sleep, I take a pill. How many pills did you take already? Because you can barely wake up. -I don't remember, I forgot. -You forgot? What does that mean? Tell me. Enough, Hadi, leave me alone. I want to sleep. Get up, get up. Get up now, take a shower and freshen up. We have to go to the office, and there we can talk. -Come on. -I don't want to talk! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! I don't want to talk! I don't want to see anybody! -Just calm down. -Don't tell me to calm down. Don't tell me to calm down! You of all people! For the hundredth time, don't worry about me, bro! Let me be. I am not a child, don't treat me as such! -I'm not a child! -I'm not treating you as a child. But I don't want what happened before to happen to you again, try to understand. -Get out! Get out! -Okay, I won't say anything. Get out of here! Get out, I don't want to hear anything or anybody, get out. I beg you, leave me alone! Leave me alone! -Good morning -Omar... Give me Sahar's Lebanon number. What is the matter? Tell me. I have to save my brother quickly, before he goes back to how he was before. And to the antidepressants. And to the state of depression that he was in. Frankly, I don't want him to become suicidal. Please send me Sahar's number, I want to talk to her. Okay, I will. What do you intent to do? -Hello -Hello, Sahar. -What do you want? -We have to talk. There's nothing to say, I ended my relationship with your brother. Frankly, I am emotionally very exhausted. Yes, darling. Come on, ring me again. I don't have time for that. WhatsApp is not bad. Sahar, we must meet and talk. I must see you. I have to, please. Hadi, there is nothing to say. There is a lot to say, Sahar. I'm telling you, we have to talk. PLEASE ANSWER ME I WANT TO SEE YOU. What are you looking at? Nothing, madam. Nothing. Get out of here. There's a lot of dust, let me finish cleaning. I'm telling you to get out. Would you like me to make you some herbal tea... Get out, Mona, and shut the door behind you. Hello, little girl! -Where are you? -In my car. I have an appointment with Hadi. I am going to see him. Are you okay? Is there a problem? Not at all, I want nothing. Sahar. Whatever you do, it won't happen. Some advice, from a sister to her sister. Don't overdress because... my husband doesn't like the showy dresses. He likes the simple things. Don't worry, I put on something simple. I know his taste now. I'm sure he will like it. But darling, what about our second outing? What do you advise me to wear? Black, like your inner being. Don't worry, you already bought all of the Zaarour building. The building next to it has also been bought. But there's an apartment in it for someone from the Assi family, he is abroad. I know him, but I'm unable to reach him. I contacted his cousin. And I enticed him with some money in case he manages to convince him. Some money? How much do you mean? Not a lot, it's okay. Amine. I hope you're not putting money aside for your own pocket. God forbid, what are you saying? It's all written and documented. All right, what else? The building where Abdallah's mart is located. Yes, he's the pest of the neighborhood! This also can be solved. I spoke to his cousin and promised him a good bribe. -More money to pay, Amine? -It's not a lot. We have to do our business. I convinced him that there is a new plan for the neighborhood. And that the road will pass from there and it's better for him to sell. But beware, the last person you talk with is Abdallah. I won't get into more details with you. I will let you do your work. -So that you know that I trust you. -And I will earn your trust. You must earn my trust, we will become a family! -Or maybe you think not? -Surely, we will. I can't refuse to become the father-in-law of Jaber Jaber. But we have to talk about the dowry. -How much are you going to pay? -Amine? Amine, do you want to sell your daughter too? No, Mr. Jaber, what are you saying? I am talking about the Sharia. Do you consider the Sharia only when it suits you? -Hey, babe. -Did you get to the office, darling? Yes, I did. Tell me, is something the matter? No, but I want to ask what you'd like to have for dinner tonight? I don't mind, whatever you choose, darling. Will call you later because I have clients. -Okay. -Bye now. -Hadi... -Yes, babe? I love you, don't forget that. Me too. Bye. Sonia told me that you were here. I came to say hi. Damn you, get out of here! Wejdan... I apologize. -I am sorry about it all. -Don't come even close to me! Get the hell out! You are right to be upset with me, I made a mistake, but... There is no "but" in these situations. You can't justify what you did. Especially when you know very well what I have been through in my life. Especially on this subject. It is true, yes, you are right. I was an ass, a dog, whatever you may call me. -What else do you want? -I want you to leave me alone, you animal! Stay the hell away from me and let me be. You think that this easy for me? I am not able to live without you. -I can't breathe without you. -To hell if you can't breathe! That would be better for both of us. -Come in, Sonia. -Your coffee, ma'am. Thank you, but I have to go. It seems Hadi will be late. -Bye, Omar. -Bye, ma'am. Come and visit us. Why did you want to see me? Frankly, I wanted to apologize for the things I said at dinner. I was confused. You have the right to be mad at me. But honestly, I didn't know what to do. And now you're not confused anymore? You know what to do now? I mean at least... I know what I must do. Sahar, I want to ask you a question. I wish that you'd answer me frankly. I have come to listen to you. What does Basil mean to you? What do you want from him? -Why do you want to know? -Because Basil likes you a lot, a lot. What does that mean? Does that bother you? Frankly, this scares me. It makes me concerned about my brother. My brother Basil is fragile. He's been through a very difficult situation. After his wife's death. And frankly, I didn't see him happy and comfortable until after he met you. What are you trying to tell me? If you have feelings towards Basil... go back to being with him. Don't let what happened between us affect your relationship with him. Really? -Are you really asking me to do this? -I know what I'm asking is strange. But since we agreed that what happened between us was a mistake, and we will forget it, and no one will know about it, I have no problem. What happened between us was not a mistake. At least from my side of things. When I came back to Lebanon, yes, I discovered that it was mistake. Because I met Basil. I blamed myself. If I didn't know you, perhaps, I would have been with him right now. Do you know why? Because I don't know how and why this person entered my mind. And the person that enters your mind is so difficult to forget. But the one that enters your heart... he might get out as if he was never there. PRIVATE NUMBER If you want you can answer it. It doesn't matter. No problem. This means that we're agreeing on what happened between us was a mistake. We agreed. But are you sure that you have no problem if Basil and I were together? To be honest with you, had Basil not been in this special situation... and had you not been attracted to each other, I would surely have a problem. And if we didn't want to forget the past, you and I, I was going to have a problem for sure. But I am asking you right now. Give Basil and yourself a chance. Please. -Money, money, money... -Enough, Omran! Get away from me! Damn him, he's such an animal. Hey, beautiful lady, look at me. Oh gosh, it's you, the stingy one! What bad luck! Damn me, damn my parents! Damn everything about me! This is not important right now, take this prescription. -What is this? -It's because my mom has diabetes. Didn't you tell me that your mom is dead? -I mean for my father. -Didn't you say that your father left you? He came back! So what? What is the matter? Why are you looking at me like that? Why? Take it, come on. Don't waste my time. If you don't want to give me anything then don't waste my time. -What do you want now? -Calm down. Do you have parents? I knew you were going to waste my time, you see? I'm asking you. Do you have a mother, a father, a family? No, I have no one. When are you going to give me money? -I'm not going to give you money. -I want money. But what is the other option? I will take you to the orphanage. And I will give you a house and a family. What a day this is, God! Look, if you give me 20,000, that would be better. Stay here, don't go. I'm not leaving before you give me the 20,000. Hello. They say the third try is the successful one. I don't get it. You called him twice from a private number to see if he was going to answer you. But he didn't answer because he was with me. Now you can try and call him again because he left. What happened to the 20,000? Come on, I'm waiting. Yes, Sahar. Frankly, Basil, I couldn't sleep all night, I was thinking about you. Sometimes being hasty is not wrong, it leads to the right decision. It makes us live in the moment without fear and without any care in the world. What does that mean? It means that it's up to you to decide to live in the moment without fear. And to let our feelings take us wherever they want to. Can I see you in the evening? It depends on how clever you are, try to entice me and we'll see. If I told you that, yesterday I couldn't sleep until sunrise. Would you accept? I was a little bit convinced, but you should try harder. And if I told you that, I won't sleep tonight unless I get to see you? No, this is too much. You know I am concerned about your health. So pick me up from my house at nine o'clock. An outing would be good because I'm bored, and then we can have dinner together. But now it's almost night. Can I come over and meet you? Please don't embarrass me. Don't be later than nine o'clock, I'll be waiting for you. I don't understand why would she pay that much. For a driver? If it wasn't for me, she wouldn't have paid you that much. If you weren't my husband, you wouldn't even dream of this amount of money. And there are also the tips. Super! Life is treating you well, Amine! I will be cashing a bank manager's salary. So that you'd know how useful your wife is to you. I wish you are good to me as half as I am good to you. You will benefit from me, you will, more than you can imagine. But not in thousands but in hundreds of thousands. I know all your history. Where would you get this kind of money, you broke fellow? -From Jaber. -You've got a nerve! I told you this is my house and I don't want to sell it. Who said anything about the house, stupid woman? So what is it? Jaber wants to marry Lamees. Jaber? No! -Really? -Yes. And he said he is ready to pay any amount we want as a dowry. What about the wives he already has? Would he divorce them? Why would he divorce them? The Sharia allows him to marry four women if he is fair to all of them. How much is he going to pay? -How much do you want? -I don't know? I have to think about that. But you have to promise me not to say anything to Lamees before it's definite. Let her finish her exams. What's the use of the exams and the certificate, anyway? We were educating her so she'd get a job and help us. And to be able find to a nice man, but we already got one now. We need to quieten down. We should prepare for everything, and we will tell her a week before the wedding. Because Lamees is in love with this tiny guy, Rasheed. -What is this? I am going to beat her up! -Calm down. Let me handle this, and you can back me up when I talk, sit down. Lamees, darling. Oh, darling, give me this, come inside and sit down. Amine, have Lamees sit at the head of the table. Come, darling, come. Only a luxurious life would suit Lamees. -Is there something up? Are you okay? -My darling, you are my darling. I am going to feed you myself. I have a surprise prepared for you. Your father gave me some money to take you shopping for some clothes. I will bring you everything you need. -Really, Dad? -Of course, my darling. Bring her everything. Whatever she desires. Lamees has become a young woman, and she is ready to be married. You are shy, my sweetheart. Make her a sandwich. I will cook you your favorite dish. I'll cook it right now. Stay with your dad. Feed her! My darling, eat. Let me take this, Mr. Hadi. -Thank you. -You're welcome. -Where to? -I'm going to see Sahar. -This means you're back together. -Yes, and I am so happy. What is this? Nothing just a minor accident. Don't worry. Basil, what about the medication I saw next to your bed? Will you keep taking it? No, I take this medicine when I'm tired and can't sleep. But forget about it now. Bye now. I missed you, you were so late today. The work was so intense, darling. -What did you do? How was your day? -Fine. I spent my day at the office. I'll go and freshen up. I asked you more than once, but you're ignoring my question. What is the reason behind the wound on your hand? I told you, nothing important. Just a minor accident at work. Nothing more. Although, your answer didn't convince me, I wish you'd tell me. Thank you, and thank you for your concern. Don't mention it. Sahar. Would I be rushing things if I told you that you've woken up many things inside of me that I had forgotten long ago? No. You'd be too late. What's wrong? Nothing, I'm waiting for you to talk. And say what? Where have you been today? And what did you do? Where would I be? I was at the company all day long. This is strange, because I went to the company today and I didn't find you there. And I called you from the office and you told me that you were there. But you weren't. Why are you lying, my darling? Where have you been? I was with Sahar. -Sahar? -Yes, Sahar. I took her number from Omar. I had to see her... and talk to her about Basil. -Didn't they break up? -Yes they did. That's why I had to see her and ask her to be with him again. Basil loves her so much. He is so attached to her. But as I understood from her, she is afraid of commitment. And afraid of her feelings. I don't know. Anyway, I saw her, and I asked her to come back to him. -Nice, and what else? -I asked her to give herself a chance. And to give Basil a chance as well. Frankly, I didn't tell you, because I didn't want Basil to know. That I had anything to do with this. Especially now that they are back together. For a moment, I thought you are cheating on me. You're crazy. You know if I discovered that you betrayed me once... and that it was a mistake, I can forgive you. Just once, not twice. Do you understand? Don't worry about that. Things change. It's God's will. We were comfortable in this job. But it seems we will always have dinner invitations from now on. Quit nagging or you'll bring bad omen on the residents. Bad omen? Why is that? Do I look like a witch with crooked teeth? -Did you see my teeth? -Yes I saw them. It's good. -Sariah. -Yes. It's almost noon, where is your missus who wanted to see me? Why would she see you? That's not what she said. She said you should come and start work at once. So now you're at work. Take this banana and eat it. It is forbidden for the drivers to enter the kitchen. As you wish. There's a lemon there. Smell it. The strange thing is that we already have a driver whose name is Fahed. What would they want with your husband? Can't you just see me happy? No, darling, on the contrary, I am happy for you and for your husband, -but this is strange -Not strange at all, Mona. When God wants to bless somebody he will bless him. The proverb says, "If you don't know the address of your spoils, your spoils know your address." What is it, little one? You visit quite often nowadays. It seems you are missing me a lot. Are you playing a game saying that you were with my husband yesterday? Am I playing a game? Didn't you call him twice yesterday from a private number and he didn't answer? Would I lie? I called him twice and he didn't answer. I admit this. But you, Sahar. When you want me to believe he was with you, at least put some perfume on his shirt because I didn't buy this one. It's not the first time we've played this game. Please forgive me, we were in a hurry. I didn't have time to do that. Who are you fooling, Sahar? If you don't believe me, then don't. You have a good heart. Admit that he loves me. Admit it. If not, he wouldn't have asked to see you and beg you to go back to his brother. Imagine, he told me everything. I'll make some coffee, perhaps. Meanwhile, you can recover from the shock. I'm your student. By the way, I congratulate you. It's very powerful that you left Basil to convince my husband that you are a woman of principles. And let my husband convince you to go back to his brother. I like it, it's a great move! You need to do a lot more to match me, little one. You are right. Do you know why? Because even in war, I have red lines that I don't cross. You are my sister and my darling. But business is business. We had agreed that "All is fair in war." Is it fair for a sister to have an agreement with someone to rape her sister so that she could put pressure on her? What are you babbling about? What are you talking about? What am I babbling about? I always knew that you were dirty but not to this extent. But don't worry. Your filth is nothing compared to mine when I decide to let loose. And I have decided now. I don't have red lines anymore. You and that animal Omar will pay a heavy price for what you did to me. Did Omar rape you? Keep on playing your game. Shed a tear, or maybe change the tone of your voice. Perhaps, I would believe you more. -Who are you fooling? -Are you crazy? Why would I agree with Omar on something like that? Why wouldn't you? -What hinders you? -What hinders me? You know very well what hinders me. Is it possible that I'd put you in the same situation that we went through when we were little? Don't think about yourself, think about me. Is it possible that I'd put you in the situation that made my mother kill my father and kill herself and throw me in the orphanage? Would I, Reem? Would I hurt you in such a manner? -Me! -You're the one who keeps on hurting me much more than that. Look, the raping is not something new to me. But the lack of fidelity from the closest person to me, this is something new. By the way... get dressed, you are invited to dinner tonight over at my place. You are such a dog, you have always been a dog and you will remain a dog. -At least the dog is more loyal than you. -Yet he remains a dog! An animal! And still follows his desires. How could you do this to Reem? How could you do this to Reem? How could you rape her? I didn't rape her, I took what's mine. I have always taken from her what's mine, and she was pleased about it. You are a sick person. You have complexes, you're a block of complexes. If I am like that, then what are you? You think you are better than me? What do you call the thing that you did with Wejdan? What do you call it? I am protecting her, you low life! I am doing everything for her own good. You only care about your own benefits. You want Wejdan to remain by your side in order to take his money. Because you are a hungry person who cannot be satisfied. An opportunist. You call me an opportunist, you dirty addict! Listen carefully to what I'm about to tell you. As of this moment, you're out of the game. -Sit down. -I wanna be out of the game, anyway. And me going to the Hadi's house proves that. If I ever want to expose you. Come on now, get the hell out of here. Get out! Listen, pal. Keep in mind that if you say a word in front of Hadi and Basil, I will make you pay a heavy price. -Are you threatening me? -Of course. Of course, I am threatening you. It's very obvious. And you know very well what happens when Sahar makes a threat. I am neither Basil nor Hadi. I am Omar, and you know me very well. We are both in this. Isn't that right, pretty girl? Lower the volume. Music is forbidden here. And take this sandwich. Eat it. Take it. Hide this bottle of wine in the glove compartment. What kind of job is this, Sariah? I don't like it. You don't like it because you are not used to earning 2000 dollars every month. Look, Amine, if you can't find a way to make your living, then I know it -very well. -Damn you. Does she want to enslave me with the salary she is giving me? I am left alone all the time, and you know that I am not a patient man. You won't always be working at night. It depends on the work. What kind of work are you talking about? I'm sitting here all the time. -I'm not doing anything. -What more can you wish for? Sit and relax, and get 2000 dollars cash. I exhaust myself to earn half of this amount. She's coming. And you're gawking at her. Get out. Get out, come here, come. -What is it? -Let me tell you what it is. Raise your hands. What are you doing? Damn you, give me this. Go ahead in front of me. Mrs. Reem, this is my husband that I told you about. -Good evening, ma'am. -Hello. Basically your shift will start at ten o'clock in the morning. Unless I have no need of you. Then you don't come. And you will have a day off. And sometimes I will need you in the evening, like today for example. So you don't leave this place unless I tell you. -Understood? -Understood, ma'am. And you, go easy on the perfume because I'm choking. You kept spraying the perfume until you caused us trouble. But she is so pretty. Watch your tongue or I will rip it out of your mouth. -She is cruel. -Yes, you're right, she is cruel. But she is our resource. Come! Get down, get down, don't say a word! What is the matter? What is going on, guys? Where are you taking me, guys? Wait, guys! -Thank you. -Good evening, Miss Sahar. You're unbelievable, Basil, you do this every time. I'm happy this evening. I won't hide it. Welcome to our house, Sahar. You've lit it up. -Thank you so much. -Come in. Basil, as of today, Sahar should have dinner with us every evening. -That's it. We really loved you. -And I loved you too. It's good you said it. It's the first time I've heard it. No, she said I loved all of you. Not just you. Thank you for the explanation. Your brother is late. Would you go up and rush him a bit? Okay. Come in, Sahar. What can I say to make you believe, that I have nothing to do with what happened between you and Omar. The problem is that you have no credibility at all. I swear on your life, Reem. That's nice of you. I even went to Omar. And we had a fight because of it. I'm swearing on your life. No matter what you say, I won't believe you. I swear by your dead daughter. I swear by your dead daughter, Reem. She was a girl? I drink for this nice gathering. And I drink for the man I fell in love with at first sight. The man I never imagined that would love me this much. The man that I want to continue all my life with. And grow old with him. The man that nothing would separate me from except death. Till death. Yes, babe, till death. -Why are you in such a frenzy, Amine? -I'm warming my body because of the cold. -Are you done? -Yes, I'm done. Take me home and come back. No, I can't. The lady told me not to leave my place. It's my first day at work, and I don't want to mess things up. Especially, now that she's giving me such a big salary. You walk up the street. Find a taxi and go. You are so stupid. And it seems like you have high fever as well. The least you can do is drive me up the street. Then you can go back to your lady. Hey, man, how much do you want to take for a ride? I can't get enough of all of you, but I'm already late. -Shall we go, Basil? -Yes, after you. You could've stayed a little longer. The night is still young. -We will make it up to you another time. -Hopefully. I was thinking maybe we can spend the weekend together in the chalet? -What do you think? -Whenever you want. -I have no problem. What do you think? -Of course. -That's a deal. -Then it's a deal. Thank you. After you. Siham, please bring me my shawl. -Thank you all for the dinner. -You're welcome. Good night. -It's a chilly night. -Yes, it is. -Fahed? -At your service, Mr. Hadi. Come here. -Whose car is this? -This is Amine's. Who is Amine? Sariah's husband. I hired him because they need money. I'll tell him to go. -Your shift is over, you can go now. -Sure. What is the situation with this man? -Do you know anything about him? -I know nothing about him, sir. Today was his first working day. Until here and our evening is over. Let me stay a while. No. -Good night. -Good night. He's sticking to me like gum! Basil, what... Is it possible that you were closing the door in my face? Didn't you miss me? Didn't you miss your brother? You didn't ask about me? It's all right. But at least ask about the girl that you forced me to raise for 17 years.
