I'D CALL HER BEAVER-TEETH RIGHT TO HER FACE. I'D BACK OVER HER WITH MY STATION WAGON AND CRUSH HER SKULL. I'D CHOP HER UP INTO TINY PIECES, PUT THEM IN FREEZER BAGGIES... THEN I'D FEED HER SLOWLY TO CHIPMUNKS. ( chuckles ) NO, GOLDFISH! ( chuckles ) NO, NO, CHIPMUNKS! ( laughs ) THAT'D BE REALLY GOOD!

( laughs ) ( grunting ) ( animal noises ) ( car alarm beeps ) Man: PICTURE YOURSELF IN A BEVERLY HILLS RESTAURANT, WAITING FOR LENORA BABBITT. WHEN LENORA BABBITT CUT OFF HER HUSBAND'S JOYSTICK WITH A CARVING KNIFE, SHE BECAME THE SCARIEST WOMAN IN AMERICA. WELL, AFTER MADONNA ANYWAY. LENORA WAS 5'2" OF TERROR. SO I FIGURED IT'D BE SAFE TO MEET HER IN A PUBLIC PLACE. I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS, BUT I THINK I HIT IT PRETTY WELL. SIR, UH... CAN I BRING YOU SOMETHING WHILE YOU'RE WAITING? YEAH, I'LL HAVE ANOTHER DOUBLE JACK DANIEL'S. AND LISTEN, GET THESE KNIVES OFF THE TABLE. I'M DICK LANGLEY, MEDIA GURU. I HELP PEOPLE WHO MAKE BIG NEWS, MAKE BIG BUCKS. LENORA NEEDED AN AGENT, AND SHE'D HEARD ABOUT THE DEAL I NEGOTIATED FOR BOB BARKER. OH... PARK IT IN A GOOD SPOT. IT'S HER, THE ONE WHO CUT THE THING OFF. Dick: WHEN SHE WALKED IN, THERE WASN'T AN UNCROSSED LEG IN THE ROOM. EXCUSE ME, I AM LOOKING FOR DICK. OH, DICK! ( gulps ) WHOOPS. BUTTERFINGERS.

BUT IF I'M GONNA GET YOU THE REALLY BIG BUCKS, I'VE GOTTA KNOW THE REAL STORY. HMM? IN YOUR OWN WORDS. SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST START AT THE BEGINNING. WELL, I CAME TO AMERICA FOR TWO WEEKS VACATION. AND IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL, IT JUST BLOWED ME AWAY. THAT'S WHEN I MET JUAN WAYNE. WHO? JUAN WAYNE, MY HUSBAND. OH, JUAN WAYNE. YES. I REMEMBER THE NIGHT WE MET. YOU COULD ALMOST SMELL THE MAGIC. MUCHACHA, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR MUSTACHE? DID YOU SHAVE IT OFF? NO, I USED BLEACH CREAM. I BLEACHED MY CLEAVAGE, TOO. LOOK. YOU CAN DO THAT? IT MAKES THEM STAND OUT. THEY'RE MORE 3-D NOW. SEE?

TESTOSTERONE EXTRA. WHICH ONE? THE ONE IN THE HAT WITH THE BEER ANTLERS. All: ( chanting) GO, GO, GO! OH, LENORA, THAT'S A MARINE PRIVATE, A GRUNT. WITH YOUR CLEAVAGE, YOU COULD GET AN OFFICER. BUT HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE TOM CRUISE, MY DREAM LOVER. JUST WATCHING HIM MAKES ME DAMP. All: WHOA! LENORA, REMEMBER WHEN YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR SEXUAL... DEFORMITY? IT'S NO DEFORMITY. I JUST HAVEN'T HAD ORGASM... YET. BUT I THINK MAYBE THAT'S ALL GOING TO CHANGE. ( groans ) WHAT'S YOUR POISON? CAN I HAVE TWO BEERS? YEP. THERE YOU GO. HI THERE, HOT STUFF. I LIKE YOUR BEER HAT. OH, THANKS. MY NAME'S LENORA. WHAT'S YOURS? ( gulps ) UH... AH, FORGET IT. HE'S NOT INTERESTED. BUT HE HASN'T SEEN ME LAMBADA. ( gasps ) BUT YOU CAN'T! THAT'S THE FORBIDDEN DANCE! WATCH ME.

SHE WANTS YOU! HI THERE. OH, I'M SO HOT. LOOK AT THIS. Man: SHE LOVES YOU! Lenora: OVER HERE! OVER HERE! I'M A CAT. ( laughs ) THIS COULD BE YOU. WHOA! CAN'T SEE! CAN'T SEE! AH, WAIT... AAH! A-HA!

Lenora: OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER WAS SO, SO ROMANTIC. I WAS SHY, BUT HE WAS GENTLE. SO TENDER, REALLY. NOT LIKE THIS PORK CHOP. MM. SO ARE YOU, UH... YOU MET THE MAN OF YOUR DREAMS AND YOU GOT MARRIED. TELL US ABOUT THE WEDDING. YOU MEAN THE ONE DAY OF A WOMAN'S LIFE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL, MAGICAL DAY, WHEN SHE FEELS LIKE CINDERELLA ON A CLOUD SURROUNDED BY BABY ANGELS? IS THAT THE DAY YOU MEAN, DICK? SURE. OKAY. WELL, THE RECEPTION WAS OKAY, YOU KNOW, FOR DENNY'S, BUT THE HONEYMOON... ( speaking Spanish ) WHICH MEANS? IT SUCKED SO BAD. EVERY TIME WE MAKE THE WHOOPIE, HE HAVE ORGASM, AND HE DON'T CARE IF I DO. I WANTED SO BADLY TO CLIMAX, BUT JUAN WAYNE WOULDN'T EVEN TRY TO FIND MY MAGIC FUN BUTTON. NOT MANY OF US REALLY KNOW WHERE IT IS. WELL, YOU SHOULD LEARN. OH, YES, I'M GOING TO. ALL OF YOU. TOO ELECTRIC! OH! OUCH! MY HAIRS! AH! AH! OH, YES! YES! NO! NO! IT REMINDS ME OF MY MOTHER!

YOU'RE GONNA JIFFY POP! YOU'RE GONNA BLOW LIKE MOUNT ST. HELEN! WHO IS HELEN?! WHO IS HELEN?! TELL ME! WHO IS THIS WHORE HELEN?! YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS! SPEAK! SPEAK! OH, NO! ( crying ) EVEN IN OUR HONEYMOON BED, HE WOULD TORTURE ME WITH TALK OF OTHER WOMENS AND HOW THEY WOULD BLOW UP WITH THEIR ORGASMS. EVERYWHERE WE WENT, HE WOULD SQUEEZE THEIR BREASTS AND BOTTOMS WITH HIS EYES. AND THEY WOULD FONDLE HIS MANHOOD WITH THEIR EYEBROWS, LIKE THIS. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT TOOK THE JURY A WHOLE WEEK TO FIND YOU INSANE. IS THAT A JOKE? YEAH. YEAH, IT'S A JOKE. OH. Man: CAN I TAKE THAT? I WAS DIAGNOSED FOR MY TRIAL. I'LL TAKE THAT. AND THE PSYCHIATRIST SAID I HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOR. IN VENEZUELA AS A CHILD, I WAS KIDNAPPED VERY BRIEFLY BY A CIRCUS CLOWN. IT'S NOT FUN LIKE IT SOUNDS. WELL, IT MUST BE A VERY PAINFUL MEMORY. NOW GETTING BACK TO YOUR HUSBAND... I SUPPOSE IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT WOMEN NOTICED HIM. I MEAN, HE'S A GOOD-LOOKING MAN. YES, WHEN HE'S NOT DRUNK AND DROOLING, SO HANDSOME. A CHARMING DEVIL SENT BY... THE DEVIL... TO ROAST MY HEART IN A MICROWAVE. MY PASSION FOR HIM COST ME EVERYTHING! EVEN MY JOB! ( crying ) YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS? YOU'VE NEVER HAD AN ORGASM? NO, NEVER, NOTHING, NADA. IT'S LIKE I'M DEAD DOWN THERE. THE DOCTORS DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME. WHEN WE CAN'T HAVE AN ORGASM, IT'S ALWAYS THE MAN'S FAULT. DOESN'T YOUR HUSBAND KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING? WELL, HE TRIES. BUT MAYBE NOT HARD ENOUGH. I GUESS I'M LUCKY. I CAN JUST HOP ON MY WASHING MACHINE DURING THE SPIN CYCLE, HAVE TWO OR THREE ORGASMS. OW! SORRY. OH, HI, JUAN WAYNE. I'M ALMOST DONE, HONEY. Woman: I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT. DON'T FORGET TO CALL HIM, OKAY? THAT'S MY HUSBAND. OH. HE'S A DOLL. I WOULDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE CLIMAXING WITH HIM. UGH. OKAY, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO. NEXT TIME YOU'RE VACUUMING, USE THE DEEP-CREVICE ATTACHMENT. ( makes sucking noises ) OH, AND YOU GOTTA LEAN AGAINST A WALL OR SOMETHING. ( makes sucking noises ) OH, AND ACTUALLY IT HELPS IF YOU'RE WEARING PANTYHOSE. DON'T ASK ME WHY. ASK YOUR HUSBAND ABOUT THE COUNTING TECHNIQUE. IT GOES LIKE THIS, WATCH. ONE AND TWO AND THREE... Lenora: COOKIE WAS COMING ON TO HIM LIKE A TEN-CENT SLUT. AND HE WAS FLIRTING BACK, WASTING HIS SEXUAL ENERGIES ON HER AND SAVING NOTHING FOR OUR MARRIAGE BED. ( laughs ) ( screams ) YOU CUT ME! I SEE YOU MAKING PLANS FOR SEX, GOD DAMN IT! WHOA, WHOA. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. WHAT? OH, RIGHT! RIGHT! OW! YOU CRAZY BITCH! YOU WHORE-MONGERING BASTARD! OW! OOH! COME BACK HERE, COOKIE, YOU BLONDE PIECE OF SHIT! I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU... ( screams ) THERE YOU GO! RUN AWAY NOW WITH YOUR FAKE TITS! GOD DAMN YOU, BASTARD! WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?! YOU JUST MAKE ME SICK! JUST FOR TRYING TO SAVE MY MARRIAGE, I WAS FIRED! WITHOUT A JOB, I HAD TO STEAL JUST TO KEEP STYLISH CLOTHES IN THE CLOSET. MY DAYS WERE FILLED WITH SHOPLIFTING, AND MY NIGHTS WITH FRUSTRATING NON-ORGASMIC SEX. THE NIGHT THAT CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER STARTED OFF LIKE MANY OTHERS... ON MY MAYTAG. YES! YES! YES! NO. MAYBE IT HAS TO BE ON SPIN CYCLE. OH, THAT'S GOOD. OH, I LIKE THAT. OH, WAIT, WAIT. UH-HUH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH. OH, YES, GOOD. UH-HUH, UH-HUH. JUAN WAYNE, YOU'RE HOME. HI, HONEY. YOU KNOW, I THINK TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT. I FEEL HOT AND READY. I FOREPLAYED MYSELF. UGH. I DON'T THINK SO. I'M KINDA TIRED. I'M GONNA GO HIT THE SACK. BUT TONIGHT I'M GOING TO CLIMAX LIKE A RACEHORSE ON DRUGS. THIS TIME I'M GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE FINISH LINE, BABY. ( chuckles ) HERE, LET ME HELP YOU GET ALL NUDE AND NAKED. LENORA'S GOING TO SEX YOU UP. SHE'S GOING TO GUSH LIKE A CHICKEN ON THE TRAIN TRACKS. OH, LOOK OUT. LOOK OUT, HERE SHE COMES. LOVE ME. SHUT UP. OH, YOU WANT ME BAD. OH, I'M GONNA BE SICK. NO! NO!

I CAN'T DO IT! ( crying ) YES, YOU CAN! THINK OF CONNIE AND ALL THE ORGASMS SHE HAS STOLEN FROM YOU! BUT MAYBE CONNIE IS JUST AN OLD FRIEND OF THE FAMILY THAT HE RAN INTO. YOU'RE SO STUPID! THIS IS CONNIE! JOHN GAVE ME SEVEN ORGASMS TONIGHT... AND THAT WAS BEFORE WE GOT OUT OF YOUR CAR! NO! PUTA! FRIGID! SLUT! FREAK! WHORE! ORGASMICALLY CHALLENGED. ( gasps ) I KILL YOU FOR THAT!

MR. BABBITT, WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. THE POLICE ARE CONDUCTING AN EXHAUSTIVE MANHUNT FOR THE PHALLUS. I DON'T KNOW NO FANCY DOCTOR TALK. WHAT'S THAT MEAN? THE COPS ARE GOING BALLS OUT TO FIND YOUR DICK. WHAT IF THEY DON'T? THE BEST I CAN DO IS I CAN GRAFT YOUR BIG TOE ONTO YOUR STUMP. IT WON'T FUNCTION AS A PENIS, BUT YOU'LL LOOK NORMAL IN TIGHT SWIMWEAR. ( screams ) SHIPMENT! Lenora: OOH! THEY'RE SO CUTE, THE LITTLE CLOWN CANISTERS! I HAVE TO HAVE THEM! AND WHAT WILL YOU KEEP IN THEM? OH, SO MANY THINGS-- COOKIES, COTTON BALLS... MAYBE A PENIS. PEANUTS? I'M A NUT FOR PEANUTS! WELL, THESE AIR TIGHT CLOWNS WILL CERTAINLY KEEP YOUR NUTS FRESH. OOH!

AND IF IT WORKS, YOU SHOULD TELL THE JUDGE IT WAS MY IDEA, BECAUSE THEY GIVE TIME OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR, WHY NOT TIME OFF FOR GOOD IDEA? GET HER OUT OF HERE. BECAUSE IT WAS MY IDEA, AND IT WAS A GOOD IDEA, TOO! AND I HAVE SOME GOOD IDEAS ABOUT THAT HAIR PIECE YOU GOT THERE! THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. THE WORLD'S FIRST PENIS TRANSPLANT, AND THE DOC KEEPS A LID ON IT. I WONDER WHY. WHO KNOWS? THESE DOCTORS ARE SO SNEAKY WITH THEIR SECRETS. IT'S PENIS GATE. MADRE DE CHARO, THE TIME! I MUST GO. I HAVE TO GO TO THE TV STUDIO. THEY ARE PAYING JUAN WAYNE AND ME TO RE-ENACT THAT TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE NIGHT WHEN THINGS GOT, YOU KNOW, OUT OF HAND. HE AGREED TO DO THIS? WELL, HE NEEDS THE MONEY FOR THE DOCTORS. AND FOR ME, IT'S MY FIRST TIME SINCE MY TRIAL TO SEE HIM... AND TO ASK HIM TO COME HOME. ( chokes ) NO OFFENSE, BUT DON'T YOU THINK HE'D BE A LITTLE AFRAID TO GET BACK TOGETHER WITH YOU. JUST BECAUSE HE GAVE ME CONCUSSION AND I AMPUTATE HIS PENIS DOESN'T MEAN WE AREN'T IN LOVE. PEOPLE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND OUR SPECIAL KIND OF LOVE. WELL, I MUST GO. JESUS CHRIST! ( laughs ) MADE YOU JUMP! ( laughs ) OKAY. BYE-BYE, DICK RICHARD. SEE YOU IN THE FUNNY PAPERS. BOO!

I WASN'T WEARING THESE CHA-CHA EARRINGS WHEN I WACKED JUAN WAYNE, BUT THEY LOOK SO GOOD! WACK! ( chuckles ) ( burps ) TWO POINTS. WELL, IF IT ISN'T THE GINSU PRINCESS. OH, YOU'RE THAT BIKER SLUT, THE WIFE OF THE PENIS DONOR. I'M SO SORRY ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND. NO BIG LOSS. THE ONE THING I LIKED ABOUT DEKE WAS HIS PECKER. BUT NOW THAT'S ON YOUR HUSBAND. YES, I'M SURE JUAN WAYNE IS VERY GRATEFUL, EVEN THOUGH... HOW YOU SAY, THE PECKER MAY NEVER FUNCTION AS A SEX TOOL. OH, IT FUNCTIONS, ALL RIGHT. LAST NIGHT, WE DID THE NASTY FOR HOURS. YOU HAD SEX WITH MY HUSBAND? YEAH. WHEN THEY ASKED ME TO DONATE THE DICK, I SAID ON ONE CONDITION-- I GET VISITATION RIGHTS. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU! IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!
