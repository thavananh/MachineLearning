foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Thank you. But we're here now. It's just... I told her when our flight was. Okay, Lacy. I texted her three times. Like I said, maybe something came up. You would think that picking us up from the airport would rank pretty high on her list of somethings. Okay, okay. Look... take a deep breath. Everything is going to be okay. We're going to have fun. This is going to be fun, okay? Okay. I just... I just thought that things would be different now. I thought after I left, that they would actually miss me, because absence is supposed to make the heart grow fonder. I'm sure they missed you. I'm sure of it. Don't you know what they did the day after I left? They turned my room into a guest suite! They have been renting it out to travelers because my mother thinks it makes her more worldly or something. Last summer they rented it out to this professional dancer from Spain, and my mother loved it. He taught her the pasodoble. She was the envy of her bridge club. Pasodoble? This girl they have in here now... My mother's dream. Betsy loves to sew, Betsy loves to bake. She sounds fantastic. I can't wait to meet her. I just hate that I'm so replaceable. Hey... not to me, okay? All right. Let's get this over with. We're home. Mom, Dad. Not even here! Nice place. They should pay for dinner more. Where are all the embarrassing childhood photos? They're right over here. Oh my God! They took down my photos! Clearly they needed more room for their dancing girl and... They've erased me! It's like I don't even exist anymore. You're dating a ghost, Billy. Baby. Hey. I'm not going to survive this week. You're gonna get through it. I promise. No wonder she wasn't answering. She forgot her phone. What is that? Is that blood? No, I don't think that's... Mom? It's a weird sense of humor, but I like your parents. Ugh! Uh-hm. It's cherry. It's your favorite. They weren't forgetting about you, okay? They just wanted to surprise you. That's it. Okay. Forget everything I said back there. My parents are great. I can't wait for you to meet them. Yeah. Just remember to act surprised. Okay. Oh God. - Welcome home! - Oh God! Rebecca, it was so nice meeting you the other day. Thank you again for looking after our home while we're away. As discussed, I've left the key with our neighbor, Mrs. Higgins. She'll be expecting you. The Weather Service is calling for more snow later in the week. We've arranged for a friend of ours to plow the driveway. But you can also find shovels in the shed at the back. You'll find the fish food next to the bowl. Mail can be left on the kitchen counter. Help yourself to anything in the refrigerator or pantry. Oh, what else? Um... If you lose power, there's a generator in the garage. I should post instructions beside it. I'll make a note to do that. I think that's all. I've written down the names of some restaurants you might want to try while you're here. The ones with the stars are our favorites. You have my number if you need anything. Please don't hesitate to call. Thanks. Maybe after breakfast we can hike up the mountain. Did we ever measure the cherry armoire? There's somebody that wants to know how tall it is. Can you put that away, please? This is supposed to be family time. One second. Amy. Amy. Geez! Breakfast is ready. I'm not hungry. I made French toast. I can make yours with peanut butter and bananas if you like. Lauren liked peanut butter and bananas on her French toast. Yeah, she did. Let's go home. Lawrence residence. Oh, hi, Rebecca. It's Sara Lawrence. Oh, hey, Mrs. Lawrence. Are you calling to check in on the fish? No. I just wanted to warn you that we're coming home earlier than we'd planned. Oh. Is... Is everything okay? Yeah, everything is fine. We just had to cut our vacation short. Oh, that's too bad. So we'll be back later today. I hope that's okay. It's... It's fine. Thank you for calling to let me know. Drive safe. We will. ♪ It comes as some surprise ♪ We thought you were so brave ♪ ♪ No mountain was too high to climb ♪ ♪ The epitaph for your grave Hey. Welcome home! Thank you, Rebecca. - Hi. - Hey. Gotta pee. Oh, watch your feet... the snow. Hi. Did you have a nice trip? Yes, thanks. Good. Well, the house looks amazing. I see we left our home in good hands. Oh, well, we had some pretty long nights, me and the fish. Well, really, thank you. No, thank you for inviting me to stay. And you have a lovely home and a lovely family. Did your other daughter not go on the trip? I didn't mean to be nosey. I just noticed her pictures throughout the house. Is she away at college or is she... Uh... Uh. Our eldest, Lauren, she passed away last year. Oh, I'm sorry. That's okay. You didn't know. No. Really. It's not okay. I didn't mean to bring up painful memories. It's all right, honestly. Uh-hm. There's been a slight change of plans. Okay. And there's... there's no way that I can come early? No, I... I completely understand. Thank you. Oh! Hey. Is everything okay? Yeah. It's fine. My next housesitting gig can't accommodate me coming this early. Oh, no. We've put you out. No! No, no, no. I mean, it's your house. You have every right to come home early. I'm actually... I'm just going to try one of those pay by the week places. Oh, nonsense! It's our fault for not giving you enough notice. Why don't you stay here for a few days until you can figure something out? Uh, you know what, I wouldn't want to impose. I insist. It's the least we can do. Okay. It would actually be really nice to get to know your family. I mean, staying here, even for a short time, I really feel like I know you. Well, for the next few days, our house is your house. Okay. Thank you. I'll remember that. Amy? - Hmmm? - Hey, is this yours? Oh, yeah. Thank you. Uh-hm. Oooh! He's cute. What's his name? It's Travis. Hmmm. Boyfriend? Uh, I guess. I take it things aren't going too well. No. He's great, I'm just... You're just what? It's complicated. Hmmm. Love always is. Could I... give you some advice? You're young. Everything is going to be fine. You've just got to live a little. And speaking of... What do you guys do around here for fun? 'Cause two weeks and I'm starting to go a little stir-crazy. It's the perils of a small town. You have to go like 20 miles up the highway to hit anything relevant. Well, maybe we could go do something sometime. Your mom was nice enough to let me stay until my next housesitting gig. So it'd be really great to get to know you. Um, yeah. Okay. Cool. Wow, this is super-sexy. I bet Travis goes crazy for this. Okay. This is getting a little personal. I'm sorry. I was just kidding. I'm going to go see if I can help with dinner. Oh, and Amy... I can't wait to hang out. So I spend the next four hours trying to corral their cat back inside. I got an armful of scratches for the effort. I mean, I'm like... I'm like bleeding, and when I finally admit defeat, who do you think greets me at the door? Snowball! He was inside the whole time. I must have been chasing a stray. I have tons of stories like that. Did they all involve bloodshed? Uh-hm, fortunately for me, no. Bouncing around like that from place to place... Don't you ever miss home? Oh, I don't really have one of those. My parents both died a few years ago. So it's just me now. I'm sorry to hear that. You know, when they passed, I thought it would be a good time to travel. You know, see new places, meet new people. When Amy graduated, you talked about doing that, didn't you? Maybe you'll want to do it next year. Next year is college. Well, you know, housesitting actually helped me do both, so. Well, that doesn't mean you can't settle somewhere, plant your roots maybe? Yeah, eventually. Sure. I just, uh, I haven't found the right fit yet. Oh, actually, since we're all together, it's picture time. Come on! Come on, come on! It's going to be so much fun! Come on! Together! Why are we doing this? She just wants a picture, honey. Okay, ready? Say cheese. Cheese. It's for my scrapbook. I like a reminder of all the nice people I've met over the years. - Is it good? - It's really good. Yeah. It turned out really well. Hmmm. So is this like your job-job or what? Yeah. I housesit for dozens of families. What's the weirdest place you ever stayed? The weirdest? Yeah, you're all alone in someone's most private space surrounded by all their stuff. No, I don't snoop if that's what you're implying. Come on. You must have stumbled on something you weren't supposed to see, like a taxidermy collection or a sex dungeon. No, nothing like that. - Really? - Yeah. They have all been really lovely. Well, yeah, on the outside, but everybody has a dirty little secret, right? I'm sorry. I just... I got really lightheaded. Okay. Uh, I'll go get a broom. - Hey. - Hmmm? I'm sorry. That's okay. I should have discussed it with you first, but she had nowhere else to go. Yeah. Do we have any idea how long she's going to be here? We only talked about a few days. Hey. It's still early. Who's up for a board game? Because I'm undefeated in Monopoly, so... Maybe another time. Okay. I'll hold you to that. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Well, she's here for tonight anyway. It just seems like bad timing. Let's sleep on it. You coming up? Uh, in a bit. What are you doing in here? Oh, this is where I've been staying. Is that not right? No, it's not. The guest room is down the hall. I'm... I'm sorry. I'll... I'll collect my things. I'll make sure there are clean sheets. I got your stuff and here are some towels. Amy, I... I really am sorry. You didn't know. Sorry. You were having a nightmare. I tried to wake you. Looks like you're okay now. Good morning, my daughter. Hi. What are your plans for today? I don't know. Well, if you're looking for something to do, I'd love a hand in the garage. I want to paint that chest of drawers you found at the side of the road today. Yeah, maybe. ♪ I don't know what you're giving or how much ♪ Sarah. - Hi. - Hi. I hope I'm not intruding. No, not at all. You just look like you could use a warm-up. Oh, thanks. Did you do these? Oh, yeah. It's our business. We find old furniture at yard sales, estate sales, and Craigslist, and if it's in good shape, we restore it, but if it's too far gone, we paint it. Oh, they're beautiful. To be honest, the lost causes are always my favorite. I think everything has potential to be special. You just have to look hard enough. I wish I could do something like this. Well, I could actually use some help - if you're interested. - Mmm! No, you wouldn't want me. I might ruin it. Nonsense. They're already ruined. All we can do is make them better. Really? Sure. Run and get changed. I wouldn't want you to get paint on your pretty dress. Oh... I... I don't think that I brought anything that's appropriate. Would you... Would you mind if I borrowed something of yours? Sure. Have a look in my closet. On the left-hand side - are my work clothes. - Okay. - Hi, Dad. - Hey, sweetie. Re... Rebecca? Oh, hey, Mr. Lawrence. I was just being silly, you know. Dad. That's it. Long, even strokes in the same direction. You're a natural! Well, it helps when you have a very patient and talented teacher. I really am in awe of what you do. Well, once we're done here, we could head over to the consignment store and maybe pick out a piece of furniture you can finish on your own if you like. Really? That would be amazing! I've missed having a painting partner. Lauren used to love helping me. She had a real knack. What happened to her? I'm sorry. That's... That's none of my business. Never mind. She drowned. We were up at the lake house. We were supposed to leave that day. Amy challenged Lauren to a race in the middle of the lake. One moment she was running alongside her and the next she was gone. She hit a patch of weak ice. Amy tried to pull her out, but it was too late. Ever since... Amy's just... shut down. She won't talk to me. It's like when I lost one daughter, I lost them both. I'm sorry. I've shared too much. No. No, you don't have to apologize to me. Hey, you know, I'm sure she's going to come around. Hi. What are you doing? Reading. Wel-l-l-l. Your mom and I are headed over to the consignment store. Do you want to go? - No thanks. - Oh, come on! I'm picking out my first piece of furniture, and I could really use you there to help me decide. That's more Mom's forte. I wouldn't be much help. Oh, come! It would mean so much to her... And you can come for moral support because honestly, and no offense, but... your mom intimidates the hell out of me. So I need you there to help me decide or I'm just going to agree with everything she says. Okay. This is going to be so much fun! - Good morning, Mrs. Higgins. - Hi, Rebecca. I see you've met our new house guest. Well, the morning she arrived, she brought me over the most delicious raisin muffins. Oh, it... it was nothing. - I was just being neighborly. - They were yummy. Well, stay warm! - Okay. - See you later. See you. Okay. - What do you think? - Can I pull it off? Totally. It's very understated. You know, some of this stuff is really nice. Oh, that's St. Joseph, He's the Patron Saint of Families. Catholic school kid. - Oh. - Here, try it on. I... No, come on. It's totally you! - You think? - Uh-hm. Here we go. There. It's perfect. Come on. Give me your phone. I'll show you. Okay. Okay. And... say cheese. See? Totally you. Hmmm. Clair? I didn't know you knew the Lawrences. Excuse me? You're Clair from Miller Falls, right? Oh, no. You must have me confused with someone else. Oh, I'm so sorry. I must be losing my mind. You're just the spitting image... Rebecca, I think I found something. Come on, Amy. Do you know her? I thought so. She looks just like a young girl that used to rent a room from some people I knew, the Fosters. That girl had an angel on her shoulder. So tragic. - What happened? - Come on, Amy. You've got to see this piece. It's perfect. ♪ It was old and rusted and colored gray ♪ ♪ Strips of paint peeled away ♪ ♪ Nicks and dents from flying rocks ♪ ♪ Hatred hurled at every box ♪ ♪ But it didn't care, it had a coat of mail ♪ ♪ Steel monster was as big as a whale ♪ ♪ Ran headlong into every fight ♪ ♪ Wasn't afraid to die tonight ♪ - Hey, Dad. - Hey. Where's your loot? Nah, I was just there for moral support. Oh, well I'm sure your mom appreciated it. Not for Mom, for Rebecca. Well then, Rebecca. What do you think of her? Rebecca? Yeah. Do you think she's a good person? Yeah, I think she's harmless enough. Why? Mom's all ga-ga for her, but I have trouble trusting anyone who's that peppy. Amy Marie! What? Yoo-hoo! - Yoo-hoo! - Hi, Mrs. Higgins. - I'm coming. - Oh! Are you okay? That is enough for today! Well, let's get you inside. Next year... Ooooh... I am going somewhere warm. You always say that. Well, I might mean it if I could find someone to look after this place. Last year I went to visit my son and daughter-in-law in New York. I hired some young college-age kid to feed my cats twice a day. - It was a disaster. - Ugh! You're very lucky to have found Rebecca. Responsible people are a rarity these days. Yeah. Seems like you two really hit it off. Well, she's delightful. She wanted to hear all about you. - Me? - Well, your family. She was curious about what you were like, especially your sister. She couldn't get enough stories about her. And you didn't think it was strange that she was asking so many questions? No, it was normal. You know, she lost her own sister a couple of years ago. She felt very connected to your story. Sister. You know, I think she said her name was Clair. Let's, uh... Let's get you inside. All right. Why would she give us a fake name? Maybe it's a stage name like Lady Gaga. I'm changing mine when I get a record deal. Shut up! No, I swear she's hiding something. So some senile old lady mistakes her for someone else. It doesn't mean anything. Half the time we go to the nursing home, my grandma doesn't recognize me. No, but Mrs. Higgins said Rebecca told her she had a sister named Clair. So? So, the old lady at the store said that her name was Clair and that she had an angel on her shoulder. Like what does that even mean? Maybe she had a twin. I have an idea, let's take our shirts off and then we can talk about it. Shut up! Ame, it's been like six weeks. Wait. Here it is. Okay. Homeowners die in Miller Falls house fire. Thomas and Betty Foster are survived by son Scott. It doesn't say anything on here about a tenant. Maybe if I can find this guy, Scott, I can find out what actually happened. Yeah, you should try to find him... tomorrow... 'cause tonight you get to watch your super-cool boyfriend rock out. Fine, we'll go. Rock 'n' roll! Shut up! I need to get changed. All right. - Hi. - Hi. I'm so sorry. I just have to grab one thing. Sorry. Oh, thank you. Come in. I'm so sorry. I know you're closed. I just wanted to get Amy this pendant, and it was the only time I could sneak away without her noticing. Of course, dear. It's perfect. - That will be $40. - Okay. Actually, do you have a little box or something - that I could fit it in? - Yes, I'm pretty sure I have something. Great! Ow! God... You know, now that I'm looking at you in a better light, you do seem really familiar. What have you done? Oh good. It was so great to see you again. Jesus! Jackass! Sorry, no. That's it? Yeah. Those guys are jerks. Don't worry about them. What's going on, Ames? Nothing. I just... I have a lot on my mind. I know, and I'm not one of them, that's for sure. Travis, please don't be like that. I really need you right now. No, I think you're making it pretty clear that you don't need me right now. I just... Being back at the lake again and seeing where she died... That was over a year ago, Amy. How long are you going to keep milking that one? Okay. I think you need to take me home right now. Yeah. Hey, Amy. - How was your party? - What? I wish you had told me you were going. I could have used a night out. Hmmm. Oh good. You got my gift. Yeah. Thanks. You really didn't need to do that. Oh, no, I wanted to. You've been so welcoming to me. It was the least I could do. Hey, where does your mom keep her hair dryer? I'm in desperate need of a shower, but I don't want to go to bed with a wet head. Might catch my death. It should be in her bathroom in the bottom drawer. I looked there. I couldn't find it. Okay. I'll go find it for you. Thank you. You're a lifesaver. It was right on the top. I don't know how I missed that. Um, would you mind if I used your shower? It's warmer in there for some reason. - Um, okay. - Thank you. Parents' tenant, Claire... - Hi. - Hey. Is Amy home yet? Hmmm, yeah, she is, but... She's upstairs, but, um... What's wrong? Well, I... I'm sorry. I think she was drunk, and normally I wouldn't have said anything, but... What? Well, there's a bottle of sleeping pills by her bed, and I just really hope she isn't taking those with alcohol because that would be really dangerous. - Thanks. - Uh-hm. Amy? Mom. Oh, I was thinking... after you get your supplies, maybe we could have lunch. There's this great place I've been wanting to try and they have only Italian food, and I thought it would be really fun if... How are you feeling this morning? Hmmm, not good. I think I'm getting sick. Amy, just don't. Don't what? You came in completely drunk last night. No, I... I wasn't drinking. Please don't lie to me. Well, okay, maybe I had like half a beer, but that's it. I think I know what drunk looks like. Your speech was slurred. You're taking her word for this? You were passed out on your bed! I took your shoes off for you. That's not right. I know you're struggling... and maybe you're looking for some kind of relief - from what you're feeling... - It wasn't like that! Do you want me to go after her? No, no. You're fine. I'll talk to her later when she's had some time to think about it. When I think about the lies I told my mom, it makes Amy look like a paragon of virtue. Nah, she's a great kid. She's just scattered. I mean, who wouldn't be after the guilt she must feel. You really are a great mom. Am I? I don't always feel like I am. When I was younger, I started down a bad path, too, and I think my parents were really worried about me. What did they do? They sent me to a treatment center. Oh, wow, that's pretty extreme. Yeah. I mean, I know it sounds that way. At the time I was so mad at them. I mean, they were keeping me away from everybody that I loved, but a few days into it, I realized that they knew before I did. Knew what? That I was depressed... and I was... I was pulling away. I'd lost interest in everything that used to make me happy. I was turning to drinking and drugs and sex. I started to think that it would be better if I just disappeared. It was actually only in therapy that I realized that those are all ways of reaching out for help. I mean, I was drowning and I didn't even know it. And you forgave your parents? Yeah. If they hadn't made that extreme choice... I don't know that I would be alive today. I owe my parents my life. It's beautiful. It's not bad for our first collaboration. Okay. So what happens now? Now we take a picture and then Kyle posts it - and we try and find a buyer. - Oh, this is... It's so exciting! I'm going to go get your camera, okay? Okay. Hey. That chest of drawers turned out quite nice. We just need to take some pictures. Great. You know, working with Rebecca, I can't help but think about Lauren and how much we shared. I've missed that. But holding onto her memory so hard... It's not fair for Amy. I think it's hurting her. Maybe it's time we went through Lauren's room and decided what to keep. Really? I don't know how to do this. I don't have the answers. I don't either. We cannot keep that door shut forever. Do you remember when Lauren decorated her room for her 16th birthday? She was so proud. The whole thing by herself. Now what? We're just going to throw it all away? They're just things, Kyle. It's not her. I can't talk about this. Wow! Never stood a chance. Hardly a fair fight. Did you, um... see that chest of drawers Sara let me help with? Yeah. Did I totally ruin it? No, not at all. Are you okay? Me? Yeah. Fine. And I'm not imposing? No, no. You know, it's got to be hard living in a house with three women. I mean, everybody is constantly wanting to talk about their feelings. Yeah. You know, it may not seem like it, but, uh, I'm a really good listener... if you ever wanted to blow off any steam. Or you could just keep taking it out on the firewood. Could I try? - This? - Yeah. - You're kidding. - No! Okay. Good. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Be careful here. Here. Just got to be very careful. Okay. Put that hand right close to the blade... - Okay. - You get better leverage. - Okay. - You got it? - Yeah, I think so. - All right. Just... Whoa! I think somebody missed their calling. Well, it helps when you have a very talented and patient teacher. Thank you. You're a nice guy, Mr. Lawrence. Well, that's very kind of you, but you don't really know me. Maybe you remind me of my dad. You have his eyes. Wow, I was going to send out for pizza, but this looks much better. Now, I could tell everybody was a little down today. My mom used to always say anything can be fixed with good food and a lot of wine. So it looks like we got a buyer on the dresser already. - Wow, that was fast! - Yeah. Repeat client. - It's Huntington Inn. They... - Mr. Lawrence, here, try this. No, it's okay. No, no, no. Please. Just try it. Okay. Hmmm. That's good! - Yeah? - Could use some oregano maybe. Right. I knew I could count on you. Dad saves the day. So they were hoping for a delivery today, and I know it's a bit of a hike, but they were also asking if we could look into redoing six other rooms. - Could be good business. - Great. Okay, so I'm going to get the truck. Okay. I'll get changed. You don't mind, do you? No. No, no. Absolutely not. You guys go and hustle up some new pieces for us to work on together. Okay. We won't be long. Don't be late for dinner. Hello. Hey, it's Scott Foster. I've got time to meet today. Yes! Hi. Um... Uh... Yeah, I can meet you now. - You're in town? - Yeah. You know The Farmer's Daughter? It's on Main Street. I'm headed there now. Okay. Awesome! Thank you. I will... Um... I'll meet you there now. Okay... We need to talk... and I want you to be completely honest with me. Is her sauce better than mine? Not even close. Good! - Heading out? - Yeah. I'm making dinner. What time will you be back? Uh, don't worry about me. - Amy? - Yes, hi. Um, I thought you weren't going to show. I almost didn't. I had to make sure it wasn't her pretending to be you. - Clair? - Yeah. Tying up loose ends maybe. So what can you tell me about her? She rented a room from my parents after I left for college. They had a studio apartment attached to their house. Dad lost his job, they almost lost the house. She moves in, pays rent. It took the burden off. She helped around the house, chores. Mom claimed she was a godsend. Did you ever meet her? Once. It was weird. How so? Well, there's this girl, I never met her before, knew my parents about three months, and she's acting like we're having a damn family reunion. Insisted we all take a picture together. Do you have it? - What? - The picture. Why the hell would I have the picture? I just want to make sure we're talking about the same person. Do you have a picture of this girl we're talking about? Yes, I do. Um... Crap. I left my phone at home. I have it in some of my mom's old stuff. I can look. Why are you so sure that she did it? Didn't the police launch an investigation? By the time I got home, she was long gone. The whole thing just felt off. I mean, my mom called her the daughter she never had, but there I am planning the funeral, and she's nowhere to be seen. No forwarding address, no number. That girl... is not right. Look, that's all I can tell you. But, wait, wait! What do I do if it is her? Run. Is Amy here? Come on in. Ames? Amy. Is she in her... room? Uh-uh. Amy's not here right now. She just texted to come over. Hmmm, that's weird. Why are you wearing her clothes? Of course, the fact that she's not here means that her room is empty. I hear you're a drummer, that you're really good with your hands. Uh, I'm just going to go outside and text my girlfriend. Is Amy a good girlfriend? Yeah. She just seems a little... distant. You know, detached. She has a lot on her mind. I hope one of those things is you. Boys like you... they have needs. Amy thinks you're crazy. Maybe I am. Do you want to find out? We got that out of the way. Hey, Rebecca. Hey, Mr. Lawrence. Again? Oh, you didn't need to do that. No, really. You've been so nice to me. I just want to earn my keep. You're impossible. Really, it's fine. I like to help. - Let me help you. - Thank you. Oh, dinner smells so good. Thank you. I'm really excited about it. Um... Wow, uh... It's a condom wrapper. That was in her bed? Uh-hm. I need to have a discussion with my daughter. I'm sorry. Do you know where she is? No, I don't. She left a little while ago and didn't say where she was going. I'm going to call her. Oh! Oh! She must have left it when she went out. Oh! Um... - What is it? - It's probably not a big deal. I mean, she's young. Teenagers, they do this sort of thing. Let me see. Oh my God! You know what, let's just... Let's just hope she isn't sharing these with anybody. Yeah. Mom! Oh, good. You're home! - Mom, we need to talk. - Sit down! - What's going on? - Sit! You've been looking through my phone? And I'm glad I did. I found them, Amy. Found what? Okay, what... What am I looking at exactly? The pictures. No. Thi... This isn't me. - Amy, stop it! - No! It isn't. I don't know how they got on there, but... - It was her! She did this. - Amy? She's trying to turn you against me! She's not even who she says she is, and she knows that I'm on to her. - Isn't that right, Clair? - What? Eloise recognized her in the consignment store. She said that her name was Clair and that she stayed with friends of hers in Miller Falls. I looked them up. They died in a fire, but then you... You told Miss Higgins that you had a sister named Clair that died, so which is it... Rebecca? Clair? Yeah, I did have a little sister. We were basically twins. She rented the apartment and died in the fire. There was nothing in that news article about a third death. She's lying. You know, I've tried to be nice to you. I have tried to be your friend. I have treated you like family, and now you... No, I'm sorry. Mom, Mom... I need you to listen to me. I swear to you, she's lying. This is not about her. I'm concerned about you, you're my daughter. It's not just the sex. It's taking pictures, substance abuse. Substance abuse? What? Just go to your room! We'll talk about it when your father gets home. I should have guessed that you'd never listen to me. I'm the cause of all your problems, right? What are you talking about? We'd still be a family if it weren't for me. Admit it. You blame me for Lauren's death. - No! - Yes! I'm the one who wanted to go running on the lake. I'm the one who couldn't pull her back out when she fell through. - It was an accident! - She was perfect! She was the one with the bright future, and I was just the screw-up, right? You and I both know the wrong daughter died that day. How can you say that? Because it's true! Amy! Oh God! I thought it was Amy. - Well, what's going on? - We had a fight. She was really upset and angry. She said some terrible things. It's okay. I'm sure it's fine. She's been gone for hours. She won't answer her phone, and... I don't know what to do. Okay, I'll get your coat. Okay. I'll... I'll wait here... in case she decides to come home. I'll call you the second she does. Thank you, Rebecca. I know that she didn't mean to lash out at me... and certainly not at you. She... I'm sure when she calms down she'll realize that we just want what's best for her. I don't know how we'd do this without you. I know it's only been a couple of days, but this family really means a lot to me. You're a good mom, Sara. Here you go. Okay. Call us the second you hear anything. - I will. - Thanks. Oh, man. I had no idea she blamed herself. She thought we blamed her, too. I feel... I feel like it's all... How could I have missed this? Honey, you're doing your best. Okay? We all are. She's stopped doing the things she used to love. She's losing control. The drinking, having sex. She can't sleep without those pills. Wait, wait, wait a minute. What are you talking about? She's not herself. I mean, you've seen that. This last year she's been showing all the warning signs. Warning signs of what, honey? That she's not coping. Maybe we should get some professional help or send her somewhere. Uh, Sara, I don't... I just can't do this by myself. Look, Sara, you just need to calm down. - Right now. - I'm just worried, okay? I am worried that she's going to hurt herself, and I'm worried that... That if we don't do something that we could lose her, too. Let's just try to find her. Mom! Mom! Mom! What are you doing? Who are you? I don't understand what you mean. Who are all these people? Oh. Those are people who disappointed me. Is your name even Rebecca or... or is it Clair? Has everything you've said been a lie? No, no, not everything. So what, you just... You leach onto other people's families and you try to make it your own? You know, everybody wants to belong. You don't belong here. You think you can waltz in here and take my sister's place... You can't. Listen, I don't know what kind of scam you're running, but I'm going to tell everyone what a fraud you really are. No, I'm sorry. I can't let you do that. Stop me! You know, you're right. I can't replace your sister... but I think replacing you is going to be real easy. Ohh... You're up. That's no good. You know, I never understood the appeal of this game. Oh my God! Travis. I don't know why you're so upset. You know he cheated on you, right? So you're going to kill me, too? Hmmm, you know, I didn't want to. I never had a sister before. I was really looking forward to that. - You're crazy. - No. No, I'm home... and you don't belong here anymore. No! Mom! Mom! Please tell me she's here. No, no. She hasn't come home yet. It's nearly two in the morning. It's freezing out there. You know, why don't you come. I... I think I can salvage dinner. I think it's time we call the police. Keep an eye out, cover more ground that way. Shall I call Travis? Maybe she's reached out to him. Amy's gone. You know, maybe you should just let her go, because you heard the things she said earlier. Amy doesn't want to be part of this family. Ah, beans. Yes. Everything okay? Uh-hm. Yeah. Rebecca... Uh-hm. Do you know where Amy is? All I know is that Amy is spoiled and ungrateful, and people like that, they don't deserve a family. Why don't you tell us where she is? You know, I have done everything for you. I have been the perfect daughter. I have cooked for you. I have helped you... Rebecca, you're not our daughter. Yeah, but I can be! You know I can. You know that I can. You can tell him... You can tell him how good I am. I mean, don't you... I don't know what is going on here, but if you know where Amy is, you need to tell us. I told you that Amy's gone. I'm calling the police. No! No! Mommy, no, don't call the police! Hey, hey! Hey watch it! Kyle! Kyle! Oh my God! Great! Where did you get that? Hmmm, I got this in the top shelf in the closet where you keep it. How did you know that? Oh, I know a lot of things about you. Dinner's ready. Now, I'm disappointed. I really am. I thought that I had finally found a place that I fit in. You know, a loving family, a beautiful home, and I'm not giving that all up again. Hmmm. This really is an excellent year. You're going to love it. Sorry! So... I never heard how it went at the inn... Are we furnishing those six rooms? What do you want from us? You know, those designs were so beautiful, it actually inspired me to create a Pinterest page. I mean, it's nothing fancy, but... This is crazy... Do you want to see my Pinterest page? Kyle! He needs help! No, Kyle needs to eat his vegetables if he wants any dessert, huh? Please, please let us go! Where would you go? Hmmm? You're home. Salad? Hmmm! You haven't even touched your dinner. Hmmm? Oh, I see what's going on here. Whoa, you... You want to move straight to dessert. You know, that sweet tooth of yours is really going to get you into trouble if you're not careful. Be right back. Hmmm. Amy! Thank God you're okay. Did she hurt you? Not as bad as I'm going to hurt her. Dad? It's okay. You need to get out of here. Get help. No. I'm not leaving without you. Whipped cream or ice cream? - Go! - No, I can't leave you! Go! Quick! No? Okay. Uh-hm. 9-1-1 Emergency. Do you need police or ambulance? Both. Here we go. How perfect... does this look? Kyle. You get a really big piece. And Sara. Ice cream? No? Okay. You know, I always think it's okay to indulge every once in a while. You know what I mean? I... I... I agree. I think you're absolutely right. Mmmm. You know, I made this with apples from the store. I prefer the orchard, but they're out of season. That makes all the difference in the world, don't you agree? This fall, we'll all have to go there... - together. - Together. But there's somewhere else we should go. There's... There's a beautiful mountain - up by the lake house. - Sh-h-h-h! Do you like to ski? If you don't know how, I could teach you. That would be fun! There is one thing that will ruin a perfectly good dinner party... It's an uninvited guest. Stay right where you are! You are not welcome here. We're in the middle of dessert. Drop the knife and get back by that wall. Family vote... Who here thinks Amy should leave, hmmm? See? It's unanimous. I'm going to count to three. One... You are ruining everything. There is no place for you in this house, and you need to accept that! - Two... - What are you going to do? You're going to kill me like you did your sister? Amy, don't listen to her! - That's not true! - Isn't it? Did you even try to save her? Shut up! Or did you just watch her sink to the bottom? - Mom! - Amy! You should have stayed away! - You're insane! - No. No, I just want the things that I deserve. If you don't appreciate the things that you have, someone else will. Someone like me. Thank you. Maybe after breakfast, we could go for a hike up the mountain. The cherry blossoms are out. I'd love to take some pictures. Hmmm. Only if you're up for it. I think I can manage a hike. Breakfast. - Sheesh! - I made your favorite. Okay. Okay. We were talking about hiking the mountain today. What do you think? Is it a good day for it? I think it's a great day for it. - Thanks. - You're welcome. ♪ It was old and rusted and colored gray ♪ ♪ Strips of paint peeled away ♪ ♪ Nicks and dents from flying rocks ♪ ♪ Hatred hurled at every box ♪ ♪ But it didn't care, it had a coat of mail ♪ ♪ Steel monster was as big as a whale ♪ ♪ Ran headlong into every fight ♪ ♪ Wasn't afraid to die tonight ♪ And I still wanted to ride ♪ That long, hard train ♪ Cursing and blowing and breathing fire ♪ ♪ No mercy from that headless driver ♪ ♪ Racing time that never ends ♪ Another stop just around the bend ♪ ♪ Words like scars on a branded bull ♪ ♪ Drunken prophecies pissed on a wall ♪ ♪ Never hinting at what lay inside ♪ ♪ Grafitti splashed on its heaving sides ♪ ♪ And I still wanted to ride ♪ That long hard train
