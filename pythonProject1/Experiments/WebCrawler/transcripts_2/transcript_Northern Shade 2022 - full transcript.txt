Take care of yourself. Huh, boy? I thought that was just a rumor. Taliban injecting cigarettes with cyanide. Why buy 'em then? Real Trust. You want a light? How's Michelle and Luke doing? I gotta show you something. I just got it in the mail. That's my whole life right there, mate. You lucky son of a bitch. Hey, McLaughlin! Sniper! Man, get the fuck down! Sniper! - Another late night? - Oh, big-time, Marty. Your wife's in the cabin. I figured I'd let her sleep in. Yeah, good one. Don't you ever work? Yeah. Can't all be retired like you, bud. Marty. What am I supposed to say to that? Enjoy your freedom. Love you too. The number of new infections on the rise here in New Haven County... As officials try to find the source of cases... I hate being on this route. What's wrong with New Haven? All the fucking animals down here. You know what I'm saying? Don't do that. Okay, pal. Yeah, let me just get a six pack of Corona. Hey bud, I, I don't know you, but do you mind if I give you some advice? Don't get deployed or anything. She'll fuck your friends. What? ♪ And we were dancing beneath the starlight chandelier ♪ ♪ Chandelier ♪ Justin McLaughlin? My name is Frankie Rosa. I'm here to talk to you about your truck. My truck? Yeah, found it upstate yesterday. Abandoned. The Ranger. It's my brother's truck. Your brother? - Are you a detective? - PI. Charlie. I sold it to him about a year ago. I guess he hasn't gone to the DMV like I told him to a hundred times. Well, I found your brother's truck torched. And it's been linked to a couple of interstate drug busts, pills. You know anything about that? He went upstate a while back. I don't know anything about pills or why it was torched. When was the last time you saw him? When I sold him the truck before he went upstate. Well, make sure you at least go up to the impound and make sure you're not liable for holding charges. Let me know if you remember anything useful. Love the name, by the way. Thanks. You have reached the voicemail box of... Charlie. Is that you, bro? Fucking Ringling Brothers. - How's work? - Fine. I got me checking vacancies. Apparently that's essential. At least it's work. Have you heard from Charlie? It's been six months. You weren't the nicest older brother, Justin, before the Army. You were mean sometimes. Did you ever apologize to him? I was mean? Me? Why were you so mean? I was mean. You're not gonna go up there and look for him. That's fucked, Mac. He's your little bro. Seeing as how you left him to join the Army. I didn't leave him. You told me you did, remember? And Daddy walked out on me, left him with no money. My mom was an abusive drunk. Used to beat on him in public. Poured your fucking guts out on me, man. Shut the fuck up. - Want a light? - Fuck you! You've been home seven fucking years, Mac. You know we gotta go up there, right? It's not far from my place. You have reached the voice mailbox of... Charlie. Charlie, it's Justin. Call me back. Fuck. Looks like shit I'd see in Afghanistan. Army? Me too. A local woman hired me to find her son, Nicholas. I found your brother's truck while investigating her case. I can take you up there. - Wow. - It's beautiful, huh? There's an old abandoned sawmill about five miles up the road. I heard gunshots from back there. I haven't gone past the main gate though. We should check the lake house. - Lake house? - Our aunt's place. She lives in Vermont now, so she's never around. Charlie was staying there. Charlie? Oh! Here you go. Have you seen my son Nicholas? No, no, sorry. I'm not from here. Keep one? Stop! This is a restricted area. Turn around. I'm looking for my brother Charlie. I don't want trouble. There ain't no Charlie here. Turn around. I said, there ain't no fucking Charlie here! Turn the fuck around! This is private property. Turn around. You should go visit. Wouldn't that be weird? You promised you'd stay in touch and you didn't. That's weird. Twice in seven years ain't gonna kill you, man. Justin, I'm so glad you called. It's good to see you, Michelle. Come on in. I'm just getting Luke ready for bed. Make yourself at home. There's beer in the fridge. ♪ Better angels ♪ ♪ May seem invincible ♪ He goes right out now. It's great. It would be nice for you to see him sometime though. He wore the shirt you got him until it fell apart. I'm glad he liked it. Uh, do you mind? I haven't been around many people. Yeah, go ahead. Me neither. You wanna sit? It's so nice to have somebody else in the house. I've only seen my friend Tiff since COVID hit. You doing all right? Yeah. It's just stressful being a teacher right now. The older teachers are so overwhelmed. I have my own lessons to do and I can't be IT support. How about you? Still living on your boat? Yeah. How's your brother doing? Charlie, right? Yeah. He's good. You seemed to miss him when you were overseas. What do you mean? There was one time I was on the phone with Noel and you hopped on the line for a few minutes. You said you missed him a lot. You don't remember that? No, no, but, um- - You could have been drunk. - Yeah. I mean, Noel and I would get pretty shit-faced together. He's missing. - Who? - Charlie. Wait. That's why you're up here. They found this truck near the old sawmill. You know it? I dated a guy who used to hang out up there. The people he was with turned out to be dangerous, so he left. I can ask him to talk to you. I'd appreciate that. Don't move! Get on the ground. Jesus Christ. You scared the shit outta me. I'm Austin. Michelle wanted us to talk. I'm not a threat, dude. Thanks. So you know Charlie? I do. Good dude. Was a good dude. What does that mean? Means I was friends with him. He came around the same time I did, but, but he didn't wanna leave when I did. See, I'm not into selling pills or hawking my fucking scripts. That's not why I joined a militia. But your brother didn't take issue with it. It's a means to an end. I made plans to leave. I told the cops what I knew, but the lazy fucks didn't even go up there. What are they preparing for? What's anyone preparing for? - How many are there? - A dozen. There's this one sick fucker Matthew. Other guys he found online, and your brother. Listen, I'm not certain that your brother ratted me out, but somehow Billy got wind. - Billy? - Leader, ex-military. Not sure what branch. Last name? Huh. No, you don't wanna do that. No. No, they keep it guarded. Cameras, wire traps in the fucking woods. - I can handle myself. - Maybe, but someone with them has feelers, man. Antennas. They're already after that PI. - Frankie? - Yeah. Jesus, be fucking careful. They burned my eye out and they liked me. You don't, you don't know the pain. So, uh, yeah. Yeah, I liked your brother, but he wasn't there when they pouring bleach into my fucking eye! So, I don't mind if karma's the bitch people say she is. I said, there ain't no fucking Charlie here! This is private property! I know he's here. Turn the fuck around! Hey, Todd. What's up? All right. Follow me! Step out. Arms. Arms. Hey. Shit! You don't need it. We're just talking. Whoa, boys. No need to get testy. Welcome. I'm Billy. It's all right. We're back to shaking hands. I don't have the virus. - Justin. - Good. Well, now that we're not strangers, let's go on in. Let's have a chat. Sit with some tea. It's about the only thing the Chinks make good, anyway. I realize our security detail put you on edge, and I do apologize for that. We just don't allow visitors to carry guns. We can talk out here. Tell me where my brother is. Charlie McLaughlin. Mm. Fine, follow me. All of this, the mill. This land has history. Native Americans lived here. The timber cut was used for the first settlements in New England. This is sacred land. The quarry you passed, the stone that the Statue of Liberty stands on was carved from out there. Then the state comes in and builds a fucking highway right through the middle of all of it. Imagine, I could be growing a million dollar marijuana farm if I wasn't living in fucking Connecticut. - Whoa, wait. - Clear, dark. Dark. All clear. Dark. - Clear. - Dark. Charlie talked too much at first. - Clear. - You know what that's like. - Clear. - You know what that's like. - All clear? - Clear. - All clear? - Clear. Having to listen to somebody complain about the stupidest shit after seeing the worst that humanity has to offer. After cleaning your best friend's guts out of a Humvee, the last thing you wanna hear is some bitch complaining about the milk in her vanilla latte. I've consumed moments that make living as a civilian nearly impossible. Now remember, as soon as you hit that fucking door... This is my wave, living inside of it. So first person, you better fucking hit. - Yeah. - Bring it in, over here. We can't all isolate ourselves on a boat adrift without intention or purpose. Let's try it one more time. All right? Here we have rules and codes. - Dark. - We try to maintain order. - Dark. - Even though the fat cats in Washington fail us, we have something of value to offer society. - Clear. - Dark. There's something in the air, Justin, and it ain't just the fucking virus. Try to buy ammo. People are stockpiling it like toilet paper. This country's going to hell, headed towards Marshall Law. Not an our watch. You gotta hit them pretty fucking fast before you get to the tunnels. So what do you say? A vet like you could be one hell of an asset. Not just a body, family. Where the fuck is my brother? Take him. - Are you sure - Did I fucking stutter? Hey Billy, we got the rooms pretty well mapped out. Can't you see that I'm fucking busy? Yeah. Okay. You come here again, I can't make promises. We shoot trespassers. Hey, let's go. What the fuck is this? There's no one out here. The fuck? Take him with you. What? No. Charlie. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! No! No, no! Charlie! No! No! Charlie! It can't, it can't... I didn't do this! No! It wasn't me! I can't fucking do it! You sure that's your brother, Mac? It's not Charlie. You should bring him back. It's a crime scene. Cops are not gonna come up here. That's what Austin said. Remember? If the body was on the property, it would be a whole different story. They showed me exactly where the body was buried. How is that not proof they killed that kid? Do you have any evidence of a crime? Are there any witnesses? I, I can't just go and investigate every person who walks around in camo in the woods. Do you have any names other than Billy? I can get you your fucking names! Every single one of those gear queers, all right? It's not enough to get a warrant to search that property. How many kids have to turn up in shallow graves, Chief? You know I don't have enough to get a warrant for the property. Frankie, come on. You know this. My brother's missing. If you're not gonna do your job, I will. I would strongly advise... The way I see it, you solved a missing person's case today. The way I see it, we need to solve a murder. I'll wait for the coroner's report. You know, Frankie, you could have been something really special at this department. I saw you climbing up the ranks. Hey. So he's definitely up there? Yeah, they kept him hidden from me! Hey, easy. Whoa. I'm fine. Chill, Mac. I talk to him sometimes. Who? Noel. That's good though. It's healthy. You should stay here tonight. I'm fine to drive. Please. It's safer. You don't know if those guys will show up at your lake house. Sorry about the tail light, officer. It went out yesterday and I got, I gotta get it fixed. You've been running your mouth to anyone, Austin? - What? - Billy wants to talk. Justin. Sorry. Um, you can sleep in the bed with me, if you want. Just for company. Oh God. One dollar. Do you have a dollar? Uh, sorry, no. One dollar. One dollar. You little fuck. Piece of shit. You set us up. Fucking killed him. You killed him! Chill, Mac. The boy had nothing to do with it, man. Mind your fucking business! Justin. Justin. Justin, wake up. Fuck. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm okay. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I just get these... I'm fine. I guess this is one thing I've been spared from what other wives say. Just next time, just shake my foot and repeat my last name and I'll wake up. Okay. Next time? I think you should sleep in the living room. I don't want Luke to get confused. Yeah. Okay. Fuck. Fuck. Yeah, a family thing came up, uh, I won't be in today. Yeah, fine. Thanks. Charlie. What's going on? You all right? You gonna say something? I need you to leave. What? You're messing things up. And I have something important to do. I can't have you here asking questions, getting in the way. What are you talking about? I was looking for you. Just leave. Is this you talking or that fucking weirdo Billy? I have people in my life that actually give a shit about me now. You don't think I give a shit about you? Did you ever? Charlie... Listen, I understand you don't wanna talk to me, but Mom's worried about you too. She's been trying, she's putting in the work and you haven't been there for her. I haven't been there for her? That's a good one. You haven't been there for her, asshole! - I joined the Army! - Oh yeah, I forgot. Tell me, did you do that for us or did you do that for yourself? Go back to your fucking boat. Joining a gang in the middle of the fucking woods like some replacement family is not gonna fix anything. That's funny. That's exactly what I thought when you joined the Army. I joined the Army because it was the best option I had. That we had. Or you could have gotten a fucking job. Taking care of your younger brother. Checked your mom into a fucking rehab! Did you ever think about that? Of course not. No, it just all fell on me. But then you come back home and woo-hoo! I said my peace. What makes you think you can start giving a fuck now? It's all good to have a unit with a mission when you're across seas, right? Part of some state-sponsored trip. What about back here at home? That's when I'm not allowed to have a brother in arms? Fucking hypocritical society, just like you and just like Mom, hypocrite. What are you talking about? Look at yourself! Fuck you! You left me with a junkie! - What are you on, bro? - I'm not on anything. I'm the only one in this fucking family that's not! You still drinking like a fish? Huh, Justin? For once in my life, I feel like I have a purpose! Can you say that? Huh? After you've been home for seven fucking years, Justin, you're finally settling in. Do you feel like you're part of something? Bro? I'm not gonna let you fuck this up for me. Don't follow me. Stop looking for me. Just fuck off! Fuck! All right boys. Charlie, stand right here. - Here? - A little bit too far. You wanna get down like this. Right. Keep it right to that entrance. Now listen up, once we breach the north entrance, we have to take that fucking hallway. Go on now. Charlie, you need to be prepared to canvas the area. Charlie, are you with me? Yeah. Okay. I'm Captain Tim Smith with the Davis Town Police Department. We treat every overdose as a scene of a crime. Every OD we prevent is a lead on a dealer. We find the dealers, we save the community. We don't have the resources to be battling two pandemics, so we need you, the parents, to be our eyes and ears. Any leads with that truck you're looking into? - What? - Don't worry. Our little secret. For the record, I respect that you left an apartment. We need more cops like you. Vets who've, you know, vets who've seen some shit. Appreciate it. It's bullshit like that. You know? It makes people hate cops. Hey, lock that for me. Will ya? Justin. Get to bed. You're a mess. Hypocrite. I just wanna help. Can I get on the boat? Rule's a rule, Nance. It's dad's rule. Your father will never come back for this boat. A rule's a rule. - Up here late, isn't it, bud? - Yeah. Send up a flare if you need any help. I got your fucking flare right here! Going topside. Whoa, I like laughter! Mm! Trust the fall. Trust the fall. Taliban killed him. It's his brother. Freeman, call security. Let's go, Mac. Uh. Come on, Mac. Get your shit together. Are we still friends? Of course, man. All you did was fuck my wife. Mac dog, I'm fucking with you, man. She needed someone, someone she could trust. I was supposed to bring you back to her and to Luke. My little man's growing up way too quick, Mac. You got shot because you were showing me their photo! I got shot. That's what happens. No, Mac. No time for that. After you were gone, I felt useless. I couldn't wait to come back home, but now... You still feel useless. I get it. Where did it go? Mac, dog. Listen, there's something off about what your brother said. He's got a mission? What the fuck does that mean? I've got nothing. You honestly can't find purpose? You got a brother who needs you for one. - He hates me. - And you've got a fucking hole in your head, two. You got a dick that kind of works. Two and a half. I can't help him. He doesn't, he doesn't want my help. No one fucking asked if he wanted your help. It's your duty. You need to prove to him that you'll be there no matter what. You need to do an extraction. Bring him home. Don't take no for an answer. I'd go in there with you. You know that, man. I got guns at home. You remember what I said? If there was ever an emergency, Michelle knows the code. Justin. Justin. Slight change of plans. Charlie, you're driving. You'll take Matthew tomorrow. You're not coming with us. Someone's gotta mind the fort, big dog. I'll wait here for Tim and we'll catch up with you later. - This wasn't the plan. - Sometimes, Matthew, plans change and that's all right. Hey. We put a lot of time and energy into this. Don't ruin it for us. Austin and Nicholas, they were chickenshit. Okay? They deserted us. They had no vision. But you and Charlie, you're different. You got hearts. Now is not the time for self-doubt. Right? You understand? Good man. Load up. You handle that business with your brother? Yes, sir. He's gone. That a boy. Hey, he left you, okay? Hmm? He left you. Don't you ever forget that. I will never abandon you, Charlie, ever. Justin. That asshole. - Hey, Kenny. - Had a rough night. Rise and shine. Can see why you prefer it out here. Thanks. Didn't take you for a craft guy. It's warm. My brother told me he's preparing for some kind of mission with that group. Told me not to stop him. That's why I left. You remember when American militias were just vets and farmers who wanted to protect people from government overreach? They're not whatever the hell kind of group your brother's got himself into. Did you ever think about joining one? No. I mean, Noel and I talked about what it would be like to get together in case some shit went down, but that was if there was a zombie apocalypse or something. Man. Noel? Friend I had in the Army. Most of these people aren't anything close to a militia. Just fucking con artists and posers. Do you ever think about contract work, private security? Nah, I saw those guys overseas. As glorifying as it looked, it wasn't for me. If anything, Noel and I talked about going to Syria. Help the Peshmerga fight Isis. You know, that was then. What about you? What made you want to become a PI? I was a police sergeant after the Army, but I left the department. Why? I responded to a suicide call, a man on a bridge. When I got there, he was just staring over the edge and then he turns and I can see he's got this silver revolver in his left hand, and I drew on him and said, "Drop your gun." "Can't do that," he says. "Just shoot me. I'm a vet." And he spreads his arms out. And I was just... I said, "I'm not gonna shoot you just drop the gun." I could just see in his eyes. I told him I wasn't gonna do his dirty work for him. And I think that surprised him. He, um, just broke down. He cried and, uh, then I drove him home. But that is not department policy. I'm supposed to shoot him. He's armed and he's a hostile threat. They were actually supposed to fire me. I could tell Chief was really torn up about it, so I left. Stricter terms of engagement in Afghanistan. - Win their hearts and minds. - Yeah. Imagine if it were like that here. I never would've forgiven myself if I shot him. If I gave up on him. I know I did the right thing. Yeah. It's what matters. Would you be willing to go there with me to get him out? Yeah. Shut up! Our little traitor. There are certain people who will never learn their lesson no matter how many eyes you burn out of their fucking head. Doesn't mean you can't have a little bit of fun though, right? No, no. No, no, no, no. 130,000 vehicles per day, not a single one can hear you screaming. Go on, Charlie. Finish him off. Don't you think he's learned his lesson already? Of course not. Besides, I need to make sure you can do what's necessary when the time comes. Now go ahead, son. Put one right there. We have a mission to accomplish and this traitor compromised it. As simple as that. Just pull the trigger. I can't. Oh, for fuck's sake, I know I can rely on you. No. Necessary evil. He was only gonna complicate things. As for your brother, he'll keep his mouth shut about us, right? Because if he can't... Uh, yes, yes, sir. Good man. Big day tomorrow, Charlie. All right, bye guys. Hey. Noel all said if I was ever in trouble that I could get some things from the garage. How many guys are up there? Seven that I saw. Doesn't mean there aren't others. I don't know anyone else that I can trust with this. Thank you. We're ready. Trip wire. Good eyes. This is it. There's no cover to the trailer. We need to move fast. Stay low, follow me. - Copy. - Ready? - Mm-hmm. - Move. Camera. Let's hope they're not watching. I saw Billy come out of that shack. It's at least a hundred meters. Ready? Yeah. Clear. Whoa. No way he earned all these. Let's keep searching the property. Don't move. You're too late. It's already in motion. Guard the steps! You brought back up? Shut the fuck up. Damn. I bet it's that fucking PI. Sit! Were you relieved when you found out that it wasn't your brother? Sorry for the emotional rollercoaster, but his mom started reminding me of this sand nigger back in Iraq who wouldn't stop looking for his son even though half the village watched him blow himself to hell. It was nice of you to give her some closure though. Hmm. You did the right thing. I knew you would. Fucking liar! You were never in Iraq. You never served. Fuck you, I never served my country! You got a Navy cross for being in the Army. That was my father's, military family, but I don't have to answer you. Fucking stolen valor piece of shit! Stolen, stolen valor. You got that wrong. I just got a bunch of useless fucking metals and uniforms. Where's my brother? On a mission. Where's my fucking brother? Nice. There it is, the fire. - Justin, you good up there? - Fine! Yeah, bud. You good? Don't make me ask again. You gonna kill me? Look at me! Why is my brother doing your bidding? You think I have something on him? No. I saw his potential. Same with Matthew. That boy was a ticking bomb and I took that energy and I harnessed it. I focused him, made him see straight. Your brother, he just wanted a purpose. Like you, Justin. Billy's gonna be so pissed we're going back, man. You don't think I don't know that? No shit! Then why the fuck are we going back? Billy should be here. We, we planned this together. We should go down there together. Why doesn't anyone stick to the fucking plan? Oh shit. Justin, we need to go! I know where they are! Coming! I told you, it's too late. You'd only get hurt. Hands! Your brother told me you used to beat up on him. - Shut up. - Hey man, it's all good. Not your fault. I understand your old man used to beat on you before he left. You know when elephants fight, it's the grass that suffers. Somebody's gotta protect the grass. Right? So you're the shepherd? Mm, the shepherd. I like that. Hmm. Never thought of it that way. - I bet. - You had to compensate for an absent father, hmm. That's the problem with the new generations, soft as shit. No fucking balls. Fathers teaching their sons how to be pussies. Masculinity, out the window. Uh! I'll deal with you when I come back. The order of the covenant is thicker than one of the wombs, you understand? Your brother made a covenant! They're planning an attack on the state capitol. I've told the chief. What? They've got blueprints. Come on. What took you so long anyway? Who is that? Weren't you supposed to get rid of your fucking brother? Move! - Stop the truck! - Fuck, Mac! Are you trying to fucking trick me? - Did you hit them? - Fucking A, I hit 'em. I'm taking fire on Mill Road. Tell the chief. My brother's on the driver's side. Take position! Take position, goddammit! I'll cover you, sweep around the logs and hit 'em on their flank. Charlie won't fire at you. You sure? Yes. Ready? Move! Motherfucker! Fire back, man! Light 'em up! Motherfucker! Uh! Reloading! Fuck! What the fuck are you looking at? - Move! - Fuck. Take her out. - Fucking move, kid. - Take her out! Charlie! Fuck! Move! Move! Matt? Matt? Oh, fuck. Are you good? Don't run. Don't run. You didn't do anything wrong. Charlie, wait! Take this. - But. - Charlie! Charlie! Charlie, wait! Charlie! Fuck, ah, fuck, shit! Charlie! Fuck! Don't keep running, please! I fucked up! I need, I need my brother back! I know I was mean to you. It was, it was never because you deserved it. No matter what I said or did. There was a lot going on. Mom was a fucking mess. But I treated you like shit. Me! I, I took it all out at you. And then I fucking left. I left you. You were right, Charlie. I'm the one who fucked up. I'm sorry! Listen, I understand that you wanna be a part of something, so just believe in something, there's nothing to protect, but that, that fucking charlatan almost had you do something that you could never take back. I wasn't gonna go through with it. I was just gonna drop them off and then bail. Okay. That's good, that's good. I'm proud of you, Charlie. I'll be a better brother. I fucking promise. I love you. Okay? Justin, you out here? Shit! Charlie, no! Wait. We can tell them you were forced into it. Justin. - I lost him. - Which direction? He's heading south on the tracks. Frankie tells me your brother was a hostage? Come on. Let's go check on Frankie. It's okay, Charlie. Things, things just got fucked. I forgive you. Still have a mission to accomplish. Let's get in the truck and let's go. Okay? Charlie, I said I'd never abandoned you. Come on, let's go. Yo. Goodbye, Charlie. I'm not gonna say anything. I know, Charlie. You hear that? 457, that your gunfire? Negative. Hopefully it's just someone shooting at coyotes. Be right back. This is Chief Till. I need you to patch me through to the captain of the police department and Chief Rodriguez right now. Billy's in the wind. Sorry about your brother. We'll find him. Thank you for inviting me out, Justin. Sure, Mom. Do you wanna wait and see if he shows? Nah, it's okay. We're losing light. You're never only haunted by one ghost, Mac.
