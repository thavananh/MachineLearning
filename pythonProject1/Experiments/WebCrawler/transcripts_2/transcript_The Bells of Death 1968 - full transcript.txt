You've been following me for a day and a night, ...with no sleep, no food or drinks. All this because you want to learn martial arts? Why do you want to learn? To avenge for my family. Xiangxiang. If you keep running like your father did, ...we'll cut of your legs. Come back... Xiangxiang, Xiangxiang. Your father has sold you off; What's the point in running? All the girls in our town... want to be in Taotao Mansion. Come back... Come back... or we'll break your legs. Xiangxiang... Don't run, stand still. Please let me go. They want to break my legs. Young man, are you sure you want to be a part of this? Don't worry, stand on the side. She's a hooker at our Taotao Mansion. You don't want to live? C'mon, hand her over to me. Who are you? Young man. What? Young man. She's a courtyard prostitute at our Taotao Mansion. She is trying to run away. I've been ordered to take her back. She's a hooker, then why can't you hand her over to me? Certainly, if you can afford it. We can sell her to you. Here's the money I'm paying you for her. Take it. And consider the money on the ground as a tip. If your boss thinks it's not enough, tell him to find me. Please come inside... Waiter. Tidy up a room upstairs. Please... What do you want? Let go of me. Let me go. Who are you? Are you just like them? Just as bad? They said your dad sold you off, is that so? My dad wouldn't do that. He has only one leg? How do you know? Have you seen him? No, I haven't. I've only seen his leg. My poor father... they killed him! What can I do now? I hate you to death, Tao Gongquan. So he's doing it intentionally, he's looking for trouble himself. Master. I've already sent someone to spy on him. He won't slip away. Brother Yang, have you heard of... this person during your trip here? No. I guess he's just a fresh swordsman. Brother Tao, if you want, ...I can catch him for you. Thank you. But this young man uses leaves as his weapon. There's a saying: Even a mighty dragon is no match for native serpent. Say, although he may be really skilled, ...l'm not scared of him. Get up, bring some men; Go catch him. Yes. Yes. Brother Yang, I haven't been a good host. Come. Here. Get some young women in here! Yes. You're too kind, Brother Tao. You should... enjoy your stay here. My father has been missing for two days. I was caught by Tao's men yesterday, they said that my father sold me off. I didn't know that they've killed my father. I escaped earlier when I had the chance, ...hoping to look for my father. Didn't at all expect you to save me. I thought you're like them... just as bad! Now I understand. I can imagine how my sister felt... when they kidnapped her. Have you seen anyone... who uses a qiankun bow? No, I haven't. The other is very pale, shoulderlength hair; Uses a sword, sort of. Have you seen him? No. There's one who's dark, ...and bald. He carries a big axe, nine feet long... Have you seen him? No. What about in Taotao Mansion? I was locked up in a dark room, I didn't see anyone. Why do you want to look for them? My mission is to find them. Let's go. There's only one place. Where to? Taotao Mansion. I won't go. Have you heard of the saying, reborn after death? Let's go. Don't be afraid, stand back. Oh no! Oh no! There's an intruder! Master... What's the commotion about? The young man has brought Xiangxiang. Where's Baohu and the others? None of them is back. Don't. The boss is the one with the beard. You're Tao Gongquan? And you are? What can I do for you? I want to find a few men. Who might they be? Tao Gongquan, you've been in business for a long time. Do you know someone... who uses a qiankun bow? Master, does he mean Uncle Zuo? Young man. You're referring to Zuo Jinglong, qiankun bow. But I hear that he's been using a sword lately. Have you seen him? Not recently. And there's one... who's pale, shoulderlength hair. Master, that's the second uncle. Have you seen him? No. There's a bald one, he carries an axe, nine feet long. They are all martial arts experts, what's the grudge you hold against them? Let me try to settle it. They killed my parents, does that count? Do you think you can settle this? The bracelet looks familiar. The third one is Yang Zhang, Xiuluo axe. He was here. And now... Mr. Tao. Do you know where he is? Brother Wei. Master... Come with me, Xiangxiang. Come out, everyone! Or I'll burn this place down. No... I'll get them. Come out! Hurry! Faster! Come out! Or I'll burn this place down. Come out. Come out. Take care of this girl. Don't you dare bully her! Or I will come back and hunt you down, ...and I'll use my sword to kill you. Where are you going, Brother Wei? Wait here for me. Don't worry, they wouldn't dare to hurt you. Master. Why didn't we fight with that kid? We don't know his background, it's better to avoid it for now. After we've found out more, ...then we can kill him. That bracelet hanging on his chest, ...looks familiar. Right, in Beihe village. On that woman's wrist. Master. Yang Zhang, Xiuluo axe. A Beihe villager wants you to pay for your blooddebt. Go! Into the woods. I'm here to avenge for... something that happened in Beihe village 5 years ago. Yang Zhang, you can't run. This is a debt of blood, a life for a life. Yuanke, come here. Master. Go to Xiuzhou & report to your second uncle, now! Hurry. Yes, master. Yang Zhang. Do you remember the young wood cutter? Yang Zhang. You killed my father. It's my second brother who killed your father. It wasn't me. Every debt has its debtor. Where's he now? In Xiuzhou. My mother was killed by Zuo Jinglong, ...qiankun bow? Where is he? I don't know. Really? I don't know. What about my older sister? Zuo Jinglong kidnapped her. It's got nothing to do with me. Is that so? And my younger brother? Are you responsible? Yang Zhang, who killed my brother? Brother Wei. Brother Wei. Brother. Boss Ye. You've killed him. The money? What a good job, You got rid of him so easily. A small token of appreciation. Boss Ye, goodbye. Second Uncle, my master was killed by someone. The surviving victim of a family... who got killed five years ago in Beihe village. He's very skilled. That's him, that's the sound of the bells! That's him. That's him. He's here to look for you. He followed you here? No, it wasn't me. I didn't lead him here. I didn't. Second Uncle. Second Uncle. I didn't. Second Uncle... Don't go. I'm here. Please come in. You're looking for me? Please come in. Come inside. Xiangxiang. How did you find me? The sound of the bells brought me here. My dad's dead, I'm all alone. You said that you've bought me. I... Mother, why did you lead her here? Do you want me or not? You stay here, I'm going out to look for someone. Will you be back? I can't tell. Then I'll go with you. No, you can't. I'll be back. Wait for me here. Shoulderlength hair, pale face, he uses a sword. Have you seen him? No, I haven't. No? Thank you. Do you remember the murders in Beihe village? A life for a life. Your father's blood was sweet, ...what about yours? Try if you can. It's raining, My hair is wet. It's not convenient to kill. Let's change the place. You can pick anywhere to die. Come with me if you're not scared. It's no fun to play with swords. Pick whatever weapon you want. Sword it is, but with a burning candle. The one whose fire goes out, or the candle falls to the ground, then he's the loser. He must let the other kill him; no fighting back. Brother Wei. Close the door. You're hurt. There's blood all over. Don't worry, it's just a scratch. There's medication in the pack, please apply some for me. There's one more, Zuo Jinglong. Brother Wei, you still haven't recovered, ...you can walk slower. Brother Wei. Why won't you... take a good look at me? I dare not. Why not? You've already bought me. I don't want you to suffer by staying with me. I'm not scared. I can take any hardship. Xiangxiang. I've to kill my last enemy first... and find my elder sister. Till then I won't take a good look at anyone. Presently what I can just see... is the bad guys. They killed my parents, ...my younger brother. And my father too. They kidnapped my older sister. Brother Wei. We'll go to Jiangtong tomorrow, and to Haichiou the day after Come on... Welcome... come in please. Where have you been? No... You're late, drink up. Boss Zuo has orders, that's why we're late. Right. Sit down. With pleasure. I'll drink three cups first. Come on, cheers. Brother Wei. There's a change of plan. Someone betrayed us and leaked the news. What then? We'll do it tonight. We'll free our members from the jail. Alright. Boss Zuo will be the leader. Great. Head back to the inn first, I might not come back tonight. Go to Haichiou first all by yourself. We'll meet there, go. You must look for me. I promise I will. Take my pack with you. Go! What do you want? Don't you know we're here? Kill... He's killed them... Who's the killer? That's him. How dare you kill people in broad daylight? Drop the weapon. Arrest him. Yes.

Boss Zuo will come to free us sooner. You damn traitor. You must die here. Done. Drag him aside. Hey. I heard you killed four people in a rush. That's pretty impressive! When our leader comes to get us out, ...you can come with us; Or you'd rather stay here? What's the difference? If you follow us, you have money to spend, food and drinks. If you stay here, you will end up like him; Dead without even so much as a proper burial! Fine, I'll go with you. Great. Boss Zuo is here... Boss... Boss... Where's Chaizhao? He's dead. Great, get out everyone! Boss... Free everyone. Not you. Boss Zuo. He killed four of our men. What did you do that for? I'll kill whoever wants to kill me.

Let's test our skills in sword fighting. You think I can't use a sword, huh? That I'm going just good at bow and arrow? Get me a sword. I can't wait to see your skills. The Sixth Lady is here.
