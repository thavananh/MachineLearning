He punishes us with bolts from the sky. -But what did we do? -I don't know. [birds chirping] - (SINGING): I'm the greatest in all of mythology. Living the mythical life of ease. Throwing down lightning, I make no apologies. I'm Hercules. Though my thunder to some is alarming, it don't mean nothing but good, clean fun. I may scare them, but hey, there's no harm in it. I'm [inaudible] top gun. And I'll be god number one. I got the juice. I'm hotter, hipper, happening more than old Zeus-- he's getting stale. Give me one chance. I promise you I'll never fail. Check me out, how my strength is sensational-- one of the all-time bodacious bods. Brains and brawn and my Greek education will give me great odds that I'll be King of the gods. I'll be King of the gods. I don't mean to come off frightening. Don't mean to disturb the peace. Just trying to put some old grease lightning back into ancient Greece. -Whoo! -(LAUGHING): Watch this one. -Nice shot, Herc. -Yeah, and when Zeus finds out you dusted his statue, he's going to chain you to a rock for a million years. -Aw, he'll never find out. [thunder clap] -He found out. -Hercules! -So long. -Bye bye. -Uh, got to go. -Approach me, Hercules. -Yes, father? -You have angered me greatly. -What has he done this time? -He's been in my thunder bolts again. QUEEN HERA: When will you learn, Hercules? -I'm sorry. I just get so bored up here. -Gaze into the portal, my son, and witness the destruction you have wrought. See how the mortals must labor to rebuild their city? It will take many months to repair the damage you have caused. -I didn't think of that. -You are strong of arm, Hercules, but blind to the other strengths that make a man a hero. -Other strengths? What muscles could I want that I don't already have? -That is what you must learn. I, hereby, present you with these four challenges. Perform them all. Only then shall I grant you freedom to seek the adventure you crave. -Four challenges? I can think of 12 challenges, myself. The stables haven't been cleaned for centuries. -Now, Hera, he is young. Four challenges for now. -Humph! -At last, I get to see something more of the world than clouds. -You will go to these four places and no others. To take you there, I loan you Pegasus. Hercules, this is a dangerous journey. Be careful. And remember, power comes not only from your muscles, but from your mind and heart. May the luck of the gods be with you. [pegasus snorts] I hate when he does that. We're almost there, Pegasus! My first challenge is just ahead in the Village of Stymphales. -Umbrellas! Get your umbrellas here! Constructed of the finest hardwood. Don't risk your life another minute. -Quickly, I got-- I must have an umbrella. -Of course! We have 100 styles and 1,000 colors. -I don't care what color, just give me one. Hurry! -Thank you. Come again. -This is a strange town, Peg. They must get some awesome rain storms around here. -On the contrary. It never rains in Stymphalus. -Stranger still, a talking weasel. -That's sable, muscle boy! I'm a sable, not a weasel! Got it? -My apologies. -Next, you'll be wanting to know why I can talk. Right? -The question crossed my mind. -None of your business! -OK. I'll tell you. I used to be a gorgeous princess. Then one day, I just happened to mention that Aphrodite might be a little better-looking than Queen Hera. And blat! I'm a sable. So, you want to buy an umbrella? -But why would I want an umbrella in the middle of this desert? [gong] -How timely. -The birds! -The birds! -The birds! -The birds. -Last call for umbrellas! -I don't need an umbrella. -Ow! Don't say I didn't warn you! -I don't see any-- ah, the birds. [people screaming] [birds screeching] -Ugh! Uh! Why, Zeus' shorts! Peg! -Nooo, he doesn't need an umbrella. -I could shoot those birds with my bow and arrow, but there are so many! -So how many umbrellas will that be? I'll make you a deal-- three for the price of three. -You and your umbrellas have given me an idea! After those birds, Peg! -Higher! -Huh? Well, I'll be a-- a coat's collar. You did it, He-Man! -The name's Hercules. -Well, Herc, you've done what no one has ever done before-- you put me out of business! What were you thinking? -I'm sorry. -I may look like an overgrown rat, but I've got caviar tastes and champagne dreams. -Falina, wait! -I'm a princess. I wasn't born to grub. -Falina, wait a minute. I have three more challenges to face. Why don't you come along and help me? -What's the job pay-- after taxes? -Oh, there's no pay. -Surprise, surprise, surprise! -Except for the treasure I'm sure to find. -Consider me clocked in. -Hercules will need more than an uppity weasel to meet his remaining challenges. Wait until he beholds the Hydra. -You promised me treasure, and what do I get? Whoa! A free makeover into the Swamp Thing. Have you ever smelled a wet sable? They don't bottle it for cologne. -Shh. The Hydra could be close. I have to bring back a bottle of its venom to fulfill my second task. -Did you say, venom? -Right. The Hydra's venom is the most poisonous in the world. -Anything else? Flame-breath? Acid ear wax? Hey! Wait up! So where is this Hy-- ya-- ya-- ay-- ay-- ay-- ay? -Shh. I don't think he's seen us. -I'll wa-- wa-- wa-- wa-- wait for you b--b-- b-- back at the ch--ch-- ch-- chariot. -He's seen us. -Waaaaaao! -Uugh! Ugh! Uh. Umph! Huh? Uh. Uagh! -Ooh! Ah! Ee! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ah! Ah! Ee! Ee! Ooh! Ooh! -Falina, I need you! -Sorry, Falina is out. To leave a message-- yow! Ugh! Waaaaaao! -Stay with me and do what I say. -Like I have a choice? -Hop onto my shoulder. -Ah! -Other shoulder-- fast! Other side! -Any time you want to make up your mind-- -Other side! Perfect. [panting] -I give up. I'll meet you in the small intestine. -Look at the monster, Falina. -Hey! -Now, to get the venom! There! That wasn't so bad. -It was bad. Ahh. -Doing well, isn't he? -He's very lucky. -Skillful, my dear. Now let's see how he handles the Gorgon. -Herc, you've been holding out on me. Picking up treasure while my back was turned, eh? -No, just some souvenirs. -What? Stymphalean bird feathers? -Here. I need one feather polished so bright, I can see myself in it. -Oh, there's a treat. -Somebody around here has a strange taste in lawn ornaments. -These are no ornaments, Falina, but men turned to stone! My half-brother Percy has told me about this place and the Gorgon who lives here. She's so horrible, that looking into her eyes turns a man to stone. That's why I'm using this feather you polished as a mirror. -Seriously, Herc, you aren't half bad for a member of the male species. I'd hate to send you back to Zeus as a museum piece. Let somebody else destroy this Gorgon thing. -Oh, I don't have to destroy her. Besides, she's immortal-- can't be killed. We just have to pluck a hair from her head. -Oh, just pluck a hair-- from a monster that can turn you to stone? -Uh, that would be her now. -Yaaaaaa! Look at me, Hercules. -I know better than that, Gorgon. -Whooa! Ugh! -Just a little peek. -I see all I need to see in my mirror. -Not looking-- definitely not looking. -Just the glass then. Surely, a big, strong man like you isn't afraid. -I'm not afraid, but forewarned. -Objects in your mirror are closer than they appear, Hercules. Feel my hot breath on your neck. -Ugggh. Ugh! Uh! [screeching bird] Turn, Hercules. Turn and look into my eyes. -Don't do it, Herc! -Look at me! I'm not ugly, but beautiful! -Huh? The most beautiful woman your eyes have ever seen. Turn and see for yourself. -Turn and-- -Look into my eyes, Hercules! Look! -Must-- Nooooo! I will not fall under your spell. -You will, Hercules-- sooner or later. Your arrow does you no good. You can't shoot it. And even if you could, I am immortal. Nothing can harm the Gorgon. -Oh? -You see? You can't harm me! What magic is this? Getting sleepy. -It's safe now, Falina. -She's dead? -No, just sleeping. I dipped my arrows in the venom of the Hydra. Its magic couldn't kill her, but she'll sleep long enough to get what we came for. -So, our treasure, so far, includes some metal feathers, Hydra venom, and a limp snake. He promises treasure and delivers a yard sale. Do you even know what treasure is? -Well, the last challenge is to pick some golden apples. -Now it's apples. You expect a gorgeous princess like me to risk her life for-- did you say gold? -No! I won't have it! -Now, Hera. -Don't "Now, Hera" me! The Golden apples are mine! A wedding gift from Gaea, the Earth Mother! -Hercules does only what I have ordered. And I warn you, do not interfere. -I ask you-- Herc, have you ever seen anything so beautiful? It's like a picture. So perfect in its delicate tranquility. The sight brings a tear to the eye. -Those apples got to be worth a fortune! You've done so much. I'll handle this one. -Falina, wait! It can't be as easy as it looks! [sigh] -I'm going to be so rich! Even my fleas will have servants. Come to mama-- or not. Your choice. -Falina! Run! -Ru-u-u-u-u-u-n? I can't even st-a-a-a-a-nd! Huh? -Ow! -That's a big snake. Uh! Nooooo! Aaaaah! Ugh! [rattling] -Uh- oh. There's no place like home. There's no place like home! Yow! Waaaaao! Ugh! Uh! Wah! Ugh! Oh, ra! Uu--uu-- uu--uu-- u. Ah--ah-- ah--ah-- ah--ah-- ah--ah. Whoooa! Voggg! Ooh--ah-- ee. Ooh--ooh-- ooh-- ooh-- ah! Now what do we do? -"We" don't do anything. You are getting out of here. -Yaaaaah! Herc! H-- Herc? Noooo! -Well? What are you waiting for? I'm the one who came for the Apples, not the little one. -Yow! Yaaaaao! -It's meeee, you want, so take me. Go ahead and swallow me, but let my friend go free! -Don't worry, Hercules. -Huh? I won't be swallowing anyone. -Zeus? -Zeuuus? -You practically scared the toga off me! -I'm sorry, Hercules. But I did what had to be done. And now you have met all your challenges and demonstrated your many strengths. With the Stymphalean birds, you showed the strength of intelligence. With the Hydra, you showed the strength of teamwork. With the Gorgon, you demonstrated your strength of will. And now, you have clearly shown the strength of your courage, for you were willing to sacrifice yourself to save your friend. As your just reward, I will grant you one wish, Hercules. Name it, and it shall be yours. -I want only one thing-- for Falina to regain her true form. -So shall it be. -You! You-- you're beautiful! -What? You didn't believe me? -The earth is yours to explore, Hercules. The entire world beckons you. To carry you on your adventures, I give you Pegasus to keep as your own. Live well, Hercules. And remember the lessons you learned through these challenges. And one day, you shall be known as the greatest of all heroes. [theme music]
