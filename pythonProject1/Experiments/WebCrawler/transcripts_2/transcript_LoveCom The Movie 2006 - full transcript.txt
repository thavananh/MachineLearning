If this is the case, this someone is not meant for you. This someone is not your destiny. For destiny is... What do you want to tell me? Um... I... I'm in love with you! Sorry... I can't be your girlfriend? Because I'm your junior? It's because... ...you're taller than me. I'm sorry... But in return for your love, can I give you advice? If you don't want to get hurt, don't fall for... ...guys who are shorter than you. What do you want to tell me? Um... I'm in love with you. What? I'm in love with you. I want to know how you feel about me. Sorry... I can't be your boyfriend? Because I'm your junior? It's because... ...a couple looks funny when the guy is shorter than the girl. I'm sorry... This day, a boy and a girl, both deeply heartbroken by love. The girl, Risa Koizumi. Though, she's tall... The boy, Atsushi Otani. Though, he's short... The two who promised themselves that they'll never fall in love with someone not of matching height. Who'd have imagined that... ..these two would meet again and become their high school's All Hanshin Kyojin? No one could have! Lovely Complex 10th grade, spring "Suzuki-kun, I love you... Chiharu" Ryoji Suzuki (16) Chiharu Tanaka (16) Heikichi Nakao (16) - Nobuko Ishihara (16) Hey, darling, will you buy me this? What will you do for me in return? Let me see... Anything... - I'll buy it for you. - Really? Risa Koizumi (16) Koizumi... Keiichi Usui (42, single) Koizumi! Atsushi Otani (16) That's not enough to wake her up. Will you wake her up? You have to go like this to wake her. Ouch... Wake up, you idiot! Did you just kick my desk? That's what it takes to wake you up. Why do you have to? They're perfect for each other. No, we're not! And in perfect synch. No, we're not! Yes, you are. It's a coincidence! Don't copy me, Shorty! Don't call me "Shorty," Beanstalk! Don't talk like that to a lady! Don't talk like that to a gentleman! You're a gentleman? And you're a lady? Shut up, first grader! Shut up, volleyball player! Drink milk and grow taller! Get a plane and shave off some height! Start carrying kiddy backpacks! Shut up, Giant God Soldier! Me?! Why am I a character from "Nausicaa"?! You two, that's enough! Sorry... It is enough. You shouldn't get so edgy. It'll get humid inside your wig. This isn't a wig... This is not a wig... It was a... beautiful, sunny day. You shouldn't say things like that. Just pretend like you don't notice. You think so? This is so cute! Maybe I want this one instead. I don't care which, as long as you like it. Really? Great! Thank you! You shouldn't buy things for her without a special reason. It's not like that. I'm not her Daddy Long Legs. I just buy things for her. That's exactly the point. No! When he gives me things, I do things for him in return. What kind of things do you do? You know... I use my body. You use your body... When imagination runs wild, boys in their puberty may get a bloody nose. You use your body? Are you okay?! What did you picture in your mind? You're such a pervert! It's all your fault. Are you ready to order? Darling, try this one, just for fun. Give me a break... Who'd want to drink this? Excuse me! Yes? Hawaiian Dancer, please. They would. Don't copy me. You're the one copying me. You guys really are perfect for each other. I don't believe that. You should just go with each other to see if it'd work out. Why would I have to go with someone who'd remind me of my height? I don't want a shorty like you either. You don't have the right to choose, Beanstalk. If I really wanted one, I could get a boyfriend anytime. I'd like to see you do it. I will then! I'll show you what I'm capable of! I'm going to find a boyfriend within a week! There are things we can do, and there are things we can't. That's right. Please hook me up with someone! Was that your plan? I know you can find someone! Please! I suppose I could... So, what kind of guy do you want? Someone tall. The taller, the better. Tall guys are hard to come by. I don't care what he's like, just as long as he's tall. Please! The Prince of the School Name: Risa Koizumi Ideal type: 175 cm or taller Accept Kane: Welcome to my school! What are you doing?! Older sister, Rie Koizumi (22) What are you doing?! I'm going to watch TV. I'm playing a game. Watch it in your own room. My TV's broken. "Hello, Girlfriend" Welcome to our show. Very cute! How embarrassing! You didn't come from your house dressed like this, did you? Of course I did. You came dressed like this? You know how I always watch this. I don't know that! What is this?! It's "Hello, Girlfriend." Girls go on the show to boast about their boyfriends. What do you like about your boyfriend? He always relies on me. Relies on you? The guy relies on the girl? Like how? Like "Shizuko, lend me 10,000 yen"... Or "Shizuko, lend me 30,000 yen." When I watch this, I feel like I'm melting. She's just gloating! Gross! I bet you want to go on it. I'd disgrace our family! But you couldn't get a boyfriend in the first place. And you're one to talk. You don't think I have a boyfriend? What?! You have one?! I'll leave it up to your imagination. Why are you being so secretive? Tell me! Why are you being so secretive?! It's time for your song! "Diamond" by Princess Princess! "I found some tall guys"... Yes! Let me introduce you to... Takashi and Takumi. Hello. Their average height is 190 cm! We'll be right back. What are those mysterious creatures? You said anything goes just as long as they're tall. Yes, they are tall but they're also out of the question! Calm down... They said they have a friend coming. Really? So there's still hope. There he is. Otani! Over here! You're tall. How tall are you? 170 cm. Then maybe you'll be over 3 meters by the time you graduate high school. How tall do you think I am? I don't know... It's a secret! You can touch my banana. Telephone... I'll be right back. Don't ever come back! He gives me goose bumps... What are you doing? Your seat's over there. You wouldn't mind if that guy sits here again? I don't need you to worry about me. Then fine. Please stay! I beg you! Why didn't you say that from the beginning? This song...! "Is This All Right?" Is this all right? Is this all right? It's my song! No, it's mine! - No, I put it in! - I did! - I did! - I did! What is this song? It's Umibozu! Who's that? All my life, people have called me fool But I've been roughed up by Japan's tough society That's why I have the right to say Can't say, can't see, can't show Don't know even when it's so close But that's love, love, let's love Carp in the pond that can't see love So close, so close So close but you don't realize What's going to happen to this love? I want to tell you but I won't Is this all right? Is this all right? The story continues The karaoke is over I didn't know you were an Umibozu fan. I didn't know you were either! I was so surprised! But how could those idiots not know Umibozu?! Really! Hey, give me your cell phone number and email address. Why? Don't get me wrong. What do you mean? When we hear news on Umibozu, we can let each other know. Yeah, you're right. We're two of his very few fans! Yes, we are. I'm going to use the infrared light. Good. Are you ready? Yeah. Sending! Receiving! I got it. Okay, now send yours. Okay, my turn. Sending! Receiving! - Got it? - I got it. - Perfect. - Good. 10th grade, winter Koizumi! Look at this! Christmas concert?! You got tickets?! Yeah, it was a miracle! Good job! You're short, yet amazing. Now, ask me to take you. Why do I have to ask? There are other people besides you who'd want to go. Like who? Who wants to go to the Umibozu concert with me on Christmas night?! So you're going to the concert with Otani on Christmas night. But not because I want to. You guys are like a couple. No! I'm just doing him a favor. Nakao... Kanzaki? Hi. Long time no see. What do you want with my darling? Um... Atsushi Otani... Has he gone home already? Otani? I think he's still here. Do you want me to go get him? No, it's okay... Will you give him a message though? Sure. What's the message? Our junior high basketball team is having a Christmas party... so will you ask him if he can come? When is it? On the 25th. 25th? Tell him I want to talk to him about something too, so I hope he can make it. Sorry! On the 25th, Otani is... We're in his class, so we'll give him the message. Risa... We'll tell him. Thank you very much. Who is she? Otani's ex-girlfriend. Otani's... Ex-girlfriend? So did you break up with her? Or did she break up with you? That's a good question. What happened was... Why are you talking? He's saying it for you because you seem uncomfortable saying it. She broke up with me. She fell in love with someone else. I knew it. So what did she want? Your old basketball team's getting together for Christmas on the 25th. And she wants to talk to you about something. About what? She didn't say. But I heard she broke up with her new boyfriend. Then she probably wants to get back together with you. Are you still in love with her? Of course not! Come on... I bet you're still not over her. I am over her! His face says he's still not over her. With mammals, you can tell how they feel by looking at their mouth. So what are you going to do on the 25th? I can't go. Why not? I'm going to the Umibozu concert with her... You should go. You should go see her if you're still not over her. Don't be stupid. Then who would you go to the concert with? Don't worry about me. I don't want you to blame me if you couldn't get back together with her. And there are tons of guys who'd want to go to the concert with me. Really? Really. Don't worry about it. Okay, if you say so. I say so. I ended up coming alone... And I'm here so early since I had nothing else to do... I wonder what everyone's doing... Nobu must be at Nakao's house, enjoying a gorgeous Christmas feast... Chiharu and Suzuki must be... Experiencing their first kiss. But when they try to kiss... they hit their glasses against each other, and they laugh... and then they'd take them off... Ouch. My stockings ripped! And I'm bleeding! I look like a fool, and I'm in pain... I don't believe this! Excuse me. Yes...! People meet their knights in shining armor at times like this. Yes? Will you take a photo of us? Please? Okay, Marilyn. Smile when I say "cheese." Are you ready? What am I doing? The concert's starting soon, but my leg hurts. Everyone's a couple, but I'm all alone. What am I doing? This is hilarious... Really hilarious... Thank you... Let's go. I'm going home. Koizumi! Koizumi! Hey! Otani? I found you at last... What are you doing here? Nobu called me and told me you went alone. Why'd you come? Why? To see the Umibozu concert with you. What else? I'm glad I made it on time. What about your ex-girlfriend? I didn't go. Why not? Because I made this promise with you first. It's true I was tempted... But I thought it wouldn't be the right thing to do. You sure you don't have to go see your ex-girlfriend? I don't want to owe you either. You're an idiot. Shut up. A real idiot. Why are you crying? I'm not crying. Hey... Come on... Why are you crying? Oh my God! You're bleeding! And it's ripped. It's the fashion. You're lying. Let's go to the drug store. I'm fine. The concert's going to start. No, we have to disinfect that first. - But... - Let's go. Come on! Let's go. It's pretty, huh? Yeah, it is. Kane: Are you perhaps in love with me? Confess your love Yes / No What are you doing?! What are you doing?! I'm going to watch TV. Not again... I give up. So you like him? No. I love him! The hottest couple in the universe! I really want to go on this show. You couldn't. Is that what you think? Why are you snickering at me? You're in love with someone, aren't you? No...! Don't be stupid. I can tell. You smell like love. You're kidding, right? I don't care what anybody says. Shin'ichi is gorgeous! Now for your song. Puffy's "Signs of Love"! Enjoy! 11th grade, spring Love works in mysterious ways. He was just another classmate, until Risa realized, she was in love with him. Now, he is a shining star. When he is in gym class... When he is eating his lunch. His omelette... When he's cleaning his classroom... When he's about to sneeze. His sneeze... My heart's going to burst. Look, look! Isn't Otani so cute?! He's very cute! Does he have a girlfriend? I hear he and his classmate Risa Koizumi are really close. She can't be his girlfriend. She's taller than him. You're right. He wouldn't go with someone taller than him. They'd be like a comic duo. Right? So he must be available. Should I go for him? You should! We'd look ridiculous... A comic duo... 11th grade, summer Hey... Do you want to invite Otani and go to the festival with us tomorrow? Festival? I'll make sure you have the opportunity. The opportunity for what? Of course, to tell Otani that you're in love with him. You've got it all wrong. I'm not in love with him... Everyone already knows. You're kidding. Are you serious? It's so easy to trick you. I admit that I am in love with him. But I can't tell him. Why not? He'd reject a giant like me. You don't know that for sure. The difference between our heights is the size of this fork. It's such a small difference, but to me, it's a huge wall. A huge wall I can't overcome. You're an idiot. What do you mean?! I'm being serious. Look at that. The size of the fork is the same. It's so small. Risa... Are your feelings for Otani so small that you can't even jump over a fork? You love who you love. What's wrong with that? Don't you think so? I get so excited when I come to places like this! Should I get a crepe? Or a chocolate-covered banana? Oh no... My heart's about to burst. You have to just do it, like you're showing him your boobs in your mind. I can't show him my boobs. I said "in your mind." Now go! What should I do? There're so many things I want to eat. Chiharu, you look really good in a "yukata." Yeah, you all look good. Really? It feels so breezy. It does, because you're not supposed to wear any underwear. Oh yeah? Oh yeah?!! Yes... Um... Right now... I'm not wearing any panties. No panties... When imagination runs wild, boys in their puberty may get a bloody nose. Nothing at all...? There he goes. A bloody nose... Oh my God! Let's stop somewhere! Darling, help him out. You okay? We'll come with you. Don't worry! We'll be right back, so go on ahead. I need tissues. Why'd she say that? What should we do? Since we're here, we might as well have fun. You're right. So where should we go first? Good luck! Oh no! Why?! Are you aiming? I lost... Chocolate-covered banana! Hey! Come on! You got it! Wow! You got it! Wow! Look at them! They're so pretty! I'm going to take a photo. You too. Okay, say "cheese"! Before confessing love... The more a girl is enjoying the moment, the more she becomes anxious. Once she's confessed, the smile might disappear from the boy's face... Once she's confessed, she might change the world forever. Festivals are so much fun. Goldfish scooping! Koizumi, let's go goldfish scooping! I guess we could... Great! All right... Here... Good luck. All right, here I go! I'll scoop, so you hold the bowl, okay? A real man wouldn't go for the small ones, but for the biggest. Impossible. If you say that before you even try, you'll never accomplish anything. If he catches that big goldfish... I'm going to tell him how I feel. If he can't catch it, it's a sign that I shouldn't say anything. Here goes. Yes! I got it! The bowl! Oh no... It ripped. Too bad. I was so close. It must be a sign to give up... What's wrong? Usually you'd tell me to try again. No, I wouldn't... Is something wrong? Otani? Kanzaki! It's been a long time. Yeah, it has... You two came alone? We were with our friends, but we got separated, right? Who is he? He's so cute! He's Otani, a classmate from junior high. Otani... As in your ex-boyfriend? See you. Hey... Why didn't you go see her last Christmas? Eri, don't... What do you mean? You haven't gotten over that, right? It's okay... I feel bad enough. Bad enough for who? You feel bad for her? But you're not his girlfriend, are you? Eri! It's so obvious. She's taller than him. Them two would look too weird walking side by side. There's no way. She's my girlfriend! This is my girlfriend. You're kidding. It doesn't matter who's taller than who. If we're in love with each other, it doesn't matter if people laugh at us! See you... Let's go. Sorry. Hey... Why did you say that back there? You know, there's a reason I started playing basketball. What reason? I was rejected by a girl who was taller than me... so I wanted to get back at her. When I first started, people told me I was too short to play the sport. But I'm a starter now. Height doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Fireworks! Wow... They're pretty! Otani! What?! I... I'm in... I'm in love with you! I'll never forgive you for that day! 11th grade, school festival I'm going to haunt you until your great-grandchildren's generation! I'm going to haunt you forever! Suzuki-kun! Are you okay?! Let me go! Get your hands off me! You know, you look way too real. But it's a haunted house, right? Yes, but you're overdoing it. You're always angry these days. What's wrong? You should know the answer! Otani! What?! I... I'm in... I'm in love with you! Stop joking around! You just tried to trick me, didn't you? You're teasing me because I told you about the tall girl who rejected me. No, I didn't mean it like that... Stop lying! You almost got me. You're so dangerous! Whaaat?! Let's watch it again. I... I'm in love with you! Interval 1 Interval 2 Interval 3 Interval 4 Stop joking around! He's absolutely convinced that she's just joking. You just tried to trick me, didn't you? Mr. Otani here is a very dense creature. You're so dangerous! And to make things worse... Whaaat?! He doesn't think of her as a female. The densest guy in the universe I don't know what you're talking about! Shrink! I hope Otani shrinks a centimeter each day! Stop it, will you?! You're freaking everyone out! And suffer! What's wrong with her? Koizumi! What are you doing? The afternoon session is starting. Don't worry. I'll go back. Why are you crying? I'm not crying. Yes, you are. Why? Because I told a guy I loved him, but he brushed it off as a joke. Really? Do you want me to go talk to him? Forget it. Why? Who is this guy anyway? Where is he now? Here. Here? He's right in front of my eyes, you idiot! Me? Who else is here? Are you serious? Um... Will you let me think about it? I know how you feel now... so I'll let you know how I feel. Please. What did I just do? There's an important issue before we continue this juvenile love story. I just bought this Ultra Hair Deluxe New Type X. 450,000 yen. Ever since I switched to this, nobody has noticed I'm wearing a wig. Very natural. Off to work! He's thinking real hard. At least, he knows how she feels. Now this question from the following sentence. Anyone? Otani. I'm still thinking. You should know the answer to this! It's not that I don't know. I'm just thinking. You're acting oddly these days. That's not true. I'm your teacher. I should know! What's really odd is your wig. This isn't a wig... It's not odd... Has Otani given you a reply? Not yet. How many days has he been thinking? Longer than my mom's constipation. This is really scary! How long do I have to bear this? Don't worry, Risa. I'm sure it'll be out before the school trip. Which will? I don't want to go tomorrow. Then shall I go in your place? I'm sure people will find that very strange! Despite how I look... ...I'm still a teenager at heart and in my head. You're in trouble if you're still a teen in your head. Will you get out of here? Ouch... If I really wanted to, I could knock you out in one blow. Try it if you can! I have great bone density. Bone density? What are you talking about? Come on, do it! Your defense is weak! Shut up! I'm not scared of you! How am I supposed to act during the school trip? Where are you?! I'm so sorry! Everyone already left on an earlier flight. I'm really sorry. You didn't ask anyone to wake you up? Everyone in my family overslept, and my cell phone was in vibrate mode. Both of you... Really...! Both of us? Whaaat?! A storm of awkwardness attacked the two through the whole span of their flight. It seemed as if they were flying all the way to Brazil. Shock! What were you guys doing? Did you talk to Koizumi? Leave me alone. How was it? I want to go home. You're with everyone now. Yeah, don't worry about it anymore. You're right. No need to worry... You're kidding! "We tried to wake you but you didn't, so we left"? I don't believe this! I don't believe this! Yes... Yes, I understand. Where are they? They'll be back in about an hour, so we're free until then. Free? Just us? What should we do? I don't know... Street Racer Big Bro This is such a nice town! Really! Yeah, Koizumi?! It feels great! Our driver is really fast! He is! You're so cool! You're the man! Japan's best! Number one! Keep it up, Big Bro! Thank you! Thanks! Thanks to me, we caught the robber. You're right. Thanks to someone's brutal strength. Leave out the "brutal," Shorty. Shut up, Beanstalk. We only have five more minutes. Should we head back? Hold on. Let's go to that souvenir shop over there. Then I'll go buy some juice first. Okay, then I'll meet you there. I'm having so much fun. It's been a while since I had this much fun. Yeah... Otani and I are better off horsing around like this. Yeah... I'll ask him to forget my confession of love. Then we can go back to how we were. What are you doing? I found the bear curry that a friend wanted me to bring back. Bear curry? It sounds gross. It's supposed to be a delicacy. I thought about it a lot. About what? If you asked me if I loved or hated you, I'd say I love you. But we've been like a team for such a long time... So I can't suddenly think of you as a girlfriend. I'm sorry... How creepy! "I'm sorry"? Stop looking so serious. What do you mean "creepy"? But great timing! I was just about to say the same thing. Will you forget what I said to you? Are you serious? Yes! Let's get over this uncomfortable atmosphere. Koizumi... Hurry up and buy your bear or sea lion curry or whatever. We better get back or they'll leave us again. See you! Wait, Koizumi...! Gosh... He was so straightforward... it really hurts... Risa, we're going to change our agenda for the class trip. It's now going to be Risa and Nobu's pig-out tour! You're not going to have time to think about Otani... ...because we're going to be eating all the time. I'm not going to worry about my weight or body fat. Yeah, let's binge tomorrow. Yes! And when we go back, I'm going to find things I hate about Otani. Things you hate? To think about it, there're so many things I hate about him. Like what? He sleeps with his eyes half-open during class. Gross! His hobby is collecting shopping points. Cheapskate! He trips on flat surfaces. Klutz! His ringtone is an outdated gag. "Gets"! Yeah, that one! If I can't be his girlfriend, it's meaningless to stay in love with him. I'm going to make myself hate him! I'm going to push my heart's reset button! Yeah, just delete the guy from your memory! Risa, be tough! Kane: Why do you look so glum? It's not like you. Risa: My feelings won't listen to me. Direct all those feelings toward me and smile like you always do. How weird... My sister's not here today. So let's hear what she likes about her boyfriend. You do love him of course? Yes, I do. So much that I want to suck him dry down to his bones. Sister! Why are you on this?! What do you love about him? He has a huge pot belly, and his face is really oily... and his eyes look like a criminal's and they're really gross. That's the parts you don't like about him, aren't they? That's what I like about him. What are you saying?! You must be a very unusual person. Have you fallen in love with me? This is rather scary, like being stabbed. What are you saying?! Stop it right now! Now for your song! Lindberg's "Kiss Me Right Now"! I spotted your leather jacket from the footbridge... And you can't even sing! I can't get my heart... to stop... racing... 12th grade, spring There's an important issue before we continue this juvenile love story. I just bought this Ultra Hair Deluxe Super Light! 750,000 yen. This time for sure, nobody will notice I'm wearing a wig. Thank you, Ultra Hair Deluxe Super Light! Off to work! - Hey! - Good morning. Hey... Same class again? Yeah... Let's have fun again, huh? Sure... Good morning! Morning! Mr. Usui...? Is that a new wig? This isn't a wig... It's not a wig... What new wig...? Who's that? Mr. Usui... I know how hurt you must be, but the introduction please... Yes... I'm sorry. This is Mr. Kuniumi Maitake, the new assistant homeroom teacher. Kuniumi Maitake (30, raised uptown) My name is Maitake. Everyone... Today... Yoroshi QUEEN! ("Nice to meeeet you") Oh man! Mr. Kane... Is this the princess's glass slipper? Yes... This is mine. And it's an eraser. Oh, I'm sorry. It was your eraser, Shorty. Don't call me Shorty! He really is Mr. Kane... Why are you so pissed off? It's no use getting mad. Stop it. He gets on my nerves! He greeted us with "Yoroshi QUEEN"! He called an eraser a glass slipper. What kind of guy is that? Yoroshi QUEEN! What are you doing here?! I'm the team's new coach. What?! I swear he looks just like him! Okay, so he looks like that Kane guy... I can't believe this is happening! Anyway, how are things with Otani? What about him? I don't care about him at all anymore... I know you still feel the same way about him. That's not true! - Yes, it is! - That is not true... Why are you trying so hard? What's so wrong about loving him? But I don't know what to do. It's easy. Love him much, much more. Love him with all your heart and do everything you can. Oh... Did you already buy him a present? Present for what? He's the new captain of the basketball team. He is? Then use the present as an opportunity to change into an aggressive Risa! But... Listen... A present is the remedy for love. A present... What's that? None of your business. Okay. Hey! Will you wear this if I gave it to you for being chosen as the new captain? I'm just kidding. I wouldn't give it to you. I'm giving this to someone else. But I won't tell you who. Then I hope you give it to him... I want to give it to you... I can't ignore a student when she's crying. Mr. Maitake... Tears don't suit you. Why don't you direct all your feelings toward me? You really are Mr. Kane... Ready, go! Go, fight! Go, lovely! Go, sexy! One more time! Ready, go! Go, fight! Go, lovely! Go, sexy! Good. The beginning is really critical. Let's get it right! Yeah! What are you guys doing? We started the Maity Team today. Maity Team? What's that? You mean... For him? Yes. The Maity Team for Mr. Maitake. Active starting today! Huh? Go, Maity! Go! Let's go!

You have no right to tell me what to do. Oh yeah? Excuse me then. How frustrating. Your shots are unstable. You have to concentrate harder. You don't have to tell me. I already know. You already know, do you? It doesn't look like it. What do you mean? Koizumi is a nice girl. She has nothing to do with this. Why you? If I were a girl, I wouldn't want a short boyfriend like you. If you don't do something about her, someone's going to take her away. Who's that someone? You really like Maity that much? I do. What about Otani? I thought you were going to hang in there until he responds. Mr. Maitake would never say anything that'd hurt me. That's why I like him. - You're just running away. - No. Just because Otani won't return your love. No! Risa, something happened. Are you seriously playing basketball against Mr. Maitake tomorrow? I am. Maity played in the national tournament. How are you going to beat him? 3-on-3, my specialty. It'll be an easy win. But Maity said he's bringing some strong teammates... I already found 2 strong teammates too. Impossible! You'll never win! Don't even try. Get everyone to come watch him make a fool out of himself. Otani! You must be an idiot! Yeah, I know that! I'm an idiot and a shorty. Why don't you cheer him on? Your beloved Mr. Maity... I will... You don't have to tell me! So many people are here to watch the game. Good, he'll be more embarrassed. Can I ask you a question? Your strong teammates are... Why us? You guys are all I need to beat that idiot. But we're beginners... You can still change your mind. I won't do that! I'm going to make her watch Maity make a fool out of himself. Go, go, Maity! Let's go Maity! Go, go, Maity! Let's go Maity! The winner is the team with more points at the end of 10 minutes. Should I take a handicap, Shorty? I'd like to ask you the same thing. Go, go, Maity! Let's go Maity! Just as you wished, I'm going to cheer for Mr. Maitake with all my heart. Suzuki! Suzuki-kun! Suzuki! Over here! Watch out! I got it! Yes! Can I start playing seriously now? I suppose his friendliness is national level. Otani vs Maity Otani! Are you okay? Are you okay? We can stop the game. This will be my handicap for you. Go, go, Maity! Let's go Maity! Otani vs Maity Would you like to give up? Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! It's over... Go, go, Maity! Let's go Maity! Otani... Did you want to see Otani like that? Is this what you wanted? Are you sure this is it? What's this? After all this, are you still going to root for that man?! You idiot! Why are you giving up?! Height doesn't matter, right?! Even if you can't win, play your game! Even if you can't win... ...make me feel excited! Me, the girl who loves you! "I LOVE MY SHORTY" Risa...! It's so tacky... If you had that tacky thing already, you should have taken it out earlier. It fires me up! I forgot that an idiot has to play an idiot's game. We're going to score 30 points in the next minute! Come, Shorty! You idiot! Looks can be deceiving! I don't believe this! Yay! Otani vs Maity Did you just see that?! He did it, Risa! Take good care of her... Yoroshi QUEEN. It was a good game. No way! We were creamed. That's true. Completely and utterly clobbered. Shut up. Hey... What? I need you with me after all. I need you to be with me. What do you mean by that? Can't you at least smile? What was that? It tasted like fried noodles. You idiot... Don't be stupid. Let's go. Koizumi, let's go. God doesn't show you your destiny. That's right. You'll realise your destiny when you succeed to change yourself. You'll realise that your destiny was beside you, all along. All right, let's go! When you find your destiny, repeat after me. Yoroshi QUEEN! Narration: Kuniumi Maitake Hello, Otani? I'm going to be a little late. Will you wait for me there? What's his name? Otani! Otani? Okay... Now tell him, who's watching you on TV, that you love him with a song! Otani! I'm totally in love with you! Now for her song. Misono's "Speedrive"! Idiot! "Trip to Hawaii for two" See you next week! Bye! She finally has a boyfriend. What a happy ending. It sure is. Who are you? Your boyfriend! That's a real bad joke. You're vicious...
