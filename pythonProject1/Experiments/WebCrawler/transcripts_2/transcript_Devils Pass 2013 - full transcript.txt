foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- These are the facts : In February 1959, nine hikers Russians traveled to the Urals . Two weeks later, All were found dead . The fact became known as the Step Dyatlov incident . - OK , I'm recording . - My name is Holly King . I am a student of psychology at the University of Oregon. In 2008 I saw a bulletin newspaper about 30 elite scientists who gathered in a remote area of the Ural Mountains in Russia . They were trying to solve a mystery that had puzzled the world for nearly 50 years . He was known as " The Dyatlov Pass Incident " by the leader of the expedition 1959, named Igor Dyatlov . They were unsuccessful , but was intrigued its history . So when my favorite teacher , Dr. Kittles , instructed our class a project on that incident in particularly , I could not believe it. I mentioned it to a friend of mine , Jenson , a film student here, and he said we should make a movie. Then , request a grant, and ... Got it ...! OK , then ... tell us what happened. I first heard about this incident when a Russian journalist Yuri Yarovoi , published a fictionalized version of it in a book. "From Highest Level of Complexity by Yuri Yarovoi . " Of course , he was sent to kill. " The Russian writer Yuri crashed Yarovoi on an empty street on January 28, 1980 . " That is, no matter it would fictionalized . Do not want anyone Dyatlov spoke . And I started to use the facts of the incident as exercises in psychology class because there is so much to know happened in the Dyatlov Pass , many details ... and yet , the whole thing remains shrouded in mystery. What are the explanations that heard more often ? The most common explanations termed " scientific " is a condition called hypothermic dementia ... Dementia hypothermic yes, that 's what it says around the world , literally. But my favorite ... ... is called ... " desabrigo paradoxical " . Become disoriented , think they have much warmth and begin to undress. -Holly! There were nine experienced backpackers - Yes Are you telling me all suffered severe hypothermia ... ... at the same time, the same night? - Could be. They had been out for three days. Why then? An avalanche is another common response . That's even more stupid ... ... that " desabrigo paradoxical " . - Why? If you heard an avalanche , why is away from the camp for three hours without boots? But in reality , there are countless answers to the question , most of my students screened their own fears in it , Is the Russian army ? I hope my students proposed more that a credible explanation ... I want to get in the Instead of these people , so can understand why victims did what they did . That's the answer I'm looking for. Are we going to find the truth ? - Although they are not going to find. - What do you mean ? There is no truth . The first part of our journey takes us Eugene , Oregon , in Chelyabinsk , Russia. You will not use that stupid red dotted line to show our journey is not it? Error! Our final destination is the Kholat Syakhl , literally translated as " The Mountain of the Dead " . Really. It is the name Mansi tribe gave due to the many mysterious deaths and disappearances along history. So ... ... find an engineer Audio , Denise Evers . It was the only audio operator on campus that meet the requirements ... physical . There are plenty of lean subjects devoted to audio. Huh? What 's wrong with lean subjects ? Oh , sorry ! My mistake . And then we find two guides capable. I'm Andy Thatcher , president of the Northwest Association Excursions ... I climbed mountains almost all U.S. , also toured the SA - Sorry, what? - The Appalachian Trail . It stretches from Maine to Georgia, took me all summer. - So you think you are qualified for this - Yes Why do you want to do this , Andy ? As I said , as I climbed all scalable in the U.S., 's time for a new challenge. - Are you afraid ? - No Really? You know, we're recreating a trip that killed 9 people . Yes , 50 years ago . Come on! Not even if the Abominable Snowman ... -" Yeti " ! - He is dead . - And you are ... ? - He is JP Hauser . - JP . - That's right. And you think you're ready for this? Amiga, spent a year in the Himalayas. He's ready. - Really? - Yes - I took a little time . - Enough time . How .. " Hauser "? How to " Hauser Hall "? As the building we have right in front The same . That reminds me I have to go to Philosophy . See you later. Now that we had our team was time to work . We study the maps, prepare the equipment , together rations , supplies ... and then trained on mountains in the area. We were encouraged and eager to leave. - I hate these damn snowshoeing. - You look so great with them , Jenson . Hey ! I can wait a little ! Almost as much as I hate him . Shit ! And now , January 25 ... ... is time to leave. The search for five students Oregon missing last month in the Ural Mountains . Remember that three days before the Rescuers found items apparently belonged to students, as tents, backpacks and other equipment . Our Russian correspondent , Ivan Kudryavtsev , the Russia 24 news channel , has more details . Good afternoon, Ivan Kudryavtsev and you are watching channel Russia 24 . Continue covering the event that captures the international media attention and is the country 's most talked news . The mysterious disappearance of a group of American documentary in the Urals which , as you may know , followed the steps of issuing Igor Dyatlov , whose nine members were killed in mysterious circumstances in 1959 . The experts handle various theories to explain the disappearances. The weather here can be dangerous , the temperature can drop to -50 ? and winds are brutal . Wind can change direction in an instant. At the top the wind blows towards the west and a little further down east. So when someone goes up the mountain and believes that it is moving in a straight line actually go completely in the other direction . We do not know how prepared they are for climatic conditions of northern Russia . I think they made contact with aliens a ship or something ... There have been many curious events area in recent years . The more I study the site, meeting more mysterious signals ... ... and sinister , even mystical . There are so many unexplained mysteries in that area feed such theories , even the mystical ... are understandable as long there are stories objects that bear witness in heaven, and to this day there are common the stories of the yeti footprints . Also a native tribe in the area, Mansi , have their own theory. Mansi Elders recall that when Dyatlov group disappeared , There were loud noises and strange unexplained fireballs over the mountains We believe that in that place ... ... two worlds collide. You can move from one world to the other ... That's where you enter the world of spirits . Russia Channel 24 will continue to report on recent disappearances north of the Urals with 5 U.S. hikers mysteriously vanished in the same place where, in 1959 , the group Igor Dyatlov met his death . Thank you, Ivan. Students were recreating the failed journey undertaken by Igor Dyatlov and 8 other hikers Russians 50 years ago for a documentary . The track was found most promising a camera recording equipment . They studied the recordings without make them known to the public, but today, a group of hackers calling itself conspires - Leaks had access to recordings and rose to their internet site . I opened the door and darkness followed me , like my dream Hey , come on. Hey , hey, hey . - It was a dream , just a dream ... - Forgive . Jenson ,never get out of here! Forgive me ... A month before . We landed in Russia and the next part Our journey takes us from Chelyabinsk to the Ural Mountains to a town called Ivdel . Cute tattoo, you got the other wing , or just one? - Only one, and it hurt like shit. Surely . Do you have any other, something you want to show on camera ? In your dreams , pervert. And that phone ?

I still remember him shouting when he returned later. Proceed . Did not take long to find the other bodies A trail ... ... a trail of bodies ... Found two ... ... and a woman ... next to the tree where they had made a fire . There are two and four more in the gorge. We were sad , but not surprised , when we discover there were no survivors . But the scene was so strange . I felt ... that people were nervous . I also felt , that something was wrong with this place . I went out , I just wanted to leave that place. That's when I found two more , on the north side . There was something strange about them , stranger than the others. And some ... ... near them , in the snow. A machine ! - As strange ... - Excuse me . Come on ... Let's cut a minute. Then , they found 11 bodies . - Yes - Are you sure? I know what I saw , young lady. I'll never forget .

I will leave in the next road. We do not know how to thank you , Sergei. -I told you ! - What do we say? Aliens ! What else could it be? What about the military ? You yourself said you were doing an experiment at the time. - Well , I change my vote to " aliens" . - Yes, that makes much more sense , Jenson And you, Andy ? What do you think of the theory Jenson alien ? - Stupid . - Is it pretty solid , eh ? I do not think Andy agrees with your theory . What matters! Do not you think you shot me enough? Shoot the mountains. You are much more interesting , JP . Andy ! Denise does not remove eyes off her . Yeah, it's like saying :Oh , Jesus ! What an idiot ! So is it as expected ? - Yes -Oh , yes ! JP ! Any last words ? Is that it ? - That 's what? - " Kholat Syakhl " Yes. The Mountain of the Dead ! Jesus! As you can see , the weather changes fast, and changed . My racquet again! What a piece of shit! - I will not die here . - Better leave before nightfall. - The climate will change. -Jenson ! -Yo! -Only one more take ! -Come on ! Friends , this is fantastic . So, Mr. Hauser , tell about cooking at camp. Well, I like to keep it simple and light as possible . Therefore ... ... I bring you ... Mountain Chili dehydrated. Delicious . You know I'm vegetarian , right? - Really? - Yes - I do not know ... have macaroni and cheese , huh ? -Mmm ! Right. So what we do is boil water. You are using snow , right? Yes We need to conserve fresh water . but do not worry : the boiling kills bacteria. - This smells amazing . - JP , you're a master of the kitchen ... Wait ...so there ! ... you burn your mouth. Idiot ! Why did you give me , if you knew it was hot ? - I still do not feel like anything. - It is true . -Surprise for everyone! - What is ? Chocolate ? ? - It looks good . - You had all this time?

Yes , very ... cute . - How is your tongue ? - Well . You know, if you're interested the aurora borealis, Denise tent is over there Believe it or not , I'm not spying Denise at this time. OK , what are you doing? In the week before the incident , there reports of orange lights in the sky . Six witnesses completely different. -Aliens ! - I think the majority. The official response was : " Unusual atmospheric conditions ." The moon reflecting off the clouds , things like that . - But you do not believe that. -Hey ! They should go to sleep! Start early . Should reach destination tomorrow. -OK! - What? The big day . Yeah I'll just ... see that. OK . What was that ? What was what ? That sound ! Forget it. -Holly! Arise ! - What? -Something was here ! You gotta see this ! - It's just a joke Jenson . -Fuck you ! -What the hell ...! - OK , we're recording . - Denise ? - I do not like . Denise , if something would happen, have happened last night. You can not know . Do not expose to danger . Strange, but we have to film it , OK? All right , whatever. Can you wait a minute? Thank you ! You're an idiot . OK . We woke up this morning and found something strange. Treads between these two rocks and around the tents . They have a strange way . Do you see how big is that ? And the other is even bigger. Two pairs , two different people. -Oh ! People? - I'm not talking about the Yeti , Jenson . Come on! Look at the size of those footprints ! What else could it be? I do not know ! A bear, a tiger in the snow ... - What? Snow tiger ? ? -The Snow Tiger is extinct , brainiac ! What is even more bizarre : Anyone walking in this type of snow , need special boots . They have to have good grip , so they have to have soles with nails or well marked channels . But these tracks are soft . About have been , were barefoot . Andy tells us that , with the low temperatures there at night, - ... Fingers freeze them in 10 minutes. - Which would explain the Yeti . -It's not the damn Yeti ! - How do you know ? -Because there are Yetis damn ! -You do not exist ! -By God , Jenson ! OK , let's record . None of the tracks out or go to camp. It is as if something had fallen from the sky , walked barefoot around us while we slept , and then flew off. - Does the Yeti flies? - Hello , Mike . - Hello. Can we pack? - Here's Tigers snow? - There is no fucking tiger here . Ven. Do not have to cross that, right? No. - You all right? They were quiet all morning. - Yes , we're fine. - There seem to be fine . - We do not like that we fuck , that's all . Do they think I'm kidding ? No, thought Bigfoot was visiting our camp last night. How could falsify this? True, Holly. Nobody ever put Bigfoot footprints . He's right, Holly. It's okay to have fun , but look around you . It is the worst place in the world to scare someone. Do not know what they are talking about. We need to say that we all to limit this morning. Holly! You hear that? We are investigating where came the strange sounds. We hear the recording but anyone know what might be ... ... and then find this, as the traces of the camp, without beginning or end. We're a little scared. Holly! Come see this! More tracks! - What is that? - A meteorological tower . They put them in remote areas like this. The propeller above the wind speed measured . It does not work , right? - Hey , what are you doing? - Look at the footprints . Whatever you made that noise , is here, and want to know why . - So? - Wait . What the fuck ... ? ! Are you okay? - Yes - Are you sure ? Holly ... Is one language ? -This is not safe , Holly ! - Yes , it seemed that. This is serious ! It is a language ! We should go now! - Denise , could you ... ? - And those prints ... ? - ... and what Jenson says ... ? Listen ! - It may be an animalGive us a minute ! Hey , come on. Bothering with that Teen Movie , come on. - Okay? - Yes Are you okay? Yeah I'm just a little scared , that's all . Well, you know . Everybody is . I heard about this mountain pass , in China, where birds collide with the walls and crazy people and animals , and die. And that's because the wind generates sound 4 mega Hertz that makes people go crazy . - Do not you think ... ? - The wind is driving us crazy ... ? No. Jenson , all saw the recording and we heard that , whatever it was . Please tell me what's wrong . I've heard it before . Jesus , Jenson . I had a ... I had a very bad trip when I was in school . One acid . Ok , I've never done . The funny part is that it seems that all brain cells triggered simultaneously. For the first time in your life , things got a little strange . and ... I heard . and I were chasing and I was running ... and next thing I know , policemen were picking me , and was in the middle of the street screaming about demons. and ... now I'm here with you. - And here they are. - Ok , dear , when I was a kid ... ... had these dreams . About this place . It was just like , mountains , snow , everything. It is as if this magnet, drawing me to this. And out of here and had this door ... A door . And I do not open it but I have to. And on the other side there is only darkness. And this darkness absorbs me . And I fully awoke screaming ... and my parents told me I was having night terrors , and took me to a psychiatrist , I given pills and nothing worked. All right. Then I saw in the news about these scientists , and ... I knew. I said , that is , is the place you 've been dreaming of. So I know that we will have do what no one else has been . Let's find out what happened to those people. All right. we also should be here . Right. How crazy about that . Been spending a lot of time with me . You're supposed to be our Velma . - What is that? - Scooby Doo . - Does the dog ? - Yes No, no, Velma ... It is supposed to be the intelligent, short hair, glasses ... - I never saw that series. - Okay, whatever. Unless you want to chat more , should go. < / i > You definitely do not want to finish well . This mountain is really fantastic . Did I mention how much I hate these snowshoeing ? Anyone? Anyone? -Wait! - Come on, slackers . Wait! It's here! Here we are ! -Thank God ! - Are you sure? I saw the pictures hundreds of times , is here . This is where it happened. This is the Dyatlov Pass . 53 years ago , nine people camped at the same site , had dinner and went to sleep . Sometime between 9 and 11 pm , something that the Russian authorities defined as " an unknown force uncontrollable " caused all your fleeing tent in such a panic , that tore from inside and plunged into the darkness , to 17 ? C below zero. You'll love this shot, Andy . You look like a television chef . Yes? Which one ? One gay . - It was hard. - Very nice, Jenson . Rustem Slobodin , 23, the first to fall . Igor Dyatlov , 23, leader and the most experienced all of them, probably was his idea try to get back to the tents . Kolmogorova Zinaida , 22, just a year older than what I am now , was the closest to the camp before I got the "strength " and was the only victim with signs of struggle. A body language lacked and much of the oral cavity. Dubinina Ludmila , 21 years . Nicolai Thibeaux - Brignolles . Alexander Zolotarev . Alexander Kolevatov . The cause of death of all the victims was listed as hypothermia, but Rustem and Nicolai also had serious skull fractures, and Ludmila and Alexander Zolotarev had several broken ribs . No body had defensive wounds no external wounds of any kind. Somehow, something might break Skulls of two men and break the ribs Ludmila and Alexander leaving nothing but bruises. Additionally, the body of Alexander had a high degree of radiation. Hello ! How, in a place like this , Alexander been exposed to much radiation ? Why only him? Krivonischenko georgiy 24 . Yuri Doroshenko , 21. While others fled , they sat still near the fire and quietly froze to death . - What is it, Andy ? - Nothing . There seems to be "nothing" . The GPS is wrong , should have been loaded when we got here . He went crazy . And you think that it is also my fault. - Do not know. Did you touch him ? -No! If so, also screwed with my watch. My altimeter is ruined. And look at this . Suunto is a compass . I am guided in the Himalayas , perfectly walked everywhere but here. I think we should go. - What? Just arrived ! - We have to go back yet but ... 're blind without a GPS or reliable map . - What 's wrong with the map? - We should not have come here yet. What do you mean ? According to the map , walked 23 kms today. Not possible we have come here before midnight . So what? We quickly. Look, let's pack up and travel until the compass stabilizes. Obviously , there is a kind of field magnetic rock or something. Let's start elsewhere. Nobody will notice the difference . - But it will not match what you recorded earlier. -Fuck what we recorded , Holly ! Obviously something is wrong, should go ! If we start to pack and , make it! No, no, no. I also do not want to stay, but by the time we gather around and get out , we will end up walking in the dark. Not good. Guys, it's only for one night . The people lived thousands of years without clocks and GPS . I think we will do it for one night. That's why we came. OK , let's have dinner . Thank you. Hey ! He's starting a relationship there, I feel I am more . I do not understand what she sees in this guy . - He's an asshole ... - Confident ... - ... full of himself ... - ... cocky ... - ... arrogant ... You know , there's room in that tent . Will not you join them ? Oh ! Maybe someday you too have a boyfriend as cute as Andy ... What are you doing ? Nothing, just ... Shit ! Thank you. This is one of the reasons why you can not find anybody . No, I can find someone, but now I'm dating you . In your dreams ... What Andy said on ... a magnetic field so ... Yes? And if not that ? OK Tell us what you have there . Well, this is a counter Geiger pretty basic. To put it simply , detects radiation levels. As you can hear ... definitely no radiation in this area . It could be uranium in the rock. Not dangerous , but more radiation than they should . And the source of it ... probably comes from there. We will verify . - It is in this direction. - Care . A Lucile not like this. I think we found something. Jenson . See how thin the ice is there? - Yes - Snow ... Yes? What is it? Looks like someone was here , perhaps in the last days . Be careful ! Ok . Here , above. -Holly, beware! - Ok . Wait . Jenson , do not think that's a rock. -Shit ! Are you filming this? - I'm shooting , I'm shooting . Be careful ! - See this? - Yes Go on, go on! Come on! - What is that? - Do not know. -Oh , God ! -Oh , Jenson ! You see this? Tellthe camera what you see! What do you see ? Come on! A cave or something ... God , Jenson ... leave the camera and come help me -There is a door ! - What? Leave the camera. We have to film this. This is so weird ! Sure it's weird, Jenson . Watch ! It is a door in the middle of the mountains! Is closed from the outside. It is designed to keep something inside. - Yes , but what? -Holly! Listen ... Come on! The Russian government has invested much time and effort to build a large, solid door on the mountainside to keep in what is there , we should ... Jenson ! What the hell are we here? Do not you want to know if the " uncontrollable force unknown "is the Yeti , or aliens , or ... one built by the Soviets Superman ? I want to know what happens here and the answer is behind that door ! Could you help me to open it , please? OK? Wait . - It's moving ... - Now open , but is stuck on the ice . Well, that means that can melt the ice ... - Well , let's call the other , water 's heat ... - No, no, no. Jesus. - No, because ... - Why? They're quite nervous , and this is going to go crazy , and ... ... and I do not want to move the camp , Do you understand ? So ... cont?mosles morning . Now let this, and back later, okay? Hello , friends ! What happens ? - Are we going to bed? - Sure . Good night. - Good night , Holly . - Good evening . Good night , boys. What are you reading ? " Slaughterhouse 5" . - Do not like Vonnegut ? - I love that book. - I was just thinking about him yesterday -Great! Very impressive ! - Sit back, Professor . - Thank you. Let's put this here ... You know , it is impossible to warm when you're sitting on snow all the time. I think my ass is numb since we left Vizhaj . - Find anything with the Geiger counter ? - No, it's perfectly safe . Good! I mean , I think they expected find something to your movie. There is still time . Young Love . Do not be so sure ... Thatcher is a good guy , but not think I have paste boyfriend. Do not ? I think it 's looking good. He talks like a teacher the " affair hiker " . Does " hiker affair "? Yes , let's see ... It takes a girl to the middle of nowhere especially when it is cold and needs someone to cuddle ... How romantic , my God! - And that's not the worst ... - Do you have herpes ? No, not to my knowledge . Did you see the camera of your phone? Oh , no! Is it recorded ? Not just to shoot landscapes, but has a camera on the bedpost . No! Denise ! Is lost ... And what is your tactic on excursions ? This is my friend ... Whisky Colonel . - Hello , Colonel. - Yes, please . John Patrick Hauser , Are you trying to get me drunk? It's the easiest way to get " paradoxical nudity " . Mmm . It's good. - Can you believe that? - Do not worry, is just a " hiker affair " . - What is an " affair hiker "? - You're still in the race ... Not sure I want discards of that subject . You can always call Lucile , right? You laugh , but ... Oregon legal if married with a camera, then ... I would.

They will try to kill us bury to look like an accident! Crazyshit! As if there were avalanches in the real world ! Are you saying you did not see those explosions ? Huh? Or was it a ghost of a mountain explorer ? -Do not know what happened ! - What? What? Any notices , look around you ! I had to request authorizations, and sent travel plans . JP , they knew exactly where and when we arrive . They waited until we fell asleep , Jenson is right, Someone is trying to kill us! - Jesus, Holly. Do you? -Oh , God ! OK . So tell me, who are they? The military ! -This is serious ... ! -You can not prove anything ... ! Shut up! Shut up! OK? I can not believe Denise is dead , but it is , OK? Now we have to calm and focus not to lose anyone else , OK? - Andy , what do we do ? - My backpack, first aid kit . OK . Now what do we do? They have to immobilize my legs OK .

I paid for the international plan . This is stupid . We need help. We light a flare. - If we did this sees the flare ... -No one ... did this! I do not know , JP . Maybe Jenson is right. No! So Andy risked his life to take his backpack. It's dark and if there is someone there, they have to do . Do you have to shoot ? No matter how this ends , I want to make records of what happened to us , well not done as another mystery of Dyatlov . If we are to do , Can not we find shelter before? Not think we can move to Andy . What was that ? - What? - That look ... What the hell is going on? We found something before with the Geiger counter . What did you find ? A door . What? We were freezing our fucking in snow all day,and is there a fucking bunker here ? ! But we could not open and radiation is ... strong . How strong ? Not dangerous, but ... Incredible ! Faked ? Traces ? No! No traces faked . Do not think so. Perfect , I think . OK . If someone triggered this avalanche , is right in there , right? Yes. Let's throw the flares , we bring someone , and whoever did this will not kill us. OK . Come on! What? Orange lights in the sky . JP , I'm sorry . I should have told , but you were so concerned with the compass , and ... and map, and ... did not want anything for this to happen. Yes .. You followed step by step how killed nine people , What did you think would happen ? I do not know . I just ... I always felt attracted to this place , do not know why , I can not explain . I did not want this. Do you think anyone saw the flare ? I do not know . I will not be sitting here a long time . I will open that door , there is radiation or not , OK? Yes. OK . You want blueberry pancakes or macaroni and cheese ? Have breakfast blueberry pancakes . Eat . Jenson ... - What is it ? - Friend ... I'm sorry about Denise , Really. You can think what you want , but sorry . Yeah, me too . Oh , shit ! Someone comes . Look! Help! We need help ! We sawflares ! Are they okay? Our friend is hurt ! - No, look . He's lying - What?

God ! OK , I turned it on . Oh , God ! What do you see ? It's a tunnel ! - What? - We are in a tunnel. OK . What do you see ? A switch ... a power switch . -Turn it on ! - OK . - Works . - Thank God ! - We lock the door - Why? Because if you work outside, can go at any time . Nobody is going to come in here , man . Not going to waste bullets. - Damn, Jenson ... - Did you see where we are? No one will come to save us. We are alone . They know that in a few days 'll be dehydrated ... and not have to worry Then I just close the door and return in a week . Unless we find a way out. - Can you walk? - Yes - OK . - Beware , beware. Shit ! OK . - Come right . - OK . - Jenson , stay close. - OK . Slow down , slow down. OK , wait a minute. Shit, shit ! Another tunnel, a tunnel. JP , JP ... What? What! What happened? I felt something . What? There is something here ! - Follow me. -There is something here , Jenson , I swear! There's nobody here , Holly . Come on! Shit ! - Which way? - Left . - Go slow. Slowly, slowly . - Well . The lights are on here . - Stay close . - OK . Shit . - Do not get ahead much . - No. Jesus! What is this place? It is a ... laboratory , I think. Or was . What happened here ? Who knows ? Sit down, let me see , let me see . Wait ... Toma. Use this. This will hurt. I'm sorry . Will serve for a few minutes . I found an opening . - Be careful. - Yes , no problem . Look at this place . Holly , come here. Look at this. - What is that? - A blog , I think. Know word - Yes ? - Yes .. I saw it many times while doing my research . What does it mean ? Killed in action . Of course. Can you understand more ? Only dates. 1945. 1959. The year that killed explorers. And then terminated . What? It's a boat. Is Eldridge , Is the USS Eldridge , the Philadelphia Experiment . What Philadelphia Experiment ? Come on! Do you live under a rock ? In 1943 , U.S. government conducted an experiment with that vessel. What kind of experiment? Teleportation . Oh , my God! There were rumors that there were people that was fused with the boat , but no one has ever seen anything like this. These photos should be ultra , ultra secret . They could kill someone for this. Oh , God ! OK . We gotta get out of here . - Yes - JP , can you move ? - No. - Shit . I will not leave here , you know? Think of something . Find a way out. OK , when found , will and drag you out myself . Come on! Jesus Christ! A cavern is formed naturally ... I do not think that has an exit . Perhaps the widened a little, that's all. Now you're a caver ? Watch this It looks like a nuclear power cell . So no electricity here . Alexander was here. Here you taking radiation. There must be a way out. Watch out! Oh , God ! What is that ? - It still works . - Give it to me . I told someone had been here recently. Who is ? A military . Why are you here ? If you are thinking of killing five Americans to keep a secret buried for 50 years, send someone to ensure there is still a secret to keep. - What are you doing ? - Checking something. Shit ! What we found in the meteorological tower ... Was your tongue? How did it get there? They must have left something out . So the door was lock. Could they have been experimenting with it , perhaps? Said that was common. My God ! Holly, look at the bullet holes . This was not a laboratory was an execution chamber . Oh , God ! Holly , what 's that? It seems one of the soldiers of that book . I do not understand . -Jenson ! - These things , no ... do not look normal . Maybe that's what he left out . What the hell was that? Wait! That door was not open. Do not ? Be careful ! What was that ? JP ? ? God ! There is something here , Jenson . -Oh , no! -My God ! - Is that blood ? - We gotta get out of here . - What is that? - Do not know. - A kind of light ? - No, what is below . Let me see . It is this same camera , and has battery. See what has . -No recordings ! -I want you to tell the camera! < / I > -must leave now , please! - The Cold War ended , we're friends now . < / I > - I do not ... - Adel?ntala before the battery runs out . died . < / i > To ! See what has . < / i > -No recordings ! -I want you to tell the camera ... Shit ! This is impossible ! No, maybe not ... Remember the Eldridge , the Philadelphia Experiment ? Were supposed to teleport Philadelphia to Norfolk. - So? - So ... Norfolk should reach 10 minutes before leaving Philadelphia. You mean you made ??a damn time machine? No. I'm saying that no one , not even our best scientists , neither the government , none knew what was happening , they did not know what they got . Holly, all these experiments were abandoned. The crew of the Eldridge , who did not finish fused with a bulkhead , went crazy . Some of them underwent changes ... mutations ... There was supposed to be do these things . JP ! Jenson , come on! Come on! JP ! Jenson ! Jenson ! What are you doing ? Come here ! - Where'd they go? - Came back for me. Do not have . Calm down now. -JP ! -Come on ! They're on the roof! On the roof ! Jenson ! -Jesus Christ! -Jenson ! - Where are they? -I do not know ! Look, they're up there! - Jenson , where does it go? -I do not know ! - Where did he go? -Go with JP ! Jenson ! We have to get him out of the door! When you do, run! Understand ! Understood ! -Run! - Beware! -Go, go ! -Over here ! -Come on! Run! Go ! Jenson , over here! Poe ? Let us run? Why did they stop? I do not know . We should be dead. Why not kill us when they could ? What the hell is that? It's like a giant fossil . - What are you doing ? - Waiting for us . -JP ! I said I would for him ... - You can not , you saw what they did . If we open that door , we will do the same . We are stuck , and they know it. We are here because they want it . - Holly , did you see that ? - Yes Do it again . - You shot it , right? - Yes Right. I knew, I knew ... - What? - Teleportation . These creatures , how disappeared ... turned ... intangibles. You can teleport . But not through these doors. So are locked on the outside . There must be a connection between those things and this place . They come from here , came across this. It makes sense ... It's like ... a giant ... " wormhole " . Like a ... teleporter . - How did you come here ? - Do not know. Holly, Mansi , natives , have been here for thousands of years. I do not know how this thing but These drawings are surely them. So they built a teleporter ? I do not know , maybe. Perhaps they found it in a cave and did these drawings . It may be some kind of alien technology , maybe they were making a weapon. What if there were more sites like this around the world? If those things came out of there, that would explain a lot unsolved mysteries : Eldridge , the appearances of Mothman in Point Pleasant ... Who knows what else ? - No more flashlight battery . -Shit ! -Jenson , I see nothing ! - Okay . Take my hand . Right. Watch where you step. Very well . We are facing the door. Stretch your hands and sit down, there it is. OK . Right. It happened ... What? I opened the door and darkness followed me , like in my dream . Hey , come on. Hey , hey, hey . - It was a dream , just a dream ... - Forgive . Jenson ,never get out of here! Forgive me ... Is the camera on? - I see the light. - Yes Good . I have an idea. Nothing Ta- you - you again, Jenson . Battery is spent . No. The portal ... And what about " wormholes and time-space continuum ... " " ... and the total destruction of our tiny human brains "? That is my plan. Look ... You have no control , has no buttons, what it means to be a fixed location, or anywhere. What Anywhere? That's all I can think of . But what if ... ... you imagine a place ... ... clearly in your mind , and focus , and you there ? You can only think that there is no place like home. Simple as that. Simple as that. Did not finish fused with the mountains? I do not know . I hope not. We will die here , Jenson . Is this ... or them. OK . What do we do ? Just a guess , but there must be a place fresh in your memory , Somewhere nearby , a place you can remember in detail. The exterior of the mountain. ? The other side of the door? It is one of the most fresh in my mind , and now that the door is closed , protect us from those things , right? OK . OK . I have fear. "All is well , and everyone should do what you are doing . " Where is that? " Slaughterhouse 5" . Never read it . Do not let go . Other bodies. Vallik ! But I found all the tourists ! Who are these ? -Stay away ! -You heard ! Get away ! -Wait ! -We did nothing ! - Just want to help ... - Okay . The Army said here quarantine to discover what happened. Return to the city to the other , please . -Get out ! - OK . What are they doing ? How to find out what happened if you are taking it? -Come on, Alya ! - Hear ... He knows what is best for you The situation now is under military control . I do not even know who they are ! Rest . To the left. Rest . - What are you doing ? - We put them with the others. No, no. Dr. Miktenko all want to see . - Post them apart. - Why? They are equal to each other. Come, come ! Look at those clothes. I never saw anything like that in my life. Save them . Quick, quick ! Very well . Hang them on the hooks ! - Who are they ? - Perhaps Dyatlov group . - They made a mistake in coming here . - It does not matter , Let's get out of here . I hate this place . It gives me chills . In 2013 , the main scientists worldwide are still unable to explain what Dyatlov happened to the original group . But some believe that the answers are there, buried under the snow and rock, waiting to be found ...
