foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Hi, Birte! - Where are you going? - We're going to a wedding! Whose wedding? Little Per's sister is getting married! Well, here they come. (buzz) (plays the wedding march) Are you really smart, man? Spit it out. Shame there's a reason I've remained a bachelor. Now it doesn't go any further either. Yes, I'm not going to make a long speech. But it is a solemn moment when a father says goodbye to his big girl. I wish your mother could have experienced this, - - but it was not to be. Peter, I'm glad it was you who became my son-in-law. Yes, we are. I also liked the bricklayer who lived here. The red head. - There was nothing between him and Sis. - Really? So, so, child. You deserved a bigger wedding party, - - but since you'd rather travel, - - others think it's cozy, we're only ourselves. - Dear child, good luck. - Thanks, little daddy. Thanks. Jensen, here's a little bite for you. (Peter hits the glass) It is usually customary to thank for the bride. It won't be particularly difficult for me, because Sis is the sweetest girl in the world. And I promise you, father-in-law, I'll take good care of her. Thank you, Peter. Long live the bride and groom! They live! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Cheers! It is as you saw yourself twenty years ago. Should we say thirty, huh? Nah, hear now. Do I look that old? They are stored, Mrs Sejersen. Aged like most noble wines. Well... - Have you heard anything from uncle Sofus? - Yes, he has presented the young people a car. - It is parked outside. - A car? Dear sweet both of you, - - who today have settled in love and hope and faith. May happiness smile at your home, so perhaps as time rushes forward, - - become mother and father of four yourselves. - Maybe five. - That I must say. What a blessing that the young people could not get an apartment. Yes. Yes. Because then they can stay here in the house, - - so we can keep an eye on them. We'll probably have to get the twig in good condition until you come back. And let's all raise our glass together - - and wish the bride and groom a good journey. Cheers, guys. - Thank you, Uncle Anders. - You are welcome. Sis, Peter has brought the suitcases out into the wagon. Thanks, that's good, Ole. - Goodbye father, and thank you for everything. - Goodbye, little Sis. Then it's probably my turn. I also need a little hug. - Did you get it tied to the wagon? - Yes, in the back. - Did he discover it? - No. Goodbye, little Mie. Now take good care of the house, father and the boys. Yes, Sis, I will. We will follow you out! No, wait a minute! The rice grains! Nice trip! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Then we get up. - What time is it? - Six thirty. Good night. Nah! - Oh, you can't be familiar with that. - You can't either. You and Per promised to help with the house before we go to school. - Is Per up then? - No, but he will now. Up with you, Per. Don't you hear? Is that you, Jensen? Up with you. - Oh there you are! Get up! - No, I will not! No, no! No, no, I won't! No, no, leave it! No, let it be! I will not! Do not! - Wash yourself properly. - Yes, little Mie. - Ole, are you sleeping? - Yes. I thought so. (the doorbell rings) - Good morning. - It's usually Miss Sis. - Mrs. Sis. She got married yesterday. - Yes, it's true. Now I'm in charge of the household, so you have to come exactly with the bread. Whoa, take it easy, little housewife. (the kettle howls) Ih, you gosh! Uh! Yes, I thought so. You cannot be trusted. Per, you forgot to turn off the water. The whole house is flooded. (snoring) No, now that is enough. Oops? You too, Jensen? This is the last time I call on you two. - Huw she rushes with us. - Yes, she's really tough. - Poor man getting married to her. - Yes. Per, are you coming? Here you go, little Mie. They look a bit flat, those snacks. Sis usually gives us extra on the day after a party. Then you'll get a piece of steak, but the rest must be used for snack food. Take that tray and start setting the table. Are you almost done? Nice, huh? Sis used to always shine my shoes. You are also very accostumed. But it needs to be fixed. (the porcelain smashes) Oh, no! - Do we have more morning cups? - Did you smash them all? No, only three. I bumped into Jensen, and he is unspeakably upset. Will you then take the broom and remove the cuttings immediately. (the doorbell rings) - Aah, what is it? - Now I have to. Good morning, little Ole. Good morning, Mrs Sejersen. Always early. I just wanted to ask if I could help with anything. It's really nice of you, but the children manage it magnificently. - Won't you have a cup of tea with us? - Yes, thank you very much, I would like to. - Here you go. - Thank you. I totally forgot to say thank you for last night. It was an adorable party. Yes, it was nice. And the children were happy. Yes, it was the least I could. - Mrs Sejersen has arrived. - We know that well. - Running from the morning... - Per, take the bread. Come on. - Good morning, Mrs. Sejersen. - Good morning. - Shall we have the nice sunday cups? - It's Per's idea. - Listen, what have you done to your finger? - That is nothing. - She's cut herself. - That's 'cut herself.' - Shall I pour the tea? - Yes, thank you, Mrs. Sejersen. It looks a bit thin. It may need to dry a little. I think it would be an idea to put tea leaves on it. - Did you forget the tea leaves? - Yes, darn it. After all, I think a mature woman's hand is missing here. Ole and Per are otherwise so good at helping and being useful. Dad, if I had to become a Boy Scout, I could learn to be more useful. - Scout? Has there been any talk of it? - Yes, Per has talked a lot about it. Brilliant idea. It is a healthy and wonderful life. I have been a scout myself. - Have you, Mrs. Sejersen? - Yes, it was a lovely time. tjing tjang guli guli guli guli guli vasa tjing tjang uri uri va tjing tjang guli guli guli guli guli vasa tjing tjang uri uri va ela ela well va ela tja va o kaliba ela ela well va ela tja va o kaliba damn damn damn ui Thank you, Mrs. Sejersen, it was excellent. Then I give up. - Are you really going to, dad? - Yes, my boy, since you like. Hello, Grethe! Hi per. - Have you got a Negro doll? - Yes, by my father. - Weren't you on holiday in Norway? - No, we came back yesterday. - See Jensen. - He is completely crazy with that dog. - What is it called? - Have no idea. We call it Olsen. - Per, you don't have time. - Come on, you party original. Yes, yes, here I am. - Relax, we have plenty of time. - Well, we haven't. Better five minutes early than five minutes late. - What homevwork do you have to today? - History and arithmetic. - In the first lesson we will have geography. - I haven't opened a book. - As long as I don't get up. - You probably do. Do you want to go home with you? Are you there again, Jensen? I said I don't want you here at school. Nah, that can't help. Go home with you. Come on. Yes, yes, you little bandit, I have remembered. And they call me an educator. Today we are going to hear all about South America. Let's see. Who should we start with? Let me see... Henrik. Nah, by the way, Ole. Let us hear what you can do. So what is this area called? - I think it's Columbia. - No. Let me quote my old uncle: "One must never believe, think, presume, assume or think. You have to know." Then it's Argentina. - And you are absolutely sure of that? - Yes, yes... It certainly sounds interesting. Then it must have moved since yesterday. Not a word has been read about it. What is the correct answer, Henrik? - French Guinea. - Right. You haven't read your homework, my gentleman. Sit down. He can't go for it, Mr. Hansen. We got married yesterday. I mean, we had a wedding yesterday. Our older sister got married. - Then I must congratulate you. - Thank you. I don't have any siblings who are going to get married in the near future, do you? Nah, we only have Per. It calms me. Then it will probably last a few years. (The children laughs) Now you have to be nice, Per, otherwise I'll lose my patience. Go on, Birte. "And King Skalk came as a little baby sailing to Denmark - - all alone on a ship. There was no sailors on board." Then it must have been remote-controlled. (The children laughs) Per, now I'm sorry for your interruptions. Come up here. Just sit down, Birte. It was excellent. When you are so eager to talk, - - can you tell us about another Danish legendary hero, namely Holger Danish. He is the one who sits on Kronborg and sleeps with his beard in the drawer. (The children laughs) Holger Danish is sitting in the casemats, and the beard has grown into the table. He is sleeping. What time does he wake up? Can you tell me that? No, but I know another good one. Do you know why the little peepers are so happy in the morning? That's because they don't have to come out of the feathers. (The children laughs) May I ask for peace. And do you want to go out into the hallway. I'm writing a note so your father can see how naughty you are. - That was not my intention... - Shut up. And disappear. (The children laughs) Ouch... Just come down. I know you're hanging in there. - Are you now put outside the door again? - Yes, and you don't learn much from that. - What have you done? - Nothing. So don't do it another time. Headmaster, I have been allowed to become a scout. Then you have to change your behaviour. A scout is cheerful, but not sassy. And he does a good deed every day. - And I'm looking forward to it. - It's good, my friend. I am an old scout myself. That was in 1908. Great time, great time. And remember it with the good deeds. Headmaster, couldn't you think of doing a good deed today? What do you mean? - Yes, talking to the Horned Owl. - With whom? Miss Ludvigsen. She has given me a note. And when father sees it, I may not be allowed to become a wolf cub. - Yes, it's crazy. - I would like to promise something in return. Let's hear the bid. I will be nice for the rest of the year. - Can you hold it? - At least I can try. Good. Miss Ludvigsen, just a moment. - The headmaster wants to talk to me? - Yes. I know that Little Per has deserved that remark. I talked hard words to him, and he has promised penance and recovery. Don't you think that little affair can be settled with an apology? - Yes, as the principal thinks. - Excellent, excellent. Then you escaped for this time. You can go back in. Thank you very much and for forgiveness. I'll shut up everyone who calls you a horned owl. Horned owl? As you know, today we have to take in a new wolf cub. Come into the circle, Per. What does the wolf law say? "A wolf howls the old wolf, and a wolf never gives up." - Do you want to take the wolf oath? - Yes, I will. I promise to do my best to keep the wolf law - - and every day do a small thing that can make someone happy or help someone else. I trust you to keep your promise. Be so good, here is your badge of the cross. Now you are accepted into the great brotherhood of scouts. And then your name is not Per, but Panther. Should we give Panther a real howl of welcome? Happy hunting, wolves! Akila, we will do our best! - Will l geb geb geb? - We want gob gob gob. (horn rattle) What a shock you gave me. You must never do that again. Help me get those potatoes up. See here where they lie and flow everywhere. You must apologize for that, but I am so happy today. - Yes, you are in uniform. - I have to play in the orchestra. And next week we are going to camp and sleep in sleeping bags. It sounds really good. Well, good luck then. (horn fanfare) Ole, Mie, come and see Per. Congratulations, Per! When I wear this uniform, my name is not Per, but Panther. - Yes, I must remember that. - Thanks. - What can I do for you today? - What can you do for me? - I really don't know. - Now go and find something. - The grass needs to be mowed. - It's fine. A wolf obeys the old wolf. I go to war with the lawn. What happens to him? He must do a good deed every day. We must make use of that. There's the mail! Is there mail for us? Dad! - It's from Sis. It's from Paris. - Let's see what it says! "Dear everyone. We are having a great time. I'm at a restaurant eating frogs." - Whoa! - I'm happy it is not me. I wanted to try that. Shame on you, Per! It is a shame to eat such a small frog. What about the cows, pigs and chickens? We eat them. - That is also something else. - "In the morning we continue south." "Kind regards to father, Ole, Mie, Per and Jensen." - Where is Jensen? - Over at Olsen's. - How do you know that? - That's what Grethe said. - She has invited us to tonight. - We must bring instruments. - Then I can try my new horn. - We will have an evening with rawr in. - What do her parents say about that? - Nothing. They are not at home. - It's going to be crazy. - Yes, yes, yes... all the children trolls a cheerful tune here is the rhythm that we can enjoy today a wash-ready skiff on the washboard put cotton wool in the ear well so that it is covered because now you gets from A and to Z a wash-ready skiff on the washboard everyone is happy with our little laundry even if we make noise, they find themselves a wash-ready skiff on the washboard my father he's taking a headache tablet and says play so until you run tired a wash-ready skiff on the washboard anyone who sings can sing if they want to those who are lazy can clap to the beat a wash-ready skiff on the washboard stomp the beat firmly on the floor's shiny parquet so the bulb cracks in every lamp for washing slate on the washing board everyone in the house has learned the funny song they are then happy that we play time and time again a wash-ready skiff on the washboard the canary cheerfully sings the duet with the pussy Cat dancing ballet for washing slate on the washing board the whole family will be spoiled by our game aunts and uncles want to dance to a wash-ready skiff on the washboard my aunt jumps around with funny jokes so the stiffener jumps in her corset for washing slate on the washing board all the children now like rampage the most we want tones with real tju and bang a wash-ready skiff on the washboard if Mozart had lived he would have cried he had gotten a plug outright of washed slate on the washing tray (horn rattle) All men to the pumps! Give me some water. So, so, don't splash. Can you then get finished. We'll eat in five minutes. Is there more in the pot? - Why don't you eat your food? - Don't like oatmeal. Aah, nonsense, man. Sprinkle well with sugar. Take a good mouthful and then close your eyes. Then it's not so bad. There you can see for yourself. If you just keep at it, you will become a big, strong man. Listen up. When we have finished eating and washing up, - - then some must go out and collect fireworks, - - and we're going to get eggs down at the big farm. Who will help? (whistles satisfied) (thunderclap) (children's cry) - What is it? Why are you hooting? - It's Klaus. - The horse? What's wrong with it? - It must be sold. Grandfather has been ill this winter. That is why we have no money. What can you get for such a one? A man will give DKK 300 for it, but I don't want to get rid of Klaus. - How long have you had it? - Always. I can't do without it. - When will they come and pick it up? - On Monday. Today is Wednesday. Then there is plenty of time. We must find something. - What do you want to do? - I do not know. But the world is full of good ideas, my dad says. It's just a matter of finding them. - Do you think you can help me? - A wolf never gives up. Now it seems to have stopped raining. Yes, the sun is shining. Listen up. First I have to go to the farm and get eggs, - - and then I have to talk to my friends about it. You will hear from me. Now we have called a meeting here on the council cliff. We have to find a way to help the little girl. - Does anyone have a suggestion? - Yes, I get an idea. - Couldn't we put on a show? - I can do wheelbarrels. Everyone can do that. Do you think anyone will pay DKK 300 to see it? We could have a summer party. After all, we have our orchestra. - Kit bakes apple slices, 3 for 25 cents. - And sack runs and things like that. And on Sunday our parents come. They must pay DKK 10 for entrance. DKK 10? Have you got sunstroke? Shouldn't we say one kroner for adults and 50 cents for children? Yes, and those who have no money must come in anyway. We probably can't manage all that alone, but there is a scout camp closer to this. - Maybe they will help us. - Lend us tents and things like that. They have visits from some real Scots. Maybe they will perform for us? It will be a great party. We also get hold of the rural ones. Then we agree. Then we close the meeting on the council rock. (heches scissors that cut) Mrs Sejersen! Yes, here I am. Listen up. I have received a letter from Per. Do you want to go to the Wolf Camp on Sunday? I really want that. I found my old scout hat. - Do you think Per wants me with him? - Yes, now you just have to listen. "You must make me happy to take Uncle Anders and Mrs. Sejersen with you." How sweet it was of him. He is now a lonely little guy. Yes, he is, yes. - Oh, do you have to pay? - Yes, it goes to a good cause. Then it must be my turn. Three adults and three children. - Four and a half crowns. - It just makes sense. Then maybe you can tell me where we can find Per. I don't know anyone Per. - He's a wolf cub. - His name is Panther. You cannot avoid finding him. He wonders around everywhere. - Three adults. - DKK 3 Look, there's a sack race, and there's Per. - In the middle sack. - Yes, indeed he is too. (the scouts cheer) - See the small party original. - As long as he didn't beat himself up. Up again, Per, up again! (the family cheers Per) That was good, Per! - Hi, Per. You did great. - Not so crazy at all, little man. - Hey everybody. - Good morning, Per. - We have taken little Grethe with us. - It was good. Hi Grethe and welcome. You have also brought money with me? Otherwise, the little pony will be sold. Hello, hello! Now something happens again. We need six healthy dads for a tug-of-war against six healthy scouts. - We have to go and see. - And you're reporting, aren't you, father? - No way. - You are so nice and fat. So, so. Your father is a bit strong. - Yes, it takes effort. - What, dad? Don't talk about. No. Come on, who's signing up? - There are five fathers. There is one missing. - Now he's coming! - No, no, no... - Yes! Now comes my father! It was a rough game. - You saved the honor then. - You were gorgeous. - Well done, old man. - They must be very strong. Well, I don't know that soon. - Now I have to run. - Is there anything we can help with? I can go and look at the Scots, they start now. And Grethe, the two of us can sing our Negro song. And you can sell apple slices. And you must be a horse's hind leg. - Good day. The police have free access. - That's not why I'm coming. I would ask you to look for a couple of guys at a 15-16 year old. They have run away from home up here and should have been seen in the vicinity. One is dark-haired, the other heavily freckled. They are a pair of mean troublemakers. - We'll probably have to keep an eye out. - It is fine. Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen. Now our famous circus begins - - with outstanding artists and trained animals. The world's only circus with 24 wild wolf cubs. uhajo inkanato anduha baki (gunshot) And now comes the horse Columbus! Columbus is good at counting. Can you count to three? Good. So, so, so. Now Columbus wants to do a little dance for us. Where did the horse go? Can you come in here then! So come here. Music! Can you come up, Columbus! in the African jungle there you find mystery the animals like to dance swing lions and giraffes and the monkey children and mosquitoes dance around in time a black little negro from Africa umpapa umpapa with ten crocodiles as audience umpa umpa umpa um in Africa are animals that I love and understand the glasses snake is my best friend and the spectacle snake's tail punctured yesterday who had to patch it a black little negro from Africa umpapa umpapa i patched it with gum umpa umpa umpa um Africa is fun you can believe there is fun I brush the rhinoceros' nose and when the leopard gets stains on his clothes then I will be called a black little negro from Africa umpapa umpapa then I wash it with a little soap suds umpa umpa umpa um Here you go, 25 cents. Also three for me. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Lovely warm apple slices. - No thanks. Whoa, what was that? Such a naughty guy. - Ouch, you. Here is a purse. - Is there anything in it? - Yes, plenty. - Give it to me. - What is it made of? What are you doing here? - What does it matter to you? - You are apparently out to steal. - Mind your own business. Help, stop the thieves! Stop! - It was close, what? - The little idiot. - Look, there is a house. - Yes, that also happens. Wait here. Come on, no one lives here. I'll take a stone. You, there's a lid in the floor. You, Black. Come and see. - There are lots of beers here. - A whole box. - It's beautiful. - Here we stay. - Isn't it too close at the camp? - No, nobody thinks we're that crazy. - What kind of party did they have? - They collected for something or other. - As long as there is now DKK 300. - Don't worry, there are over 500. 587 crowns and fifty ears. You have done a good job. And now everyone is going to sleepyland. And tomorrow morning before we leave, - - we all go there together and hand over the money to the little girl. Let me watch you rush into the bags, then I'll come up and say goodnight. Come on guys, we're going to bed! - You must now have thanks for the help. - You are welcome. They are some fresh little guys. - Uh, I have toiled at it. - It's just as bad for the rest of us. It would have been easier to win the money in "Quit or Double." - In the television? - Ha! - What do you say "ha" to? - You can't go up in that program. There was a boy who grew up in orchids. I guess I can too. - In what? - All about candy, for example. You just laugh. Do you perhaps know where the cacao bean grows? - Nah. - I know. It grows on the Gold Coast and in Brazil. Aev baev, you didn't know that. Brag about you, you don't dare go in there. As soon as we get home, I'll go and sign up for it. Now I've heard it, everyone. He can't run from it. And if you win, I'll cross the town hall square in my bare shirt - - and plays "High from the green top of the tree." It is in order. Mie, there's a card from Sis. Now they have come to Italy. No, they are photographed in front of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. - What shall we have for dinner? - Minced beef. - What should we have afterwards? - I've bought a nigger kiss for each. Bravo bravissimo, smart idea. Don't feed Jensen so much. It has become thick. So what? It has a good appetite. Have you picked up those books for uncle Anders? - Is he here again today? - He is sitting upstairs at Per's. "Vanilla and other flavorings." "Cultivation of sugar beets." "Chocolate und Confectionery." But what is he going to use it for? - Per has signed up for the quiz. - What? Per has signed up for "Quit or Double." - And they accepted him. - Aah, hold on. He can't do that. That is why Uncle Anders reads with him. Do you have those books with you? Here they are. Per is so terribly insecure about nougat. In nougat. So it is true. Per never makes it. He must. It is a matter of honor. - When should it be? - On Sunday. I am so I tremble. Good evening, we have "Quit or Double" again. And the first participant tonight is probably the youngest participant of the season. Per has chosen the topic "All about sweets." We must have the referee on the stand. There is confectionery manufacturer Joergensen. Good evening, Mr. Joergensen. Go ahead and sit down. And then we will say hello to Per, who will appear in "All about sweets." Good evening, Per, and welcome to "Quit or Double." - I didn't know you were so small. - Shouldn't one be? Yes, you should. But I think we should lower the mic a little bit. - Well, Per, do you buy a lot of sweets? - No, we can't afford, says father. - Are there perhaps many children at home? - Yes, but the others are old. Listen the little party original. Now we get laughed at school. Here comes the first question. Let's reveal what it is you have to answer. - I hope you are well tonight. - I am. The first question gives DKK 156 and reads like this: "Can you name six different kinds of candy?" - Six? - Yes. Chocolate, caramels, candies and licorice... - It was four. - Marzipan and popsicles. That's right, it was six. DKK 156 is at home, Per. - Do you want one more question? - Yes, we'll grab another one. It goes like this: "What is chocolate?" - It's great. - Yes, you are right. - But what else can you tell? - It is a drug of pleasure. It consists of cocoa mass, sugar and sweetened milk powder. It has an invigorating effect, - - as it contains theobromine, the same as in tea. Theobromine? The judge nods, then it's right. So what's next? - You're not nervous, Per? - Nah. - So do you want one more question? - Yes. Then you get it. DKK 625 applies now. The question is about nougat. "How many kinds of nougat are there and how are they made?" - Shall I read the question again? - No thanks. But if you don't care, I'd rather you read the answer. There are three kinds. Hard, soft and French nougat. Hard nougat is burnt sugar with nuts. It is crushed and used on ice. Soft nougat is roasted hazelnuts, sweetened milk powder, sugar, - - cocoa butter and cocoa beans. French nougat, it's worse. Whipped sugar mass made from sugar - - and egg whites mixed with candied fruit and roasted nuts. - Phew, it was right above the city. - Then perhaps you would rather quit? - No, we're just hustling. - I see. The fourth question is for DKK 1,250. That's a lot of money. We'll take it. The question reads: "To what genus does the vanilla plant belong and where does it grow?" It belongs to the orchid family and grows in Mexico and Java. That was fast. It was something you could do. Congratulations on that. Then we would like to see you again in a fortnight. You can't mean that. Now I was just in the spark. Were you? Yes, what should we do? You weren't that long after all. - Shall we continue? - Yes! Thanks. Yes, Per, then we will open up one of the expensive questions. Are you aware of that? That's it for DKK 2,500. And it reads: "Is licorice made from ox blood or horse blood?" - No. - What are you saying no to? This is something people believe. Licorice comes from the plant kingdom. It is extracted from the licorice root, which grows in the Mediterranean. The juice is evaporated and dried into what we call English licorice. I see. But what else do you know about licorice? You must buy it from Mrs Mortensen, the MainStreet 25. Per, we must not advertise on television. It was just good advice. She always has fresh produce, - - and her body paint is connected, but she never sees that. Is the judge satisfied? Yes, but which raw material is found in licorice, caramel and candies? It is extracted from potato flour. Then we will have to start the clock. You will have half a minute from now. It is something that contains dextrose and water. Right, but what's it called? - Glucose! - Yes, that's right, Per. Sixth question is for 5000. - Do you want to take it? - Yes, if I can for father. Father nods. Then you can, if you want. I want to. Then we will have the sixth question, and then you will go into the thinking box. Have you regretted it, Per? You don't have a phone book or two I can sit on, do you? - Yes, we have. - Otherwise I can't see. It is also uncomfortable. There you go, Per. - Can you hear me, Per? - Okay, yes. Then the sixth question applies to DKK 5,000. It sounds like this: "How tall is the cocoa tree? How many seeds are in the fruit?" "How much fat does the cocoa bean contain and what is it called?" - Do you want to hear it one more time? - No, thank you, it's not necessary. The cocoa tree is approx. 10 meters high. Its fruit resembles an asia - - and contains from 25 to 50 seeds. Cocoa beans contain 50% cocoa butter, - - which is also used for pharmacy products and the ladies' lipstick. But then the cocoa flavor is taken away, and I think that's a bit silly. Well done, Per. I am impressed by you. Shall we take the last question? I'm doing well. It's worse with you, Mr. Petersen. They look so nervous. Do you think so? Do you want the seventh question? - Yes, I would like to. - To 10,000. Then go back in and put on headphones and we'll get the seventh question. It is here. We try. Per, 10,000 crowns. "What is the Latin name for the cacao bean?" "When did it become known in Europe? Where did it come from? Who introduced it?" The Latin name is Thebroma Cacao. Yes, and where did it come from? - From Mexico. - Who brought it here and when? It must have been the Spanish. Yes, in 1520 the Spaniards brought cocoa to Europe, - - and soon everyone was drinking chocolate at the princely courts. Yes, thank you, that's fine. Congratulations on that. You have passed the last quiz. In a castle near Paris lived a woman called Madame Pompadour. She was a good friend of Louis XV, so she had to be really loved. Yes I understand that. Thank you. She drank buckets of chocolate from tiny little cups. And Ludvig, who reigned from 1715 to 1774, also liked it. He just got so fat from it, - - but there are also 5000 calories in each kilo of chocolate. - That is also true, Per. - But I know much more. Look what's come to you. Chocolate, flowers and your prize. We all wish you the best of luck with your performance. Very nice. Well done! Well done! Well, is it just you? Here you have the smokes. And then you will see something very interesting. - Do you know that little guy over there? - He was the fool from the camp. - DKK 10,000 - There is no justice anymore. DKK 10,000. We could use that. It says he's going up here on Sunday. You should ask him to take the money with him. - If only you could come up with something. - Have you thought of abducting him? - Yes, why not? - You can't do that. It is then very easy. It's all in the book. "Kidnapped." I won't go along with that. Why not? Are you afraid? Nothing needs to happen to him. It is too dangerous. What about the police? That is exactly why. We have to raise money to get out of the country. We try with 5000. Just do as I say. It is rock solid. ul ul wolf pack forward in cheerful rhythm Wolf cubs be ready, we are all going hunting all healthy wolf cubs now sing along in chorus one two three whoop, one two three whoop all healthy wolf cubs know the familiar words one two three whoop, one two three whoop freely through the forest on wolf's feet everyone follows the law be very wise all healthy wolf cubs are on the right track one two three woof woof woof woof woof Yes, wolves, here we go again. You got your big wish fulfilled. A sunday trip out here to our lovely cabin. We have a whole long day to enjoy ourselves in, but first we have to collect fireworks. Who signs up? Who should we take? I think yellow gang. Come on, yellow gang! All you others come in here with me. Brake, you two goes that way. Rikki, you're going that way. Panther, stay with me. I go down to those trees. There appear to be some large branches. Panther! Panther! Per, where are you? - Haven't you seen Per? - He was with you. - Yes, but suddenly he disappeared. - Let's call. (howling like wolves) He can't disappear like that. Come, let's go home and tell. Are you there already, Deer? That was fast. - There's nothing wrong, is there? - Panther has disappeared. He suddenly disappeared into the forest. I thought he had gone back here. - How far did you go? - We were just at the edge of the forest. That was odd. Then we must go out and look for him. We went here. Per said he would go over to those trees there. Suddenly he was away. I called but he didn't answer. Then we try to go that way. Spread out, but make sure you can see each other. Panther! Panther! Panther! Panther! Now you can go that way, then we will go that way. Panther! Panther! Panther! What do we do? They come this way. Should we hide? No, I go out and talk to them. Start the gramophone. Sorry, but this is private land. We know, but we're looking for a little boy who got lost. Have you seen him? Nah... Yes, by the way. A little splicing with blonde hair? No, it's not him. He is dark-haired. Sorry. Aah, I beg. Panther! Panther! Panther! - Did they get suspicious? - No, we managed it well. If they now go to the police? His father doesn't care about the letter we sent him. And as long as we have the boy, they dare not do anything to us. "Lay DKK 5000 at the rune stone in Big Forest tonight before 8." "If you go to the police, you won't get to see Per anymore. X." - What is it, though? - Just someone making fun of us. - Think if it's true. - Nonsense. Many boys form gangs. Great Forest? It is in the vicinity of the camp. (the phone is ringing) Yes, hello? Yes, it is me. What do they say? Has Per disappeared? We have looked everywhere. I think we should call the police. - The police? - Dad, you mustn't do that. They must not do anything. We have received a very strange letter. I'll take a car and come right away. So it was right. - Call for a carriage! - We'll go with you. - Have you found him? - No. - It was Panther's father. - Now it's really crazy. What do you think is happening? Only we could help. - I thought it was all a joke. - Maybe it's an insane person. That's what you don't know. But the letter looked childish. - You must not take any risks. - No. I go downstairs and put the money. - But you don't have them at all. - I pretend to lay them. I have a plan. But it depends on whether you and the wolf pack will help me. - We will. - Thanks. - Do you have a map of the area? - Yes, over here. We run away and take Jensen with us. Maybe it can find the track. Go now. It is best to be in good time. - Why don't you go yourself? - They know me from the other day. So you expect me to be discovered? Then they have to get up early. No one can fool me. So long. That's good, children. Let me get him. Come here, my fine friend. Where is my son, Per? - Then answer me, boy! - You would like to know that. You will never find him. I can hardly hold it. - Look, there is a house. - It looks dark. - There's probably no one at home. - It looks mysterious. I think I release Jensen. Jensen, be a good dog and find Per. You must find Per. Jensen, come on. Look, now it's up at the door. Come on, we're going there. (they knock on the door) (there's a knock on the door) - What do you want? - Where is our little brother? How should I know? - Can you come out! - Look at Jensen! - There is a lid. - It can probably smell Per. Whoa, can you leave my sister alone. Per! Per! - What have they done to you? - It was good, you found me, little Mie. How we were afraid of you. Now I have to untie you. (uproar) - What is it? - Only Ole, who fights. Beat him up, beat him! (Jensen barks) Can you behave! I'll give you! I've got him, I've got him! Let him go, Per. Let me fix him. Inside with him! Phew! Well done, old boy! Dad! Dad! - We met the telegraph messenger on the road. - It's probably from Sis. So, so, so. Don't rush. Let's see what they write. Nah, now I never have! - What do you never have? - Familiar mate. They come home Saturday afternoon at three o'clock. - That's bravo. - Saturday? It is today! - Hurray. hurray! - It's cruel. The whole house floats. Their room is not ready. It has been painted and wallpapered. - But the curtains are not hung. - And the furniture must be in place. Hello Hello. What a nice weather. And how disturbed they look. - Glad you came, it's horribly mad. - Yes, you must help us. - What is going on here? - You can always find out. Mrs Sejersen! Mrs Sejersen! Yes, what is it? Can't you help us? Sis and Peter come home from their honeymoon and we're busy. Yes, gladly. When should I be there? They must come now. The whole house stands on the other end. (the clock strikes three) Can you see, children? We made it. - It's really cozy here. - I'll get the party committee. Now the bride and groom can come. It is strange to be so quiet. - They may not be at home at all. - No, it looks so closed. Let's just go inside. (the children play the bridal waltz) Welcome, dear children. - Good day, little daddy. - Hello, father-in-law. Good morning, Sis, and welcome home! Was it a nice honeymoon? - Yes, you can believe that. - Good morning, and welcome home. We are excited to hear what you have experienced. - And many thanks for the cards. - We have had a wonderful time. - Hello, Sis. - Good day, little darling. How I have missed you. And how good it was that nothing happened to you. Those were some bad guys. We have lots of gifts and surprises to take home. - We also have a surprise for you. - And you'll never guess. - It sounds mysterious. - Now I just have to see. --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
