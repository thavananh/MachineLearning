foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- All right... Whoo! Mel! There she is, Ms. Rosie Pink, Chicago's newest personal stylist and future businesswoman of the year! I've only been here five seconds and you're embarrassing me already. I'm your best friend, I'm supposed to make a big deal of these things. I've missed your craziness. Aww. I've missed yours, too. Now, I took the liberty of ordering you a coffee. White, no sugar, decaf because caffeine keeps you up all night. You remembered! Of course, I did. Your dad didn't say that have two sides of the same brain for nothing. I, on the other hand, need all the caffeine I can get. Another bad date? He 'conveniently' left his wallet, so I had to pay for dinner, drinks and two rounds of mini-golf. - What? - Oh! And then, at the end of the night, he asked me for his cab fare home! Well, I take it you won't be seeing him again. Not unless I become a millionaire. But today isn't about me; today is about you. Are you ready to show me your studio? So ready, I could burst! Let's go! Okay, open your eyes. Rosie, I love it! Wait until you see inside. Come on. Okay, so, I still need to thank your mom for the couch, but other than that, I'm ready to go. This is amazing! I am so proud of you! And you even colour coordinated the dresses! Of course! Colour coordination is my job. Oh, and look, the flyers for my launch night arrived this morning. So classy. I just hope it brings in lots of customers. You won't need flyers for that; people will be biting off your arm for an appointment. I hope so. I really need this place to be a success. Just keep calm and do your thing. Your Grams left you that money because she believed in you. Did you finish your new website? Yes. I just need a few photos. You should give my cousin Jaxon. He's a professional photographer and I'm sure he would give you a discount. And sent. I don't need a professional. I'll just take the photos myself. With what? A selfie stick? Let Jaxon to help you. He's great at photographing people in the moment. Okay, I'll think about it. Good. Now, I got to get back to work. I've got six bridesmaids coming in for a wedding makeup trial, so, phew, wish me luck! Good luck! Hey, and let me know if feel like getting lunch. I'm so glad you're finally here. Bye. It looks amazing! Can I give you a flyer? Have a great day. Hi! Can I give you a flyer? New personal styling business right down the street. I use quality second-hand clothing, designer and retail, so everything's totally affordable, and we're having a launch night in just a few days. Okay. Okay. I hope to see you there. - Thank you. - Have a good day! Oh! Can I give you a flyer? Thank you. Did I hear you say that you're a personal stylist? You did. Can I trouble you for your opinion? - Oh, sure. - Okay. I'm useless at this. I'm going to a friend's wedding. Okay. Which dress, here, should I wear? - Both beautiful options. - Really? I would go... with the pink. The colour is more friendly and inviting, and it nips in here at the waist, so it'll show off your curves. - Ooh, do we want that? - Oh, absolutely. Okay. Um... great. Can I take a flyer? Oh, absolutely. - Thanks. - Come see me. - I will. - Okay. Bye! Hello. Styling by Pink. Oh, yes! Of course, you can book an appointment. When would you like to come in? Uh-huh. Yep, that's perfect. Thank you! Bye. Ooh! Oh! Someone's having way too much fun. I'm so sorry. I did not hear you come in! Clearly. Hi. I'm Rosie Pink. Welcome to my studio. Val Carcoza, editor-in-chief of Chicago Trend Magazine. Ooh... Would you like to book an appointment? No. Thank you. I'm actually here to satisfy my curiosity. My assistant informed me this morning that a new stylist had moved to town and, as a woman who likes to stay ahead of the trends, I thought I'd come down here and see what you're all about. Do you like what you see? So far? Yes. I'm getting a warm, cozy, artistic-chic vibe, contemporary... but not pretentious. That's me. Are these clothes all second-hand? Mm-hmm. With pre-loved items, I can give my clients the look that they want for a third of the price, plus upcycling is good for the environment. My magazine is always looking to interview local business owners. If I hear good things about your talents, I might be interested in doing a feature on your studio. Oh, wow, that would be amazing! I could definitely use the publicity. Well, I have two words for you: impress me. How do I do that? I'll be keeping an eye on you. Hello, Jaxon Brooks. Hi, Jaxon. It's Rosie Pink. I went to high school with your cousin Mel, and I was wondering... Sorry, my phone signal is bad. Can you come down to Washington Park? Come down to where? Hi. Are you Jaxon? Rosie Pink. Hey, listen, could you do me a favour and just stand right there while I take some test shots? Okay. Great. So, Rosie Pink, what were you trying to tell me on the phone earlier? Um, well, I was looking to hire a photographer to take some new photos of me for my website. I'm a personal stylist, so I'm... Ah, I should have known. You should have known what? Well, with a name like Rosie Pink, that you would be working in the fashion industry. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. It's just that most people that work in the fashion industry usually change their names to something super cool and artistic. Right? Well, that's a pretty big assumption to make. Is it? What's your real name? Well, my name is Pinkerton, but I shortened it to 'Pink' when I was twelve because it sounded cuter. There you go. Well, what's your real name then? 'Jaxon Brooks'? Just Jaxon Brooks. Although my first name is spelled with an 'X' 'cause my mom thought it would make me sound super cool and artistic. I really need to hire a photographer. I just started a new business and there's a really important person that I want to impress. So, I need someone to come down to my studio and take some photos of me collaborating with different clients. It'd be a two-week thing, fully paid. Are you up for the job? I don't really do fashion. What do you mean by that? I just find the entre industry... really superficial. My business is not superficial. It's actually all about providing a personal touch. I help change people's lives. By giving them, um, fashion makeovers? - Yes! - Okay. Look, are you gonna help me out or not? Because I'm new to the city and I really need these photos pretty quickly. I wouldn't even know where to begin with finding another photographer, especially at such short notice. Listen. I'm really sorry, but I'm, like, slammed for the next... three weeks or so. So, it'd probably be better idea if you went to go look for somebody else. Thanks for wasting my time. Thanks for wasting mine. Hey, Chase, can I call you back, man? I got a bad signal. I'm really sorry, man, that you didn't get the India shoot. The magazine said your portfolio didn't have enough spontaneity. Hey, no worries, man. I can't say I'm not disappointed, but you win some, you lose some, huh? You've been losing a lot more than you've been winning for a while now. The head of my division says we need to start dropping clients who aren't making us any money. What's that supposed to mean? Perhaps you'd be better off finding another agent. You're the best agent in town. Okay, look. I'll do... I'll do better. I'll do what it takes. I just heard this morning that World Traveller Magazine is looking to for a photographer for multiple contracts. Now, if you can get me some candid shots in the next few days, I'll put you forward for the job. You up for the challenge? Absolutely, and I think I know exactly where to start. Hello. Rosie Pink. Rosie Pink, it's Jaxon with an 'X'. Listen, I was thinking about your job offer and, great news, I've got some time. Oh, really? What happened to your slammed schedule? It became a little less slammed and your job would really help me out. Sorry, Jaxon with an 'X', but you've missed your chance. Bye! Unbelievable. No worries. Thanks anyway. Oh, I'm sorry, we're... closed. Hi. - Hi. - Some place. Thank you. Oh, um... I believe this belongs to you. Keep it. It's not really my style. Look, will you at least hear me out? I've heard enough, thank you. And besides, I've already found another photographer. Oh. You have? Yes. That's too bad. What's his name? Bill. Bill what? Bill with a 'B'. Look, I'm really sorry if I offended you earlier. I've just had some bad experiences working in the fashion industry, everyone was really rude and really snobby, and I don't want to go through that again. However, I can tell you're not like that, which is why I'm here to propose a deal. What kind of a deal? Well, it's recently been brought to my attention that I have to add some photos to my portfolio, and when you came and saw me this morning, you told me that you're in desperate need of some natural pictures with you and your clients. So, here's my deal, I will take your photographs for free, if I can also use those photographs in my portfolio. You want to put pictures of me in your portfolio? Well, I mean, not just of you; of you and your clients. Wouldn't you rather use a model? Ehh. Models are too contrived. I need someone real and awkward. Thank you. Oh, come on, I promise to give you lots of encouragement and direction. Please. You'd be doing me a huge solid. All right, Jaxon with an X, you've got yourself a deal. - Thank you. - Don't make me regret it. Oh. Oh, can I have one of those doughnuts, too, please? I thought you had a dinner date. I do, but you can never be too sure what actually constitutes dinner these days. Last month, a guy made me share a pizza. I had to get tacos on my way home. Oh. Hi, Mama. How's Florida? Yeah, everything's good. Mel and I are just getting coffee on the way home from work. Hi, Fiona! Hope you and Bob are getting into lots of mischief! Nothing, nothing. She's just choking on a donut. Yeah, everything's going really well. I've got a few clients booked in, and actually, Mel's cousin Jaxon is going to be taking some photos of me for the website. What? Since when?! Since I called him this morning. Why didn't you tell me sooner?! Because you were ordering a doughnut. Sorry, Mom. Yeah. Okay, tell Dad to make sure and wear sunscreen. Okay. I'll keep you updated. Love you. Bye. All right, so, this is my desk area. And then, there are various clothing samples on racks around the room. So, we've got our smart and casual over there, and our menswear and formal wear right there. And this here is my dressing room, and this is my cozy, comfy seating area, where I'll be meeting and chatting with all of my clients. I think it's really important to get to know my clients before I start choosing clothes for them. It's about more than just body size and shape. You know, it's about... their personal taste, too. So... Hmm. What's this thing? Oh, I also do colour consultations. Certain colours compliment certain skin tones. So, some people glow in warm tones, like yellow and orange, and some people sparkle in pastels and cool tone colours. No. Yes. I think you should wear more green tones to compliment your eyes. So, people pay good money for this kind of thing, huh? Yeah. You'll understand when you meet my clients. We're gonna have to talk about your definitely of comfortable. Oh, hi, Abby, good to see you again. Hi. Yeah, you too! - Welcome. - Wow. Beautiful. Thank you. Hey, before we get started, would it be all right if my friend Jaxon here took some photos of our session? I'm hoping to feature some of my new clients on my website. - Ehh. - No pressure to say yes. Sure, yeah, that'd be okay... as long as he gets my good side. I can handle that. So, you told me on the phone that were looking for an outfit for an interview? Yes. I have an interview with this really cool fashion company, so I need something trendy yet sophisticated. Okay. And what do you normally wear to work? I'm a stay-at-home mom, I have been five years. So, the bulk of my wardrobe is covered in paint and baby drool. How many kids do you have? Three boys. They keep me busy. But, you know, I have to say, I... I think I'm feeling guilty about leaving them to go back to work. I think it's natural to feel like that. I know a lot of moms who feel the same way. Yeah, I know, I know. It'll be good for me. It just... It's got me feeling out of the loop, you know? With everything. Not to mention, you know, having three babies back-to-back has kind of wreaked havoc with my body. I don't know what to wear anymore. Okay, don't worry. I've got your back. We will find you some bold statement outfits that make you feel like you mean business. - Okay. - Now, before we do that, I like to ask you a few quick-fire questions. This is something I do with all of my clients. So, just clear your mind and say the first thing that comes into your head. - Okay. - Okay? Here we go. Do you like your clothes plain or patterned? Um, patterned. Okay. Overstated or understated? - Uh, can I say both? - Yes, definitely. - Your least favourite colour. - Red? - And your favourite ice cream. - Mint chip. Oh, mine too. Okay, let's get started! Oh, nice. - Beautiful. - Yes. - Beautiful! - Right? - Stunning! - I love it! Okay, I think I'm shopped out. Good luck at your interview. - Thanks for everything. - My pleasure. One more shot? Let's do it. - Perfect. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye now. Okay, I admit it, your job's pretty fun. And definitely not superficial? And definitely not superficial. Although, I found it really interesting how you get your clients to trust you. What do you mean? You ask a lot of questions. I ask the right questions. I want my clients to know that I really care about them. Plus, having a chat helps them relax. It's not easy to drop your guard and be vulnerable in front of a complete stranger. Yeah, that's fair. When's your next client? That's it for today, so you can head home early if you want? I have a better idea, why don't we both head off early and go for a walk? This lighting is really good to get some street shots. Okay. Is my outfit okay? Oh, I don't know about that dress. Oh. I can change into pants if you want. I'm kidding. You look fine. Stop messing with me! You're making me nervous. Look, just, let's have some fun, forget the camera's even there. Ugh! Oh! Not so close! Okay, I'm sorry. Oh... The city makes me feel so tiny. Like a little ant lost in a maze. - What are you doing? - Keep looking at the buildings. Okay. So, how did you become a professional photographer? Did you go to photography school? Nope. My father taught me. Well, at least he taught me how to put a roll of film into a camera and then use it. But everything after that was just practise and determination. But how do you know what to take a photo of? Or how to find the right lighting? I dunno, the composition just feels right. How do you know when an outfit looks good on a client? I just know, I guess. Yeah, and knowing their favourite ice cream flavour probably doesn't hurt. Oh, definitely not. So, did you go to fashion school to learn how to be a stylist? No. I actually learned most of what I know from watching my Grandma Ada. She was a wiz on the sewing machine, so all of our neighbours would come to our house when they needed a dress fixed up for a special occasion. And if they didn't have anything nice enough to fix up, she would go in her closet and pick out a bunch of clothes and whip them up a fabulous outfit. Oh, she sounds cool. Yeah. I just hope I'm making her proud. Your favourite ice cream flavour is mint chocolate chip, right? Right. - How's your ice cream? - Amazing. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. I can tell, you got it all over your nose. Really?! No, I just wanted to pull a different expression. Okay, if this was not so amazing, I would shove it right in your face. Hey, Gramps. Got your bacon and egg bagel, cream cheese, and one orange juice, no pulp. Ahh, you treat me like a king. Oh, hey, listen, I got you a dentist appointment on the 17th, so don't forget to put that in your calendar. Dentist, 17th, got it. Yeah. Don't you have your poetry meet? Ehh, need to be there in ten minutes. It's three blocks that way? Yep, just taking a detour. Okay. Ha-ha. I know what you're doing, Gramps. I just want to say a quick hello to the young lady who's keeping you busy. What's the big deal? Hi! - Oh! - Oh, sorry! Did I startle you? No, no. That was just what I needed to jump-start my morning. Rosie, I'd like to introduce you to my Grandpa Wilbur. Nice to meet you, Grandpa Wilbur. It's nice to meet you, too. Jaxon tells me that you're a 'fashionista'? Ah, no. I didn't say that. What I said was that she's a personal stylist and she changes people's lives by giving them fashion makeovers. Oh, I see. Young people come up with all kinds of weird and wonderful ways to make their money these days. Well, if you'd like to see what I do, I'd be happy to give you a free styling consultation. Oh, it's a kind offer, but I think your efforts would be wasted on an old-timer like me. Why don't you style Jaxon? He's had that old shirt he's wearing for about ten years. - Oh... - What's wrong with my shirt?! Anyways, I'd better get off to my poetry meet. I'm doing a reading of one of my limericks, so I gotta shake out my nerves. It was good to meet you, Rosie. Good to meet you, too. Hmm... Well, you kids have fun now. - Yeah, yeah. - Good luck. Thank you! Well, I have been dipping my toes in the online dating world, but... I still don't really have the courage to swipe right. I mean, there is this girl Kimmy and I would really like to go on a date with her. So, go for it. What's stopping you? Oh, she's so pretty, and all my friends, they tell me that I'm too nerdy to even get a girlfriend. I mean, they're probably right; I have no idea how to dress to impress. Derek, first of all, get some nicer friends. Second of all, don't let anyone tell you that you're not good enough to go after something that you want. Style is about more than just the clothes you wear; it's about the way that you feel about yourself inside. I can help you with your style, but first, I want you to believe in yourself. Believe in myself? How do I do that? Swipe right on Kimmy. No, I can't do that. Yes, you can. I believe in you. What have you got to lose? You gotta go for it, man. I mean, I know it it can be awkward if you've never done something like this before, but I promise you won't regret it. Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay! Well, let's get to work. I love it! Blue is definitely your colour. Wow, look at me. I look like Clark Kent. Oh, wow. It's Kimmy. She matched with me! What do I say? I'm not good with words. Just say hi. He can't just say 'hi'. You want to ask her a question. You want to get a conversation going, right? Oh, I didn't know you were the expert in the arena. Ask her what her favourite food is. - He can't ask that. - Why? Because it sounds like he's asking her out dinner. Well, isn't that the point? Well, what happened to getting a conversation going and easing into asking her out? Yeah, but you want that conversation to be leading somewhere, otherwise, you'll just end up talking about the weather for weeks. How about I ask her how her day is? And then, if she responds, then I can ask her what her favourite food is. There it is. I like that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think you're better at this than you think you are. Okay, why don't you open up to me a little bit? Give me a big smile. Yeah, okay. Let's relax our shoulders, okay? Look at me. Just shake it out. - Okay. All right. - Give me one of those. - Mm-hmm. - Very nice. Deep breath. And big smile! There she is! Look at that! All right, how about a silly face? - Gimme a silly face! - Okay. Um... - Ugh. - That's perfect. - Yeah? - That's exactly what I wanted. Okay. That's nice. - No. - Yeah! No! This is so awkward. Okay, keep going. Oh! That one's nice. - This one? - Yeah. That is nice. I like that. - That's not bad. - Good choice. I just gotta take this. Hey. Hey, man, how's it going with the new shots? Really good, actually. Can you ping them over to me? My boss has been on my back about keeping you on, so I want to get your submission in to World Traveller ASAP. Absolutely. I'll get them to you as soon as possible. There's just... there's a few more shots that I need. As long as it is tomorrow. There's only so long I can keep talking you up for. Absolutely. No. You can count on me. Who was that? One of your online girlfriends? Yes. Yes, that was Pamela. Or was it Sandra? It could have been Rita. There's so many names, I lose track. Funny. That was my agent Chase. He's been pressing me to get these pictures in as soon as possible, but I still need some with a greener setting. How would you feel about a quick trip to the lake? Why don't you take Pamela or Rita? I would, but... they're busy on Tuesdays, which is today. Okay. Let me grab my jacket. Great. Oh, it's so beautiful here. I can't believe we're only twenty minutes from the city. Yeah. It's one of my favourite spots. I like to come here any time I have to clear my head or get some perspective. It's my happy place. I might have to steal your happy place. All right, I think I'm done with this set up. But I do have one more idea for a creative shot, if you'd like to follow me... Okay. All right, so here's what I want you to do, lean on the tree, maybe kick your one leg out this way, get really comfy. You want me to get in the tree? I want you to get into the tree. Sit on that side, and then you can throw your feet up on the other side, that'd be great, yep. Okay, what do we think? I like it, I like it. I'm in the tree. Give me a big... Give me a big spread. - Okay. - All right. Are you messing with me? I am absolutely messing with you. So, right now, your left hand is in Illinois and your right hand is in Indiana, and the tree you're sitting in straddles the state line. I've never been to Indiana before. That's amazing. And there's that real smile. Hi. Hey, thank you. - No problem. - That's nice. Where did you get this from? Deli up the street. It's been a busy morning; you gotta eat. Mmm. This is delicious. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. I didn't know you were having an official launch party. Yeah, it's in ten days and I feel totally unprepared. I was just emailing out some invites to some high schools and some community centres. The more people I can reach, the better. Are you afraid no one's gonna show up? I am, actually, but thank you for highlighting my worst fear. I'm happy to help. Must be tough opening a business in a new city. The struggle is real. Why Chicago? Are you Rosie Pink? I am. Oh... I'm so glad I found you. I am having a literal fashion nightmare. You've come to the right place. It's all gonna be okay. Tell me what happened. Okay, so, I was in the middle of having brunch with some of my girlfriends, right? And then, my little brother Taylor calls me and tells me that I have been named Craze MG's worst dressed celebrity of the week. Craze MG? Yeah, it's like this online magazine that posts all this random news about celebrities. I didn't even know I was a celebrity. I was in, like, one small indie movie, but apparently, that is enough for them to follow you to Food Mart. They photographed me wearing my favourite sweatpants seven times. - Look! - Oh, no. And normally, I would just ignore that kind of thing, but I'm just so worried that they're going to judge what I'm wearing and just... Can you please help me find some new outfits? I'm just so bad at fashion. I can definitely help you find some new outfits, but you should buy new clothes because you like them, not because you feel pressured into it. Can I buy comfy clothes that still are stylish? Of course, you can. In fact... Okay, let me see here... No. No. Okay. What do you think? Can we try it? Of course, we can! Come on. Okay. Eat your heart out, Craze MG. Oh, now, this is what I call casual chic. Everybody needs a little colour in their lives. Oh, do you think your assistant with the camera would mind taking some photos of me? My social media accounts need to do some serious damage control. I think that my assistant would be happy to help. Right, Jaxon? I'd love to. I would be forever grateful. Let's get these critics to eat their words. Alright, let's take a big step back. Throw the curtains open, first reveal. Bang, there's one. Two. Let's see what else you got. Bring it out this way a little bit. Drop those sunglasses. And bang, there it is. Lovely. Beautiful. Thank you so much. You're like the big sister I never had, but the one with awesome fashion sense. Well, I am so glad that I could help. Hey, would you mind if we posted some of the photos that Jaxon took on our social media? Sure. I mean, the more people that see them the better, right? Totally. - Okay, bye! - Bye! Phew! That was unexpected. Yeah, it was a crazy day. But I do love an unexpected fashion makeover. I am starving now, though. Is there a good place to eat around here? Yeah, there's an amazing pizza joint around the corner, actually. I could totally eat an entire pizza right now. Do you think they could get a table for us? For, like... for you and me? No, for me and that mannequin wearing the pink dress? Yes, for you and me. I could pay you back for lunch this afternoon. Yeah, okay, that sounds good. - Okay, great. - Great. So, I've been coming here since before I could walk. You cannot live in Chicago and not try Chicago's finest deep dish. And that's a law, is it? It's one of my laws. So, you never answered my question from earlier. What question? What brought you to Chicago? Did you just get bored of your hometown? Something like that. Great! This is usually where you start elaborating. I don't know, I guess I just kind of outgrew it. All my friends got married and moved away, and I felt stuck. I needed a fresh start. No opportunities. I can relate to that. I lived with a couple of friends from college and they left me to move to the suburbs with their girlfriends. Oh. How inconsiderate. I tried to tell them; they wouldn't listen. So, what about your parents? How do they feel about you moving to the big city? Well, last year, they decided that they hadn't seen enough of the country, so they took early retirement and bought a camper van and hit the road. - Wow. - Mm-hmm. How inconsiderate, indeed. - No, no, I'm happy for them. - That's great. They deserve to have a little fun. So, you're just, um... living on... On your own, then? Yep. Just me. No boyfriend or anything to keep you company? No. What about you? No. Just me, all on my lonesome. I thought you were Chicago's online dating expert. Contrary to popular belief, I am... not an expert. No, I just, um... I go on a few dates here and there, but... I'm just focused on my work. Yeah. I'm kind of like you in that way. Yeah? My last relationship was dramatic. So, I'm focusing on myself and my studio. That's really my priority. Ooh, look at that. - Oh, my gosh. - Thank you. This is so cheesy. How are we supposed to eat this? With your hands; that's the only way to eat a pizza. Here you go. - Okay! - Enjoy that. I'll take this one. - Try it. - All right, here we go. Mmm. I got to get a picture of this. - No! - Yes! You try and eat this elegantly! No, I can't. There's no way to do it. Watch. I'll show you. I think we're gonna need a few more napkins. You're probably right. - This is really good. - Mm-hmm. The next time that waiter sees you, he's probably going to give you a bib. Oh, I'm sure he will, absolutely. So, um... which way is home for you? Oh, um... I'm actually just five blocks this way. I'm five blocks that way, but I'd be happy to walk you home. No, that's okay. I can see my apartment from here, I'll be fine. You sure? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Bye. See ya... tomorrow. Sorry I'm late. I started talking to that cute guy at the coffee stand. He's taking me out later. This might be a bit cold now. What happened to the last guy you were dating? Ehh. I wasn't feeling him. Plus, he admitted to owning a dozen cats. I don't need that in my life. Maybe you should focus your attention elsewhere for a bit. What happened to the idea of owning your own beauty parlour? You've been talking about that for years. Well, I'm still talking about it. But I also want to find someone special to spend my life with. Don't you want that, too? I guess so, at some point. On a completely unrelated note, I heard you and Jaxon went to dinner last night. Oh, where did you hear that? Jaxon mentioned it to his mom, who told my mom, who told me. So, come on, spill. Nothing to spill. We just had pizza together after a very long day of work. Mm-hmm. I don't entirely believe you. But I'm late for my first client, so we will talk more about this later. Thank you. - Bye, Mel. - Love you! Okay, let's see. What do we like? This... Oh, Miss Carcoza. Val. I didn't know you were stopping by today. Neither did I, until I went online and saw your photos of a delightful young actress wearing a bright pant and a bold print top. Interesting style choice, but somehow you made it work. - You liked the look. - Very much so. I was impressed with how you managed to find the right balance between cozy Sunday afternoon and festival flair. In addition to being featured in Chicago Trend, how would you feel about lending your talents to my magazine as a stylist? I'm about to launch a new feature on fashionable daywear and I thought you have the perfect vibe to style the first shoot. Fully paid, of course. Oh! Oh, my gosh. Yes, I would love that. Do you think you and your team could recreate that same magic in an outdoor setting? Absolutely. I will call them right now. I'll be in touch. Hi, Jaxon. It's Rosie. You know you said that you love fashion shoots? Oh, hi! Hey! You owe me for this. I'll pay you back in cheesy pizza. Okay, let's do it! - Yes! - Okay, let's go! - Hey. - Hey, how's it going? Rosie, I cannot thank you enough. Ever since those photos went live, my phone has been ringing nonstop. I've got seven audition offers, a new brand of sweat pants wants me to be their ambassador, and my ex-boyfriend Chad, he was never really nice to me in high school, he messaged me and asked me if I wanted to "catch up". Well, sorry, Chad, but the only catching up you'll be doing is with my face on TV. Well, that's how you turn lemons into lemonade. We almost ready? Yeah, just one last finishing touch. - Okay. - Okay, you're ready. All right. Oh... Okay. Well, she looks amazing. Oh, she is a talker! Big gesture. Nice. Let's go. Do one of these. There we go. All right. Very nice. Very nice. Beautiful. Oh, I think I'm caught. Oh, I got it. - Here, let me get back there. - Thank you. Okay, all right. Yes. Okay, let's see. Okay. Okay, all right, there we go. - We all good? - Yeah. You look beautiful. Thank you. All right, another big one. There you go! There it is. Thank you so much for agreeing to do the shoot. Oh, are you kidding? I get to be in Chicago Trend magazine; that's like my childhood dream come true. Oh! Glad you had a great day. You guys should come to my birthday drinks next week. I'm having a thing downtown. - Sounds great. - We'll be there. Okay. I will text you the details. All right. Thanks again. Bye. I think that went really well. Yeah. Oh, and you were very good at the whole fashion photography thing. I think you should do it full time. I think I'll stick to photographing couples in the woods. You were having fun, admit it. No, I wasn't. Yes, you were. I saw you. Okay, maybe I was having a tiny minute of fun. I am starving. Do you guys want to get dinner? Oh, shoot. I totally wish I could, but I've got to go get ready for that thing I have tonight. What thing? You know, that thing I was telling you about the other day, but you guys should stay out, though. Maybe go somewhere nice to celebrate. Maybe. Well, I'd better dash. Bye! Don't mind her. I think she's had too much sun. No, she's always been weird. Hey, listen, I would really like to have dinner with you, but I kind of promised my grandpa that we would get takeout and I don't really want to let him down. No, no, no, of course. No worries. But listen, you're more than welcome to join, if you like. I wouldn't want to impose. I'm inviting you. Okay. What kind of takeout are you getting? Chinese, Grandpa Wilbur's favourite. Sounds good to me. Hey, Gramps! I hope you brought my egg rolls. Yeah, I brought your egg rolls... and a surprise guest. Oh, hey there, Rosie. I mean, it's a pretty good job. I... I just love seeing people's faces light up when they look in the mirror and they finally feel happy with what they're wearing. Oh. You know what I've just realized? You are the first woman that Jaxon has ever brought 'round to my house. Heh. Grandpa... I was starting to worry he wasn't living his life to the fullest because he's always observing it through his camera. Maybe I don't bring women around house because you embarrass me in front of my friends. Oh, okay. So, you like John Keats? Oh, yes. Nothing like rereading the classics on a Sunday afternoon. I studied a few of his poems in high school. From what I remember, he was quite the romantic. Oh. Hi, Wilbur. Would you like some of my homemade mini muffins? I made enough to feed a whole schoolyard. Oh, thanks, Eileen. I do love your mini muffins. Okay. Enjoy. Wilbur, who was that? Oh, that's Eileen, my new neighbour. She bakes the best lemon poppy seed muffins in three counties. So, is Eileen just a neighbour? Why do you ask? I noticed a bit of a vibe between the two of you. Oh no, that was just her being friendly. Trust me, a girl always knows how many mini muffins she's making. I think she likes you. Well, to tell you the truth, I have been contemplating asking her out ever since she first moved in, but I keep losing my nerve. Oh, you should do it. What do you have to lose? Well, she got say no. Then, I'll never be able to sit my garden ever again. You know what would give you a confidence boost? A fashion makeover. Oh, yeah, I don't think so. Come on. We can pick you out a smart new outfit and Eileen will not be able to resist you. Okay, I'll think about it. The new outfit, that is. Jury's still out on Eileen. I do have some time tomorrow at my studio, if you want to come by. Say 4:00 PM? Just promise me you won't put me in a pair of skinny pant s that you youngsters like to wear. No promises. May I use your powder room? Oh, sure. Upstairs, second door on the right. Thanks. Sorry. I don't mean to scare you. I was just making sure you didn't lost. No. Are these all of your photographs? Yeah. He has a weird way of showing it, but my grandpa's my biggest fan. I love your portraits. You have a real talent for showing people's true essence. Thank you. I've got a thing for taking pictures of people's faces. I love capturing people's stories through the light in their eyes and the lines in their smile. One of my life goals is to travel the world and take pictures of people from different cultures. That's a pretty cool goal. Yeah. A pretty expensive goal. Yeah. Listen, I've been meaning to talk to you. I didn't want to say anything before, but... there's a reason I have to expand my portfolio. My agent's been talking about dropping me. I haven't been booking a lot of gigs lately and he basically said to either step up or step out. He's given me one last chance to prove myself by putting me up for an interview at World Traveller Magazine, and if I get that gig, then I get paid to travel the world. Wow. And you're going to use the photos you've been taking me to help you get that job? Yeah, that was the idea. Yeah. Okay, well, I wish I'd taken those sessions a little more seriously. No, you did great. So, if you get this job, how often will you be gone? Probably a few weeks at a time. I couldn't do the being on the road for months on end thing. There's just too many people here in Chicago I'd miss. I just hope that my portfolio ends up being impressive enough to score me an interview. I'd give anything to get in the room with their editors. What if you created your own room? How do you mean? What if you displayed your work at my studio? I have a launch night in less than a week and there is nothing hanging on the walls. So, you could invite the team from World Traveller Magazine and you could charm them into giving you the job. Uh... Okay, if I have learned anything in the last few weeks, it's that you can't just sit around waiting for success to come to you; you have to make things happen. You only regret the chances in life that you don't take. I think you could do this and I want to help you. Okay. Okay. Jaxon, where you at? Did you eat my noodles? It's been a long day. I should... I should probably get going. Yeah. Um... I'll call you a cab. Yeah, thanks. So, you just left? Well, it was getting late. I wanted to give him some good time with his grandpa. You mean you wimped out. I did not wimp out. You do this with every guy that shows any interest. If you keep annoying me, I'm not going to take you out to dinner tonight. Fine. Silence me with a promise of pizza. There's a fork in the drawer there. How did it go with cute coffee stand guy? Only okay. He was nice to look at, but we didn't really have much in common. Plus, he spent most of the night talking about football and cars. Oh... And he hates comic book movies. That's not gonna work. Well, maybe I'm being too fussy. Mel, you have been talking about your dream guy since you were eight years old. This guy does not sound like he's it. I want you to hold out for someone special, a guy who loves tacos and is excited to watch a 12-hour Marvel marathon. Yeah, that's the dream. I think he's out there. He's probably looking for you, too. Well, if you run into him, give me a call. In the meantime, I got to get back to work. Hey, maybe the love of my life will come in for a manicure. I hope so. Hello. Styling by Pink. One moment, please. It's someone named Val Carcoza. Val... I'll be back at six, ready for my pizza. Okay. Bye. Hi, Val. Rosie, darling, how are you? I'm good. Thanks. How are you? Are you happy with the photographs from the park shoot? I adore them; exactly what I wanted. Listen, how would you like to freelance for me on a regular basis? A spot just opened up on my team and I need to hire a stylist that I can trust. Oh, wow. I'm... I'm really flattered by the offer. I've just opened up my studio. My launch night's in one week. I'm more than happy to accommodate your other commitments. Why don't you come see me for a chat? I'll give you a tour of the studio. I have a client coming in at 4:00. Then we'll make it a quick tour. Okay, I'll be there ASAP. Thanks, Val. This is where we do all of our main shoots. We stage as much as we can right here in the studio, but we also have green screen facilities. That's pretty cool. Lots of lights. Yes. Our lead creative Fredrik is very particular about lighting. He's the photographer that I'll be pairing you up with if you decide to take the job. I know you're concerned about neglecting your studio, but working here would only extend your client base and list of contacts. Think of all the people in the industry that you'll get to meet. Plus, you'll be inspiring women all over Chicago to make bold fashion choices. It sounds pretty good, but... But if you are still undecided, follow me. Maybe this will sway you. Go ahead. Take a look. Are these... all couture? R&D. And these are just some of the clothes you'll get to play with if you work for me. Okay, when do I start? Follow me. Wilbur? Wilbur? He's not here. Wilbur? Wilbur, are you okay? Why didn't you show up for your styling appointment? Because it would have been a waste of time. What makes you say that? Eileen isn't gonna want to date an old crank like me. Of course she will. You're smart and funny and you write poetry, and we already know you make her smile. But what if it isn't enough? Well, you'll never know unless you ask her out. Take a chance. It's better than sitting around here, moping. I don't want to look like a fool. I bet that John Keats wasn't afraid to look like a fool over a girl. In fact, I think I remember that he wrote a bunch of love letters to his neighbour and then married her. John Keats was 18 years old. You are never too young or too old for romance... or a new outfit. All right. You look great. Come in! Ta-da! What do you think? Wow, Gramps. You look amazing. I just can't that's my reflection or that I'm wearing the colour pink. Oh, come on, it suits you. Pink is friendly and inviting and Eileen will love it. Hmm. All right, I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna ask her out. Okay, what are you going to say? Uh, well, I've kind of written her a poem. Is that corny? No! Will you share it with us? Uh... Oh... Dear Eileen, I see you every morning, your smile is like the sun, I'd like to get to know you, but I won't jump the gun, I like walks and films and cakes and I make great cups of tea, So, answer me one thing, Eileen, will you go out with me? That is sweet. You sound like a Hallmark Card; she's gonna love it. Oh... All right. Well, I'll let you know what happens. All right. You did all right. Wow, she's beautiful. Yeah. Try spending all day with her. She's one of those rare people that has such a beautiful story behind her eyes. Hey, so, why'd you go down to the Trend earlier? Was there something wrong with the photos we took from the shoot? No. Val offered me a freelance stylist job. That's amazing. Yeah. That's... awesome. Are you gonna take it? I kind of already have. I have no idea how I'm going to fit it in with everything. But I'll only be working when I'm needed, so... That's... Wow. Congratulations. You're gonna keep the studio, though, right? Oh, of course. I could never give up giving fashion makeovers; it's what I live for. Derek? Sorry to drop in like this, but I just didn't know who else to turn to. What's happened? Well, I went on my first date with Kimmy. I thought things were going fine, until she said that she didn't see us together in the future. Oh, no. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Oh, just hold that thought. Hello. Styling by Pink. Mm-hmm. - Hey. - Hey. I like your T-shirt. Thanks. Can you hold on a minute? Derek, this is my best friend Mel. We were about to go out for pizza. Do you want to join us? Oh, I don't want to intrude and be the third wheel. Oh, it's okay. Jaxon's gonna be there, too. Aren't you, Jaxon? Huh? Yeah. Yeah. See? Derek had a bad first date, so... he needs cheering up. Oh, well, I'm really good at cheering people up. Oh, this is my favourite pizza place. Oh... After you. Oh, why hank you. Oh, Jaxon, could you help me fetch the menus? I mean, we don't have to fetch anything because they bring them. Oh, I'm really hungry. Right. Okay. Yeah, let's grab some menus, then. So, I really love vegetarian pizza, but then I add bacon, ham and sausage. Wow. Those are like my favourite things. - Me too. - Yeah. What are we doing? I want to give Mel and Derek some alone time. I think they're really hitting it off. Look how cute they are. I don't know why I didn't think of this before. Hey, Gramps. Oh, how did you go with Eileen? She said yes. Hang on. Let me put you on speakerphone. Great news, Wilbur. Yeah, it was great for about five minutes. Now, I'm a jiggering bundle of nerves. Why? What happened? Asking a woman out is one thing. Impressing her on a date, whole other ballgame. I haven't been on a date for over 50 years. What if I say the wrong thing? You won't say the wrong thing. - Ehh... - He might. I hope you're both free tomorrow afternoon, as I need you to accompany me on the date. What? Why? When I get nervous, I start to ramble. I'm gonna need someone else there to save me, in case I start talking stupid. I can't just take Jaxon along with me; it'd look like I brought a babysitter. I needed to look like a double date. Where's the date? Oh, wow. May I take your jacket? Oh, that's very kind. Thank you. That looks really fun. - This is my favourite song. - Well, would you like to dance? - They're good. - They're really good. I was just gonna say the same... Okay. All right. Wow. I had no idea my grandfather could dance like that. Look at them go. I've never seen him so confident. I think it's his outfit. It's gotta be. Uh, would you like to dance? Do you know how to dance like this? No. No, not at all. But I figure if we just copy whatever they're doing, we could look just as cool. I think it might be a disaster, but... - Yeah. - I'm gonna go for it. It's definitely gonna be a disaster. Whoo! Wow! Those are moves! I'm... I'm working on them. - Oh. - I was just getting into it. That was fun. I thought... I thought I had it down pat there. Yeah. So, listen, um... I've been meaning to ask you, would it be okay with you if I donated a photograph I took of you to a charity auction? The youth club that I volunteer at, they're having a fundraiser this Wednesday night. You volunteer at a youth club? Yes. Well, I... I teach photography once or twice a month. How come you haven't mentioned it? Never came up. I'm actually also doing a speech, which I'm really nervous about because I don't know anything about public speaking. And I just found out today that Zoe Yang, the lead editor of World Travel Magazine. is going to be there, and I really just don't want to make a giant dork of myself. And why would you make a giant dork of yourself? What if I stutter or something? It's going to leave an awful first impression. I'm really nervous! I can see that! Okay. Would it make you less nervous if I went with you? You wanna go to the event with me? You've ever been there to support me more than once this week. You could give the speech directly to me and forget that anyone else is in the room. Um, yeah, I think that would really help. - Yeah? - I'd really like that. Okay. Oh. - Sorry. - No, of course. Yeah. - I gotta it. - Yeah. Yeah. Hello? Rosie, I need you to come down to Chicago Trend right away. Frederick is here, he wants to meet you. Um, could we actually reschedule? I'm kind of in the middle of something. This is the only time that I can get you together before your big shoot, and we'll lose a lot of time if we have to discuss details on the day. Yeah. I'll be there ASAP. I'm sorry. I gotta go. No, no, no. That's okay. It's a great opportunity. - This is good. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Hey. Apologize to Wilbur for me? Yes, of course. Hey, thanks for the dance. Rosie, this is Frederick Levine, the photographer that you'll be working with on your next few shoots - and your model Natasha. Hi. Great to meet you both. I'm envisioning for our first shoot to have an artistic avant-garde vibe in an environment of illuminated spheres. Do you think you could make Natasha look like a piece of art? Of course. To create a cool, avant-garde look, I'd pick out an outfit that highlights geometric shapes, using gold accents to bring in the luminescence in the space. We could even give Natasha a round statement hat, something soft and circular that brings that shape to her face. I think I saw one in the storage cupboard. Be my guest. Okay. Be right back. I told you she was a bright spark. Mm-hmm. I think the composition needs more edge. Sure. Edge... Okay. Edge... No. Oh, yes. Yes. Okay. All right. Let's see. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, perfect. You look beautiful. All right. Okay. Hi, Rosie. - Excellent shoot today. - Thanks. Oh, before I forget, the dresses on these rails are all from previous shoots, so you can take whatever you like back to your studio. Yes! Oh, my goodness, look at that. Oh... Chase, tell me you have some good news for me. Well, for once, I do. World Traveller Magazine loved your photos. I got the interview. You got the interview! Yes! Thank you! Just make sure you impress Zoe Yang at that charity event tomorrow night. I'll do my best. Talk soon. Oh! Thank you. Okay, thanks. Thank you. He's just so smart and funny and cute and dorky, and I totally know that you set us up, but I'm glad you did because he makes me smile ear to ear. We're going to the movies tonight to watch the Superman revival. That is very fitting. How's the prep going for the launch party? Well, I actually haven't done any. Why not? I have been so busy at Chicago Trend. Val runs a very tight ship. Tell me you've at least ordered some champagne glasses. - No. - Leave it to me. I'll see if I can borrow some from the bar opposite my apartment. Thank you. You are the best. I am the best. Ugh. Okay. I got to get going. I'm sorry. Thank you again. Muah! Love you. Love you. Val? I'm on my way. Rosie, could you come over here and adjust Natasha's hemline? Mm-hmm. Okay, let's try this. All right. Ugh. We need to rethink Natasha's outfit. It's too baggy. Well, I have some other dresses selected, if you'd like to take a look. I like what she's wearing. It just needs to be tighter. Can you take it in? I can, but it'll have to be tomorrow. I'm leaving in 30 minutes for a charity event. I'm sorry, but you'll have to cancel your plans. Natasha's flying to Rome in the morning, so we need to get this shoot finished tonight. Hey, I finally caught you. Hey. I'm so sorry I've been MIA recently. I've just been so busy. Oh, that's okay. Did you get my message about tonight? Unfortunately, that's why I'm calling. I'm not going to be able to make it. The shoot I'm working on is not going well, and now Frederik needs me to alter a dress. Oh, you can't just use a new dress? No, he's very particular. I have to stay until the shoot is done. I'm so sorry. I know how much this night means to you. Hey, that's okay. You got to do what you've got to do. I really wanted to be there for your speech. Ah, I'm sure I'll make it work. I'll just stare at the clock at the back of the room or something. Let me know how it goes. Okay? And, um, don't forget to bring your photos to my studio. I'll be there on Friday. Yeah, will do. Hey, what was the good news you wanted to tell me? Oh, I just... I really wanted to tell you in person, but I guess I can do it right now. Rosie, where are you? Oh, I got to go, Jaxon. Good luck. I'll call you later. Okay. Yeah. Length's perfect. Okay. Let's see. Okay. Oh, sorry. Val? Rosie, dear, sorry to interrupt you again. I have three more dates I need to book you in for. Frederick also wants to know if you can spare an hour after lunch, as he needs help with the reshoot. Val, I really cannot come in today. I have clients booked in, and plus, I need to get some things ready for my launch night. You can't spare an hour? He really is in a bind. All right, tell them I'll be there at four. Don't worry. We'll get you done. Okay. So, the shoot's Wednesday to Friday? I can't really be away from the studio that long. Could I just fly in on the Wednesday? Hi! Would you put those in the back? - Sure, yeah. - Thank you. Thank you. What if I come in on Wednesday, but I pick out multiple outfits? Oh, Val, hang on just a second. Hi. Styling by Pink. Oh, I would love to help, but I am booked out on a private shoot for the next eight days. I'm so sorry. Thank you again. Bye. Sorry, Val. What were you saying? Okay, well, if there's a problem, you could always just video call me. I'm really sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to let you know really quick before I leave, I got an interview. - World Traveller? - Yeah. Val, hang on just a second. I'm so happy for you. When is it? Monday morning. You are going to ace it! I hope so. Val, just a second. Can I call you later? Yeah, sure. Um... Did you still want to do Scarlett's birthday drinks tonight? - Yeah. - So, be here around 8:30? - Yeah, sounds good. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Okay, Val, well, what if I come in on the Wednesday, but I pick out everything beforehand? Hey, Gramps. You're dressed up for going to the store, aren't you? Oh, I just went to go see Rosie. Oh... You tell her about your interview? Yeah, I did. She's very excited for me. You sure about that? Yeah. Grandpa, Rosie and I are just friends. That doesn't mean to say she's okay with you leaving. Hey. What time is it? 8:30. Why are you still working? I'm sorry. I didn't realize what time it was. If I'm honest, I don't even know what day it is anymore. It's Friday. Look, Rosie, I, um... I didn't want to say anything, but maybe it's a good idea if you just take a couple of steps back. I mean, you've been working what? Every single day for two weeks straight. I have to work every day to get stuff done. People are relying on me. Look, I get that, I do. But you still have to think about yourself. I mean, why are you letting Val run you ragged? I'm not letting her do anything. I'm doing what I need to do to be successful. You don't need Val to be successful. It's what you do in this studio that makes you special. I mean, does working for the Trend even make you happy? Does it need to? Yeah, it should. It really should... if it means working this hard and neglecting the people that care about you. Well, maybe if you worked this hard, you would be traveling the world already, instead of taking photographs in the park. Okay. Jaxon... Hey, Val, do you have a minute? Oh, Rosie, I was just going to come find you. I have the proofs for the feature on your studio. What do you think? Oh... it's fabulous. Glad you think so because it's about to go to print. I invited some of my most influential designer friends to your launch night; they're excited to meet you. Val... I can't do this anymore. Excuse me? I am really sorry, but I cannot continue to work for you. I'm so grateful for the opportunity, but I miss my studio. I miss styling people for weddings and bar mitzvahs, and I miss doing fashion makeovers that give people the confidence to make big changes. It's a personal part of my job that I love, and, um... I'm really sorry to let you down. But my heart is just not happy here. I see. Well, I can't say that I am not disappointed. But I admire your honesty. It's an attribute that makes you an excellent stylist. You should follow your passion. Thank you for understanding. And if you're ever stuck for work, you're always welcome at Chicago Trend. Thanks, Val. All right... Mm-hmm. Jaxon Hi, this is Jaxon. I can't answer your call right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you ASAP. Hi, this is Jaxon. I can't answer your call right now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you ASAP. Hey, I'm here with the champagne glasses. Oh, wow, that looks amazing. Oh, this party is going to be a huge success. I hope so. What's with the frown? You still haven't spoken with Jaxon. I've tried calling him a few times, but he still hasn't answered... which is fine because I have more important things to think about. Well, maybe you should try leaving him a message. He should at least know how you feel. Which is how exactly? That you have feelings for him. I don't have feelings for him. You can argue with me till your blue in the face, but I know you do. We're two sides of the same brain, remember? Plus, you look at him the same way I used to look at Dylan Hanson in the eighth grade, all googly-eyed and smiling. He makes you happy. Doesn't matter how he makes me feel; he's off to travel the world. That doesn't mean you can't make it work. I know he jokes around a lot, but Jaxon is a good guy, and he likes you, too, I can tell. You really going to throw all that away? I don't need a guy complicating my life. I need to focus on my studio. You can run a business and have a boyfriend, you know? I totally get that you need to make this place a success, but centring your world around a job is like going through life only wearing black and blue clothing. Don't you want some sparkle in your life? Give him a call. Hi, Jaxon, it's Rosie. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry for the other night. You were just trying to look out for me and I... got defensive. I really hope that you can forgive me, and I hope that you had a really good interview. My launch night's tonight, and it would be great if you could be here. I'd really love to see you. All right, well, that's all I have to say. Hopefully, see you later. Oh... There she is. Beautiful. Thank you so much. You look gorgeous. - Thank you! - Oh... Have a good night, okay? Is that Clark Kent I see over in the corner? Hi, Rosie. I've heard rumours that you're quite the romancer. Wow. From who? From Mel, of course. Oh, yeah. Listen, I never got a chance to say thank you for setting us up. She is everything I didn't know I needed. I'm so happy for you both. Oh! Oh... Sorry. I'll be back in a bit. Yeah. Hey! Here you go. Thank you. Wow. You look amazing. You look good, too. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hi, guys. Welcome. Is Jaxon with you guys? Sorry, Rosie. I left him a message, but he hasn't responded. Oh. Well, it's his loss, I guess. Oh, no, don't give up on him just yet. He'll come to his senses when he realizes just what he's missing out on. Thank you. Enjoy the party. Rosie, darling, oh, such a fabulous evening. Thank you, and thanks for bringing so many people. My pleasure. Remind me to introduce you to my very wealthy friend Greta-Lynne. She needs someone to help her find a range of outfits to wear on the red carpet at London Fashion Week. She's very. Oh. Well, look at this. Is this you? Yeah. My friend Jaxon took it. Oh, is he here? I wanted to thank him for the photos of Scarlett. No, he couldn't make it. Hey! You ready to give your speech? Congratulations. Thank you. As ready as I will ever be. Hello, everyone. Can I please have your attention? I would like to introduce you all to the woman of the hour, the most talented and fabulous stylist in Chicago who happens to be my best friend, Miss Rosie Pink. Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for coming out tonight. As most of you know, this studio is a dream come true for me. I wanted to be a personal stylist since I was eight years old. Ever since the days when I would dress up my best friend Mel in my mom's finest outfits and make her parade them down the street. I could not have gotten this place up and running without you. You're the best friend a girl could ask for... even when you argue when I say that red really does go with pink. My grandma Etta always told me that, if I worked hard enough, I could turn my passion for fashion into a career, and she was right. I would not be standing here if it wasn't for her love, support and encouragement, and for that, I will always be grateful. Yeah. So, that's pretty much all I have to say and... Actually... there's one more person that I need to thank. He's been there for me pretty much every day since I moved to the city. He's kept me grounded when I lost my way, and he's brought me lunch when I've forgotten to eat, and he's made me feel at home in a city where I could have very easily felt extremely lonely. He has been there for me many times, and when he needed me most, I let him down, and for that, I am really sorry. I hope he can forgive me. Um... Thank you, Rosie, for that fabulous speech. Everyone, please stick around, more drinks will be served soon. Um, actually... there's something I'd like to say, if that's okay. I know that Rosie is extremely grateful for everyone in this room who's helped her make this studio so amazing. But I also know that there's a lot of people in this room that want to thank you for everything that you've done to help them. Rosie might be a personal stylist, but she works tirelessly to help her clients find the best possible version of themselves, myself included. She's inspired me to take chances in my personal life and in my professional life. And she doesn't know this yet, but she helped me land my dream job. I don't know what the future holds, but I do know that there is one more chance that I'd really like to take. Whoo!
