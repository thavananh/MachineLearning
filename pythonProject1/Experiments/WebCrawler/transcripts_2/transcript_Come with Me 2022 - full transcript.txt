I’m sorry,... i am very sorry Inspector, I will drink it. I don’t know if you remember me from the hospital - I was the one who... - Madam, as you can see, we are having a good time. Nobody has time for you. So what do... ok,... my name is Tinu... Samira’s friend we spoke over the phone The talkative.. What can we do for you? I came here to clear this thing about Jason. Are you his alibi or what exactly? He was supposed to be out of the country. How do you know? You were not traveling with him, so... No, I was with Samira. Continue. I can hear you. So, there was this guy called Ben, he took Samira home - To his house? - No... to Samira’s house So she took him to her house right? Yes Sir...... What time? What time? About... i think 1am I guess I tried calling her and her number wasn't reachable. So I thought to check on her. Did Jason tell you that, he killed somebody and the body is inside his house? Did he tell you? Sorry? Sorry? I said, did Jason tell you that, he killed somebody, and the dead body is inside the house? He killed somebody, and the dead body is inside the house? Hold on! We went to the house, but didn't see any corpse there. Yeah. That can't be true because He was on the floor. He was right there on the kitchen floor. Samira can confirm this story Is Samira awake? Yes. So why didn't you say so since? Keeping us here and feeding us cock and bull story You think we have that much time to waste here with you? To waste here with you? You have no idea that even as we are here, we are now happy because, We were agitated, so we had to arrest Samira's brother because we are crossing our T's and dotting our I's We do not play around here Well, she's awake now! That is good... It is good right? Okay, let's get going once I'm done with this... Officer, let's go Sister, you would take an Uber because... Mr. Jason, we are sorry for the inconvenience. No. No. No. Don't be sorry. You had to cross your t's and dot's your I's. Please, what do we do about Ben? There's not much that can happen. But, at least we know his face. And we know he's MO. That's his motive of... police things Because ladies, usually, when things like this happen to young ladies like yourself they don't come out the same. Samira, you're lucky. She's lucky. No, no, no Madam. There's also the story with regards to the point of view of this... Ben... What I'm saying is, Is it a habit for you young women to go to a club at night, and pick up these men to your different houses? Sorry... I think what my partner here is trying to say is, we are interested in your occupation. You know. What's... Excuse me. What exactly are you insinuating, please? What are you... Mr. Jason, even you asking me these questions... In my report, you're traveling everywhere, going... What were you really carrying? I don't believe this. I understand how you ladies feel. But you must understand, the police is on top of the case. We'll handle this very thoroughly. Because we know that, with regards to this investigation, there's a missing puzzle in it Oh my God What if he comes back? That is not possible. Unless ofcourse he is your client Excuse you? He can't come back. He has fled. There's police everywhere. We've covered the whole streets. We've got the sniper. Plus, he thinks he is sensible. He put drugs inside the syringe. We found out. He wanted to make you weak. Easy prey. But as he didn't succeed, He will go and catch somebody else. I promise he will not get away. No, I promise he won't get away.

He seemed like such a nice guy. I told her. Don't stay in that house. She said, no she wanted to stay. I told her there are no neighbors and it was so lonely, she insisted. Look, selling the house is the best option. That's true. Right? Yes. But, how did he even get out of the house? Your friend. She just left the key, carelessly. Very careless lady. I saw the key there. That's another kidnapper, just roaming the streets like that. May God just help us. May He help us. Hello. How's my wonder woman doing today? Okay, you're good. You're good to go home But take it easy for the next few days, okay? You are not at a hundred percent yet. Thank you doctor. The nurse will bring her prescription. It's nothing serious. Just something to help you get some sleep. Doctor, I've slept enough already. I know. But not to worry just to help you to sleep and then help you get better. It will also help you with your anxiety.

Jason, can you put on AC? We're using the inverter. So it won't work. Oh, okay. Should we go to the room? No, I'm fine here. Don't you want to take it bath? At least come out of these clothes. We need to change all the locks and keys in this house. Yeah, I guess so. We need to change them now. You want me to go out now and get new locks? Yes please. Listen, you're not the only one that's been stressed today. Look at me, I'm still dressed in what I wore yesterday. I spent the whole day in the freaking cell. Samira, you really need to rest. Okay? Let me go get you some water to take your medications. I'm not taking that. Okay... Samira. Look at me Samira, you have to take it. Alright? The doctor said you have to and you will. That's the only way you're going to get better. Can you hear me? Please, get her the water. Okay. I know how this feels. It feels like everyone's against you and all that but, I know you don't like to take medications but you have to. Okay.? Thank you. Take some more. Take some more water. You'll be fine, don't worry. It's okay. Lie down. Sorry. I don't think there's any food in the house. So I have to go and get something for her to eat and of course you too... Okay, that's fine. I'd watch over her. And may be, clean up a bit. I appreciate you. It means a lot. It's the least I can do, We're like family now. Thank you. Thank you. Alright, take care of yourself... Please lock the door. Okay... alright. It's not your fault. It's all your fault! No, it is not... Tinu. Tinu. Tinu. Jason. You are supposed to still be asleep. Honestly, I can see why Ben decided to betray us. You would have been so worth it. Please. Please. Oh, be quiet. You already know what this is, so... Don't! Open the door. You're trapped, and the door is bullet proof. I know. I said, open the door. I guess I'll just make do with your friend. Loosing everything is bad for business. It's all up to you. Hello boss. Please come quickly, She has escaped. Okay, okay, okay, okay. If I come in, you're taking only me. Agreed? Yes. Forget kidnapping... I'll kill you myself, you bitch. Stop it. Stop it. Roy! Get off her. Get away! Get away from her. Are you okay? Are you okay? I think so. Are you sure. Oh my goodness. Jason, how did you know his name? You've got too much problems. You've got way too much problems. You had one job. One simple job. Go home with Ben! But, you stupidly brought him here. Of course there was that idiot. Fortunately I got there in time. And I would have finished you myself, if not for your pesky friend. Samira. Samira. Are you there? She's here. She's here. Why? Why? Are you that stupid? Are you that stupid? I need the money! My half sister is sitting on a house... that can easily cost 40 million, just because she wants to feel like she owns something. Your friends are married, and are in their husbands' house and you're here. You're here. Do you know the problems you cost me and him?? Do you know the problem you cost us? First, it was getting her together with Ben. She really likes movies and reading. Alright? Double 0 7, especially the ones with Pierce Bronsnan, all right? So, use that as an in, okay? Then it was getting you to fall in love with him But you messed that up again. You're always messing things up. Always messing things up. You messed it up. Then we had to improvise. Guy Why did you act this way? Roy please. Shut up. Don't plead with me. You brought this on yourself. You brought this on yourself. I don't have a choice. No. No. No. No. Roy, No Please. You are my hommie. Why did you do this kind of a thing. And you are aware that we really need this money. Guy, what kind of a thing have you done? The plan had to be perfect. No lose ends. No suspicions. We kidnap you, the police blames it on Ben, and we do the whole ransom and pay dance and then you die in the process. Q.E.D I did my research... Look, if you want somebody to disappear, all you have to do, is to kidnap them. Just kidnap them. Nobody will suspect. Not even the police will do anything about it. In this country, if you want to be successful, you have to sacrifice everything. Every single thing you have to sacrifice. From your humanity, to integrity, to your morals. You have to sacrifice every thing to be rich.. No wonder we're not from the same mother. And the only reason you believe this nonsense coming out of your mouth, is because you're a lazy man. Hey. Hey. Be careful! Be careful! You're just an entitled, vile, lazy little man. Relax. Relax. It's the inverter. Well don't act like you don't know what... Hey! Hey! Open this door! Open this door! You can't escape. I've locked the back door. Open this door Open this door I will blow your head off I will blow your own head off if you don't open this door Open this door! I will break this door down! Five, four, three, two, one. You should have been watching over her! I was watching over her. And she's inside. How is she inside when you were watching over her? How is she inside? How? Tell me! Come out. Come out of here! Are you deaf? Are you deaf? Who turned off the light? Wait, wait. Samira, please... Samira! Yes. I'm going to check on Tinu. Okay. Good afternoon, Miss Samira. How are you today? I'm sure you're good. On my way up here, I actually noticed this was the hospital my aunty gave birth to her first child. I remember when I used to come here and they used to serve this a peppered noodles on Sa... I just thought you'd want you to try the peppered noodles... So, hello. How are they treating you in the hospital? Okay. So I am here to let you know that the police is doing our best, to make sure that this is a closed case. Right? We're making sure that all the angles are covered. All the t's are crossed, and all the I's are dotted. We want to make sure you don't get to travel. So, you're here for questioning. I don't understand. I don't understand. What sort of questioning. Have you arrested Jason? About the Jason issue. We looked at Jason's statement and your statement, and after intensive comprehension, we found out that It's actually funny when... when when we found it out, that the two of you are suspects. What?!! My sister had nothing going for her, so she... planned this... this kidnap with her lover... Ben She’s dangerous,... she’s the criminal master mind What the hell are you saying Madam. It's past that one because Jason told us that, you are the main plotter in this whole thing. You are the mastermind. And Tinu can even stand as alibi for the report. So, it's beyond us... It's just my police duties So I'm just here to let you know that, the case is still on going and you need to be available for questioning. So, I've done my job. Isn't there an air conditioner in here any more? When I used to come here, there used to be an air conditioner So try and... Okay. Alright. Take care. Try that noodles on Saturday. Good evening. Hey, missy. Are you sure you don't want me to come with you? It's okay. I'm alright, okay? Yeah. Thank you. Alright, then. I love you. Love you too. Oh, yes. Forgot to give you this. Oh, wow! Haven't seen you in a while. Thank you. You're welcome. Please be safe, okay? I love you. I love you too. Take care of her please, sir. Bye. Bye. Excuse me ma. Should I start the trip? I hope you're ready? It's a simple run and grab. I understand sir. Samira really likes movies or reading okay? Especially Double 0 7, anything Pierce Brosnan. Yes sir. Alright. Roy will meet up with you after you leave Cielo lounge with her. He knows what to do with Samira. But sir. Yeah. Any problem? No. And you are aware that we really need this money. Guy, what kind of a thing have you done?
