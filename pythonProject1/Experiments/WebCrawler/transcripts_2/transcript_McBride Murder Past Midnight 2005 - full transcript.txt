Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Harriman. Who are you? Detective Hansen, LAPD. Will you come with me please? What happened? The paramedics got a call from the maid, at eight this morning that your husband was unconscious. What? They arrived at eight twenty and they transferred him to the Angels of Mercy hospital. Is he okay? He's in a coma. You didn't hear the paramedics arrive? No. I, I, I took a sedative last night. Why didn't Marta wake me up? Where is she? She's downstairs giving a statement. I don't understand? Mrs. Harriman. Why don't you get dressed. Big day, huh, Claire? How could you? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait, wait. We'll need statements from both of you. Detective? Detective. I am Elena Ashfield, Mr. Harriman's executive secretary. I came over as soon as I heard. - Detective? - Yes? Take her downstairs and get her statement. Right. Come with me. Ma'am. Well! What have you got? This was in the dishwasher. Cook here says all the dishes were done before he went home. When was that? Sometime after ten. When did he come on duty? About a half hour ago. I found it before he got here. It's consistent with the maid's story. Were you in the habit of taking your husband a glass of milk late at night? No. Then why did you on this occasion? He paged me on the intercom and asked me to. Why didn't he page the maid? He said she had gone to bed early and she wasn't feeling well. And he didn't want to disturb her. How long had you slept in separate bedrooms? Does it matter? I don't know. How long? I don't remember. Would you care to talk about it? It's personal and I'd rather not. Mrs. Harriman, you could help yourself if you were more forthcoming. I just don't think it is any of your business. That's all. All right then I guess this interview is over. She's all yours. Thanks Detective. Quite a spread huh? Yeah, you could say that. You have to put in a little money to fixing 'er up. But it will be a real honey when you are done. Huh, uh. How long have you been looking after the place Russell? Ever since Mr McNabb started having his legal problems. Yeah well. Good thing you weren't his ex-wife. Heh. Damn shame about that. I think he always figured you'd get him off. Two people you never lie to Russell. Your priest and your lawyer. He neglected to tell me, he actually killed his wife. Heh, heh. I gotta admit I envy you. I had my eye on this place for some time. Really? Want to buy it? Can't. Just bought a bunch of new farm equipment. McNabb gave me this place as my retainer. Now that he is making thirty cents a day at San Quentin. I am never going to my fees. So this lovely country home is now mine. It may not look like much at first, but it's got a lot of potential. Horse is real reliable. Yeah. You can never have enough glue huh. Russell, listen. Do you want to, uh, stay on here, take care of the place, same deal you had with McNabb? I'd be honored. Me too. So the first thing we do is, get all of this junk out of here. I mean everything out of the house except maybe the plumbing. Find a couple of repairmen. And a good painter. All right? Yes sir. Whose dog? He's yours. Comes with the property. Does it have a name? It's a he. His name is Jesse. He's a great dog. Oh good. Do you want him? No. I got six dogs already. All right. Jesse? Come on. Come on dog. Get in. Yeah. So where are you taking him? Doggie adoption. Roberta? Hi. - Hey Phil. What brings you this time? DUI? Stolen hubcaps? Shoplifting? Uh, actually it's kind of a big case. What do you mean? You mean the Harriman case? Yeah. I, I've actually never worked on anything as big as this before. And Leyton's prosecuting. Do you have any advice? Wear heavy shoes. Thanks. Mrs. Harriman? I'm Phil Newberry from the Public Defender's office. I've been assigned to represent you. Mrs. Harriman. I am just going to level with you. I. I've never tried anything nearly as big as this. You deserve the best representation you can get. So my advice to you is that, you hire yourself a defense attorney. Phil... That would take several thousand dollars. And I don't have several thousand dollars. I just assumed that, someone in your position would have substantial financial assets. I signed a prenuptial agreement before I was married. I get an allowance. What about other members of the family? Heh, they are not about to give me money. They want to see me get convicted. The prenup that you signed didn't prevent you from inheriting if your husband was incapacitated or deceased, did it? No. And that would be my motive, right? Uh, I'd say you could count on that. Yeah. Well, Phil. Looks like you got yourself a big case. Hola, qué pasa? Aquino más. Ah. Goodbye. Goodbye. Keep, keep, keep. Oh. What did I do? Court is back in session Mr. Newberry do you want to continue your voir dire? Yes your Honor, thank you. Mr. McBride. I can see from your uh, questionnaire here, You worked as, a police detective, you have friends who are police officers, and you currently work as a criminal defense attorney. And you know Mr. Leyton the Assistant District Attorney who represents the state in this case. - That's all true. And you've represented some high profile clients in murder cases. - That's also true. - And you've collected some substantial fees? You'd be surprised. Now in your experience as an attorney, would you say you have seen defendants lie? - All the time. - What about police officers? I've known a few who have been less than candid. And what about Mr. Leyton, do you think that uh, you will tend to agree with all of the things he'll say during trial? I'm afraid that Mr. Leyton and I tend to not agree on most things. The defense has no objection to juror number 232. How would you describe the relationship between your father and the defendant? It was a disaster. Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation. Sustained on the first ground. Were you familiar with the relationship between your father and the defendant, your stepmother? - Yes. - And how was it? It was a disaster. Could you offer us any particular examples of what you saw? You mean like when she moved into a separate bedroom, and had a deadbolt installed on the door? Exactly. No further questions. Mr. Newberry? No. No questions. Did the defendant ever express any particular attitude toward your father? Well, she told me she couldn't stand him. So. From the bed in your room, you had a clear view of Mr. Harriman's bedroom door. - Yes sir. - And the door to your bedroom was partly open, on March 15th? Yes sir. Could you tell us, about how wide? About two feet? Are you in the habit of leaving your door open at night? Well, in case Mr. Harriman has a problem. Well, why would he do that? Well, he has a heart condition. Objection your Honor. This calls for expert testimony. Sustained. Isn't it true that you are also a registered nurse? Recommended for your position by Mr. Harriman's personal physician. Isn't that true? Yes sir. On the night of March 15th, between the hours of eleven PM and one-thirty AM did you see anybody enter Mr. Harriman's bedroom? Only her. Indicating the defendant. Yes sir. Was she carrying anything? She was carrying a glass. It looked like milk. Nothing further. Miss Arnack, did you see anyone else enter the bedroom? No. So you were lying in your room in the dark, awake all that time. - No. So how can you be sure no one else entered the room as well? Well, there's this squeaky board outside his door. And it always wakes me up. I'm a light sleeper. And you're sure you saw the defendant in that darkened hallway? In the moonlight. Yes. Uh. Nothing further. This court stands in recess. We'll reconvene at one-thirty. Bailiff? Ah, that seemed to go nicely. You never know what a jury is going to do. Oh I'd say this one didn't much choice. Well, the three of us stand to get the estate if she is convicted. - What are you saying Emily? - It's just that's, she's not the only one that gets around. Too bad more people can't say that about you. - Who are you to tell that... - You are desperate... Ladies please, let's keep this one happy family. Come on. - Don't lecture me Tony. Russell, how's it going? Hey. Everything is fine out here Mac. Hey by the way... how'd it go at the animal shelter with Jesse? - Ah, fine. Cute dog. I'm sure they won't have any problem finding a home for him. Let's hope not. Although older dogs are harder to find homes for. What do you mean, he's not that old? You know what to. I think he is smart. Maybe I'll just keep checking with them, make sure they find a place for him. Talk to you later. - Okay Mac. Anytime. Sergeant Hansen I draw your attention to this evidence marked People's Exhibit J and ask you if you recognize it. Yes the evidence bag has my mark on it. Would you explain to the jury the significance of this glass? Apart from the milk residue, there is a high concentration of phenobarbital. Where was this glass found? In the dishwasher. And when was that? The morning that Mr. Harriman was taken to the hospital. Did you also find, this original prescription bottle of barbiturates? Yes. In Mr. Harriman's nightstand drawer. People's Exhibit K. No further questions. Sergeant Hansen, were there any identifying fingerprints on the glass? No. They were smudged. No further questions. Dr. Berman. You are Mr. Harriman's personal physician. Is that correct? Yes. For the last ten years. Have you the opportunity to test Mr. Harriman's blood for barbiturates? We ran a blood panel as soon as he was admitted to the hospital. Did you find any traces of barbiturates? There was an abnormally high level in his blood. Enough to cause Mr. Harriman's coma? It would be consistent with that, yes. Did anyone from the Harriman family recently call to order extra barbiturates for Mr. Harriman? Mrs. Harriman ordered an extra prescription of the barbiturate Phenobarbital ZM. When she ordered this extra prescription, Did Mrs. Harriman offer any explanation why they were refilling the prescription early? She said the other one had gotten lost. No further questions. Mr. Newberry? No, no your Honor. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Not guilty Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Okay. We have re-examined the evidence. And this is the third ballot. Now, no one is required... I'll simplify this for you. I am the holdout. I'm telling you this because I don't see any reason why you should stay here any longer. I am not going to change my mind. As far as I am concerned the Public Defender put up a pretty lame defense. How's that? How about the rest of the family? They stood to benefit didn't they? Why didn't he cross-examine them? We've come to a decision here. You. Have. Everything hinges on this maid having seen all of this in the middle of the night. Now eyewitnesses are notoriously unreliable. The Public Defender was right about one thing. The Prosecution, did not prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Madam Foreman, have you reached a verdict? No your Honor. We're hopelessly deadlocked. Ladies and gentlemen this court will now adjourn. - Thank you. - - I declare these proceedings as a mistrial. Mr. McBride? Yeah? I guess I have to admit I'm a big fan. So um, I'd just like to ask you if... I voted for acquittal. No thanks to you. Well, I would appreciate some constructive criticism if you??? Okay. Fine. First, you've got to put the victim on trial. If your client didn't do it, then who did? There have to be other people with a motive, which usually mean that the victim, was not such a sterling character. You have to keep pointing the jury to the fact that someone else could have done it. It's up to you to develop a counter-scenario that is plausible. And also don't refer to your client as the defendant. She has a name. She is a person. Use her name. You want the jury to think of her that way. Besides that, you left the prosecution off the hook up and down the line. Other than that, you did a great job though. Serves Leyton right for letting you on the jury. You know what? If he hadn't the other jurors might have wondered more about his case. He was betting his cards were strong enough. If the cops had done a better job, who knows, he might have won. You never know. Anybody ever tell you, you can be really, seriously difficult? Do you really mean that or is it just your way of suppressing pent up desires? Guess. I'll call you. Sure. I'd like to remind you that Claire Harriman, escaped conviction by one vote, one vote out of twelve. It is the intention of this department to retry this case as soon as possible. Because it is our firm belief that another twelve fair-minded people will vote for justice. Excuse me Mr. Leyton... - Thank you all. when do you think this will be retried sir. Mr. Leyton... Quite a moving speech. Not funny. - Lunch? - On you. Oh sure. I knew I shouldn't have let you on that jury. You wanted me on because you know I'm fair. Yeah. That was my theory. And you were right. Right? You really think she did it? You don't? I don't know. Hi. Hi. Where are the flowers? Nobody sent any. Not that he'd know if they did or didn't. The family, they check in on him? Just the wife. Calls in every day. Do I know you? My name is McBride. I'm an attorney. It seems like you need one. Sorry. But I can't afford you. Your case interests me. Yeah, me too. I was on your jury. I am the one, who voted for acquittal. I suppose I should thank you. I suppose you should. Thank you. You're welcome. Now what? Have a seat. A couple of questions. How did you meet him? I was a cocktail waitress up in Santa Barbara. He was there for the weekend. What do you do in the evenings when you are not working? He asked me out. I thought, why not, he's nice. Got some money. Love at first sight? Look, my family, which was from nowhere, were either dead or divorced and I didn't see much of a future for myself. In the beginning he was wonderful to me. I tried to be everything he wanted me to be. I read books. Learned how to dress. I just wanted him to be so proud of me. It was like I was a project to him. When he was done, he just, got bored of the results. Separate bedrooms? His idea. Slowly but surely, he just shut me out of everything. Why not just divorce him? I loved him. I really did. Didn't give up, and I kept trying I could win him back. I could never hurt him. Got any assets? Assets, like what? Art, jewels, cars? I have a couple of thousand in the bank. Um... Some jewelry in a safe deposit box. Yeah. I think the car is in my name. Make a list I am going to need it all. - What for? - I'm trying to get you bailed out of here. And between now and tomorrow morning, I want to make notes on anything and everything you can think about this family that can help your case. Particularly regarding their relationship with your husband. I'll get back to you tomorrow and try to get you out. Why are you doing this for me? I don't like to see anybody get railroaded. You don't want, anything else from me right? Hmm mmm. If I win. You get a bill. In the meantime let's just say I'm doing it for my karma. Oh, one rule. Don't lie to me. Ever. I won't. Then I'm on the case. Substitution of Attorney Your Honor. Are we ready to set a trail date? Your Honor, the People are fully prepared to try this case at your earliest convenience. - Mr. Mc Bride? - Yes Your Honor. Obviously I need some time for preparation, but a speedy trial does limit the prosecutions ability to try this case in the media. Is counsel for the defense suggesting that's what we're doing? Lordy no. I just think it's a good idea to remove the temptation where possible. The court appreciates your concerns. How is Wednesday the 26th? - Fine. - Works for me. Your Honor at this time also I'd like to reopen the issue of bail. This was settled before the first trial. People versus McNamara, the appeals court ruled that extended incarceration due to a hung jury and the People's desire for a retrial, makes the question of bail appropriate. Your Honor, my client has pledged to put up her few remaining assets in order to gain her freedom so she can help prepare her defense. And you have my word she is not a flight risk. I'll reduce bail from five hundred thousand to one hundred thousand. Thank you Your Honor. See you both on the 26th. Mr. McBride, Mr. Leyton... I just have one question... Hi guys, listen I'm not going to um, take any questions. But I do have a brief statement. As you may know, I sat on the first jury trial of Claire Harriman. I thought at that time she was innocent. So I not only voted for acquittal, so I also offered her my services to her as legal counsel. Now I am allowed, under the canon of ethics, to represent her. What I know about this case to date is all a matter of public record. And Mrs. Harriman is entitled to have anyone she chooses to represent her. And I am pleased she selected me. As I just want to see justice done. That's all for today. Thank you. Bye. So much for trying the case in media. Shhhh. I'm just trying to level the playing field. I think you've got a serious thing for this woman, or a professional death wish. Oh come on. I'm feeling lucky. How big a favor? I'm disappointed. You're always complaining about my lack of romantic gestures. I heard you took her case. Damsel in distress sort of thing. She's a little past her sell-by date to qualify as a damsel. Oh, oh come on. Don't take this personally. Anyway, I'm not here looking for a favor. Maybe not. But you will be. You know what you're turning into a cynic. Which doesn't become you. Are you okay? - McBride. Now a hundred thousand dollars bond means I need to put up ten thousand dollars right? - Right. - And I don't have ten thousand dollars. Not yet. We got to get Wingy his ten grand for bailing you out. In here let me do the talking. Let's see the box. Help yourself. I do believe that we can raise what we need with this. Anniversary present. Must have been a very good year. So why did you keep this in a safety deposit box and not at home. I was afraid that his charming daughter Emily would steal it. There was a couple of pieces already missing. Phyliss! Your lucky day. Well, look what the cat dragged in. I don't know McBride. Most people are just going to think this is costume jewelry. But you and I know that setting is antique. You go to the Jewelry Mart you'll get more than enough. He's a smooth talker isn't he? The smoothest. How much? I'll give you ten for the lot. C'mon do your soul some good. Twenty Five. - Fifteen. Twenty period. You know Harry's parole hearing is next month. You promise not to go and I'll make it fifty. Just give me the twenty. Wait here. So. Wingy got ten for your bail. Here is a thousand for you. The rest goes for expenses. You'll get an accounting. Unless of course I lose. in which case it won't matter. You always this reassuring? Now listen. From now until the trial I want you to stay put. You don't talk to anybody about anything except the weather. And avoid the press at all cost. Go to a movie if you get restless. But keep yourself inconspicuous. You've got my cell number if you need me. Oh uh. Here's the homework on the son, the daughter and the executive secretary. Good. Now can you think of anybody else, who'd want to go after him? There were people who could do without him but, no real grudges or anything to gain. What about Marta the maid? I don't know much about her. Any reason she would lie about seeing you? I don't know. Maybe she saw Emily or Elena. Or somebody. Okay. Time to go to work. Yes? No. No. I'm not interested. Telemarketers! Ug. I hope they pass that law. See ya. Freeze. Mmm. Uh. This is a really bad idea. Mmm. Seems pretty good to me. Oo you never change McBride I want to think you are here for me when it's most likely for the Harriman case. You know your problem Detective. What? You're such a cop. Then tell me I'm wrong. I didn't say you were wrong. I said you never think we could have it both ways. And you think you can. So. What do you want? - Well.. - On the Harriman case. All right. I want to see the interviews you did with the family members. You have got a lot of nerve. It's the nicest thing said you've said so far. You know I can't let you look at those files. Roberta, There is something wrong with this case. You're too good not to have sensed it. - No. - I need your help. No! Please ma'am. Please. I'm gonna get a cup of coffee. It should take about ten minutes. Thank you. I watched you during the trial. You couldn't take your eyes off her. Just doing my civic duty. Don't get yourself in too deep on this one McBride. Note. More flowers. Hi yeah. Animal Shelter. Yes. Hi. My name is McBride. Um, I brought a dog in. White dog. Named Jesse. Yeah, yeah, yeah that's the one. Have you found a home for him yet? Right. But you'll keep trying? Wait a minute. Hold on a second. What do you mean? How long before you put him... What? Well, I guess we are stuck with each other. I promise you I didn't know anything about the neutering stuff. I would have never taken you there to begin with if that had been the case. Could be worse. You could be a cat. You and I together? Yeah. We'll be fine. Need a hand? Oh Hi. Sorry for not knocking. Odd habit I have when I walk into my own office. Listen, I am sorry. But your door was unlocked. The super told me about your break-in so I went out, and got you this motion-detector. I can be a little slow I know. But last time I looked you were a Public Defender. I quit. This morning. And there's more to this story. Being a Public Defender is not why I became a lawyer. You've got this humongous case load, no resources. I mean witness the Harriman fiasco you were absolutely right about my defense. It was lame. So, it got me to thinking. I should do what you do. Stay focused. Don't spread myself to thin. Right. It is easy to do when you don't have a lot of clients. Um. What's your name again? Ah. Phil. Newberry. And I'll be finished up here in just a minute. The switch is right over here by the door. You just turn it on and, the alarm goes off with the slightest motion. That's great. Great. Turn it off. How much do I owe you? It's, ah It's on me. All you have to do. Is let me work for you. I am not exactly hiring right now. But you do need help with the Harriman defense. I already know the case. Look. I've... I've made a study of you. I've read a lot of your cases. You've got a lot to do with why I didn't go with a big firm. Maybe you should reconsider. I can hardly afford to pay myself. Okay. Money's not really an issue with me. I sort of have a... you know a... No I don't. a trust fund. Oh that's perfect. All right, grasshopper. How do you make a small fortune as a criminal defense attorney? Start with a large fortune? You're hired. Did I have the door open the right amount? Who are you? What... What are you doing in my room? Sorry. My name is McBride. I'm Claire Harriman's attorney. In your testimony, you said that the door, was open about two feet right? I'm sorry. I don't know if I should be talking to you. Well, here, court, it's really the same thing. You said about two feet. Is that correct? Um, yes. Uh huh. Would you mind, showing me how you were on the bed that night. Whether you know, on your back, on your side, however you were. I don't know... It will only take a minute I promise. Like this. Okay. Well, you could definitely have seen her. That's what I said. Bright night too. Now I checked the Almanac. Full moon that night. Yeah, that's right. The glass of milk she was carrying. Was it in her left hand or her right hand? Right. Right. Of course, she is right-handed. But then how would she have opened the door? I don't understand. It's simple. Follow me. She would naturally, put the glass in her left hand so she could open the door, but if she did that the glass would be on the other side of her body. Which means you couldn't have seen her. You're just trying to trick me. Marta. No. I am not. I just have to know exactly how everything happened. She probably had it in her right hand, and I just didn't think it was important. Okay. that's fine. Thanks for your time. I heard you were representing her. Who gave you permission to come in here? Well, until the court says otherwise, Claire Harriman still lives here. She asked me to pick up a few things for her. What have you been telling him? Nothing Mr. Tony. You're not trying to obstruct justice are you, Mr. Tony? - You're fired. And I don't want to hear you've been talking to anyone about this case. Do you understand me? Well, that's putting her in her place huh? Why don't you get what you came for. And get out. Good idea. Hello Mr. McBride. I've been expecting you. I'm Elena Ashfield. Hi. You know I was hoping I might, I assumed you'd be coming for her car. If you'd just sign this receipt. Very good. Wish you were on my side. Maybe I am. Anything else? Who is Lorenzo? Just a friend. What of it? Oh nothing I am sure. It's just that Claire said you and her husband had, her words, strenuous arguments about somebody named Lorenzo. I heard you the first time. You should at least be more discreet. You know what? I wouldn't worry about it. I don't think we should be loaning this Lorenzo money. He's not the kind of man I want to associate with, and I don't trust him. Well, you don't have to. You just have to trust me darling. Well... She must have been mistaken. Oh uh. Well. People hear things. Anyway thanks for the keys. Sorry, I couldn't be more help. Ah, maybe you'll get another chance. Just what are you looking for? Claire said there was a photograph of you and your father, in an album she wants. Anything else? How do you get along with your father? We've had our moments. He is my father. Any particular reason you haven't visited him in the hospital? The doctors keep me informed. He wouldn't know if I was there or not anyway. Okay. You're probably right about that huh. So, how was the bachelor party? What? In your statement to the police, you said you didn't come home that night, because you were at a bachelor party. Yes, so. Well, I talked to the bridegroom. And he said that you split around eleven. With one of the party girls you provided. Is that a crime? No, not at all you know what though, I talked to her. Um, Jennifer. She said, she passed out on her couch around eleven thirty. So she's a lousy date. And you didn't get home until the next morning. Hmm. So let me ask you Tony. If she passed out around eleven thirty, what were you doing there the rest of the night? Watching videos. I don't blame you. Your girlfriend passed out huh? So, You know a little something about drugs don't you Tony? See you in court. Roberta? - Hey. - Hi. I thought you quit the department. I did. Decided to go private. I wanted just to come by and say thank you for all the help you've given me recently. I really do appreciate it. Oh. I heard an ugly rumor that you are working with McBride. Yeah, he's great. Lincoln was great. Thoreau was great. Satchel Paige was great. We'll have to wait to see where history puts McBride. I thought you two were, you know, good friends. Well, that depends on what day you are talking about. Monday we're pals, by Wednesday we're going to Hawaii for a hot weekend, by Friday who knows where we are. Usually not Hawaii. Don't get me wrong. When he's good, he's good. Real good. What do you think you are doing? I'm representing Claire. These are my clothes. These are my clothes! Isn't this her room? Yeah, it was. Well, well. Not wasting any time huh? So you've been shopping your way through your grief? How is that any business of yours? Depends. It would interesting say, if you had more money, to spend now. Then you did before. You're old enough to earn your own money, Emily. You were never this selfish before she got here, Dad. Claire has nothing to do with this. Oh yeah, right. Like she's not poisoning you against all of us. Carl. Sit down honey. Do I have to beg? Emily, he needs to be left alone. Fine. You make me sound awful. Well it's just that, you never know, how a jury is going to interpret these things. What is that supposed to mean? It doesn't mean anything yet. So is there anything you can tell me about that night. I don't know anything. Did you hear Tony come in? Ah, I don't remember. - Did you see Elena? - I don't know. I don't know. I. Don't. Know. Okay, I was not feeling good. I went to bed early. Okay. Listen if you do remember anything, give me a call, would ya? Oh could you, where is Claire's stuff? I mean I'd hate to go back empty-handed. In a box. In the garage. If you want them. She said you were sweet. Wow. You really do have a trust fund don't you? Investing in our future. Where's Jesse? I left him back at the ranch with Russell. Do we really need all of this stuff? Welcome to the 22nd century here. State of the art and beyond. Huh, uh. Where's my typewriter? Ah it's in the closet. Whoa. No, no. I'm not giving up my typewriter. It's a relic. Check this out. It's a three chip video camera. with a memory card for photos. Doesn't get any better than that. You know what? This is going to come in handy. I want you to follow the daughter. Emily. Videotape anything suspicious. I've never actually tailed anybody before. I might need a little guidance. Don't get caught. Found these in the waste paper basket in her room. Receipts from an ATM. Same time everyday. - Hi Heather. How's Tim? - Much better, thanks. He's really responding to that antibiotic. - That's great. Did you get a chance to check on those calls on the cell number I gave you? Hmm mmm. There have only been three calls today. But all from the same number. 555-2676 The last one was thirty minutes ago. Great, thanks. I'll see you and Bart at the dog park. Okay. Love to Jesse. Bye. Bye, bye. What is that? Crisscross directory. I look up the number Heather gave me. It gives me the name and address. Who is Heather? Contact at the phone company. And that's all you need to know. I know. I miss you too. I promise. We'll be together soon. Okay? Yeah? Claire said to meet her here. No. You got that wrong. Well, why don't you set me straight. Ah, I don't know you. Hey! So who is the snake charmer in the trailer? Jeez. You always just barge in? I remember the room remember? And I told you never lie to me. I told you the truth I had nothing to do with what happened to Carl. You just neglected to tell me about the boyfriend at the trailer park. He has nothing to do with this. Lady. You're on trial for attempted murder. You leave him out of this. No. I'm sorry. Can't do that. Last chance. You level with me or you're on your own. All right. He's my brother. And he's been sick for a long time. Paranoid schizophrenic. That's not exactly a crime. Why the secrecy? - If Carl would have known, I would have been out of there. - It can be treated. Well yeah, if he takes his medication he can function normally. I found this on the floor of the bedroom. Pills were everywhere. - You went to his room? We had a little talk too until he got too agitated for my taste. You stressed him out. He can't handle it. - Where is he now? - Don't ask me. Where does he live? I put him in a private clinic. And you are selling off your jewelry to keep him there? I didn't know what else to do. Yes. This is Tom Manning's sister. Is Dr. Eastman there? I didn't think I had a choice. Dr. Eastman. Oh... he is there. Yes. He took himself off the medication. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be by tomorrow. Subject is approaching. Subject is just about to enter Third boutique of the day. Appears to be a modest purchase. Perhaps, Shoplifting maybe. She's heading into the plaza. Looks like towards the bank. And as predicted, her favorite ATM. Probably to withdraw a little bit of Daddy's cash. Perfect. Perfect. Walking. Sitting. Well, look who is here. So I need more this time than I thought. - What? - No, I just... It's not going to happen. I don't carry much more than I can handle. How could you say that? I'm not staying here another minute. Okay. I'll just go to anybody else. You gonna do that? You gonna go to somebody else? Then do that. No, no, no. Just wait. Hey. I got it. I got it. Just give me the money. Give me more... Please. All right. Relax. Who's that... Who is that with the camera? Excuse me ladies. - Ow! - Sorry. Watch out, sorry. Watch it man. What's up? Oh! Where's the tape? It's right here. What did you have to that for huh? Ahhhh, ahh. Stay here. Watch the car. You know something Vincent? I could really grow to dislike you. There's a tape in your mailbox. I want it. Well. Put the knife down first. Nah. Tape. You know something, your timing couldn't be worse. I've had a really lousy week. So. What's on the tape? What do you care? You're not a cop anymore. True. But you are still a crook huh. Must be something really interesting on there. Let me guess. Emily Harriman is a client of yours. And we have her on tape, making a buy from you. How long has she been a client? Don't push me McBride. Ah. Ah. Wow. It really works. Psst. Got a little surprise for you. What? Have you turned stalker? Can't this wait until morning? Oh. the elusive Vincent. Got a little movie here. Starring Vincent selling drugs. Hello Roberta. Nicest thing you've ever given me. Go ahead. Process him. Bye. Vincent. McBride. I need a little something else. - How little? - I've got a name. First name only. Lorenzo. Could be important to the case. And he might have something that's very embarrassing to the Harrimans. That's not very much. I know. But I need it. Soon. Ow. Good night McBride. I have a lot of work to do. Hi. Hi. Just wrapping up the software program so we can record every phone call that comes in here automatically. Did I get a call from Roberta? Yes. You did actually. Ah. She called in a name and address on some guy named Lorenzo Larson? Got it right here. Do me a favor, right it down. Be radical. Okay. - The Red Zone? - It's a club. She said it might be what you are looking for. You know what? I want you to check this guy out. And while you are there. Keep an eye out for Elena. Harriman's secretary. I remember her from the trial. Not much fun. - Still isn't. All right. I'll head over to the club right now. Phil. You know what? Maybe a better idea. Wait until tonight when there are people there. Okay. In the meantime, I want you to run a full workup on the maid. Marta Arnack. Marta Arnack. Got it. Yeah. I know, not much of a life huh Jesse. No time for ball today. I want you to know being a parent is difficult. I just hope you won't hold it against me. I see you got my message. Yeah. So ah. What's the emergency? Come on, come on. It's good therapy. I can't help him. Not for him. For you. Why haven't you visited him? Because, if it was the other way around, he probably wouldn't come see me either. Hospitals really creep me out. We have to talk because I think you know more about what happened that night than you are telling I am sorry. I can't really hear you from over here. Close enough? Has anybody ever told you that you are seriously cute I mean like in a mature kind of way. Beautiful skin. Help yourself. It would be a shame to mess that up with all those needle marks. Isn't it. Heroin? I would guess. That's Vincent's specialty. You know what? When you gave him the money, you should have burned the ATM receipts. That's how we found you. Get away from me. Vincent is in jail. All right. And if you are lucky. He's not going to drag you down with him. Let me go. Let me go. No, no, no. Give me my purse. Expensive habit isn't it. Who is giving you money? To stay quiet about that night? Tony or Elena? Huh? Who? Give me my purse. Stop it. Let her go! What's wrong with you? If you haven't bothered to notice, your step-daughter is a junkie. Emily? You'd better check her into rehab, or she is going to wind up in jail, all right? Which is coincidentally just where she's trying to put you. I'm sorry. Members only jack. How you doin? - How you doin? - Good. Hey, listen I... Hi there. Remember me? Well, well, well. Is it the boy defender? Are you lost? Listen I don't want to spoil your evening, so maybe you'd like to keep it light and tell me how much you paid the maid to lie about Claire. Now why would I want to pay her? I had no reason to harm Carl. If he discovered you were stepping out with Lorenzo here, that might spoil your fun. She has a lover. But it isn't me. If it is not him, then who is it? How 'bout me? Carl was never really into bikes. Look. I didn't want anything to happen to Carl. If he is not around, the party is over. Wouldn't want that now would we? I told you. Members only little man. This is a little unnecessary don't you think? I mean, I don't want to have to hurt anybody. Got no steaks. But this will do. If Elena was involved in this, it was for money, it wasn't for romance. Here. Keep it right there. So did you get a, address on Marta? Yeah. Right here. I hate these things. It took me years just to get used to voicemail. Do that. You sure this is the right address? Yes. - All right. Here. Just... - Ah, Okay. Okay. Keep the peas on your chin. I'll get you some aspirin. All right. Mr. Martinez. How long have you been employed as a groundskeeper at the Harriman estate? Little over twelve years. And in your time there, have you ever seen a halogen bulb like this? We have about eight of them. Are you familiar with the halogen bulb that hangs just outside the second floor bedroom window? Yes sir. If that halogen bulb were illuminated, would someone standing at the end of the hallway appear in silhouette? Objection, Your Honor, Speculation. Sustained. Nothing further. So you are absolutely certain, it was the defendant you saw that night. Yes sir. I'm sure. Even though you can't be sure, which hand was carrying the glass of milk, I saw the glass. but she could have changed hands. No further questions. Your Honor I have no questions at this time. But I request a short recess to confer with my client. Fifteen minutes. I want to testify. Miss Harriman. We have testimony that states that other than, Carl and Claire Harriman, and Marta Arnack that the house was empty that night. After ten PM. Is that accurate? No. It's not. What do you recollect of that evening? Ah well, I came home, around ten o'clock and, and there was a light on in the office. Don't think I don't know you are there. Staying up late. Cooking the books? Actually I'm about ready to leave. Shouldn't you be out getting drunk somewhere? Yeah, I should. But it's a slow night. Whatcha doin? After all I am a stockholder or whatever, What you are is very lucky, that your father doesn't know how much you spend. And on what. But he never will know. Right? Don't push me dear. Good night Emily. What time did you see her leave the house? Ah. I know it was after midnight, because she parks her car right underneath my window. And I saw her drive off. Did you see your father going upstairs to his bedroom that night? Yes. I did. Why aren't you in bed? Didn't meet anyone that interesting. That's not what I meant. Now you could see Claire's bedroom from there. Sure. I even saw her. I waited up. Take a sedative dear. It works for me. Then you went directly to your room? Actually, I was on my way... What stopped you? Shhhh. Quiet. - What? - You didn't see me, okay? - Why not? Because I was supposed to score this hot chick, and she flaked on me. I don't want any of the guys to know. You got it? - You are so lame. Whatever. Go to bed. No further questions. Miss Harriman. Um. How old are you? Twenty Four. And how long have you lived at home? All my life. Oh, you never went away to school? Yeah. I did. Briefly. Isn't it true Miss Harriman that you attended two universities, and you were dismissed from both of them? Objection. Relevance. I am going to demonstrate that this witness is not very reliable. Your Honor. If the state intends on impeaching this witness, because of her scholastic record, I would suggest that no court ever take testimony from several U.S. senators not to mention a couple of Presidents. - Overruled. But don't try the court's patience. I'll do my best Your Honor. So Miss Harriman. What can you tell us about why you were dismissed from these schools? I wasn't a very good student. Isn't it true after your last dismissal you enrolled in a drug rehab program? Objection. Irrelevant and prejudicial. Sustained. No further questions. How long ago were you at the rehabilitation center? - Three years ago. - And have you been in any programs since then? - No sir. - And did you enter that program voluntarily? Yes. I did. Thank you. Nothing further. Due to the hour, court will recess until nine o'clock tomorrow morning. That was very brave of you. Well. It couldn't hurt to do something decent. Every once in awhile. Just don't want to make a habit of it. I can help you, you know. I need to do this on my own. But um. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. How did we do? We made some progress. Great. I'll be at the hotel. Cirque de Soleil. Yeah, yeah. The trampoline is outside. That's all right. I think we scored some serious points. Yeah, maybe. We did put some things out there to think about. Shaky alibis, motives, casting doubt. What we don't have, is a clincher. Good, good. We can test out our new equipment. This is McBride. This is Marta Arnack. I need to speak to you. Okay. I'll meet you. Anywhere you like. There's no time for that, just no time. All right. You should know that I am recording this phone call. I don't care, I don't care. Fine, fine. What's wrong? She threatened me. To change my story. She's on her way to the hospital. I don't want to go to prison. I'm afraid of what she might do. You have to stop her. Stop who? Who threatened... Phil, make sure we got that call. Got it. Clear. One, two, three, four Clear. One, two, three, four Charging. Clear. Mark it. 9:17. Hospital called. They told me that he was dying. Mrs. Harriman. Preliminary autopsy report. Your husband showed a high level of potassium. Which in his condition was lethal. And there was a significant amount of potassium missing from the medicine room. You knew the location of the medicine room from your trips there, and you were the last person to see him alive. None of the nurses can corroborate your story that you were called to go to the hospital. Say nothing. The People are adding the charge of murder, to the case of The People versus Claire Harriman. The trail will continue tomorrow. Until then, Hrs. Harriman will be remanded to custody without bail. Court will resume at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. Hi. Hi. Um. What was the time of death again? 9:17. That's exact? Give or take a few seconds. Is there anything else I can do? Yes. As a matter of fact there is. Ready? Ready. Go. Got it! Thank you. She threatened me. To change my story. She is on her way to the hospital. I don't want to go to prison. What are we listening for? I don't know. Play it again. She threatened me. To change my story. Stop it. Is there a way that we can hear, just ah, what's in the background? I just want to hear the background. Miss Arnack. Were you at Saint Stevens Hospital, the day that Mr. Harriman died? No. I was not. But, you had been there on other occasions. When he was getting treatment for his coronary illness. - Yes? - And you have a background in nursing. - Yes. You testified earlier that that's one of the reasons, that you were initially hired. - That's correct. Do you know where the drugs are kept on Mr. Harriman's floor? Your Honor. Miss Arnack is not on trial here. Your Honor. Miss Arnack's testimony is central, to our defense, I would beg the court's indulgence. For the time being. Do you know where the drugs are located on that floor? Probably where they keep all the other medicine. Miss Arnack where were you when, you called me the afternoon Mr. Harriman was murdered. I was in my apartment. Are you sure? Asked and answered. Sustained. Just want to make absolutely sure. No more questions. Miss Arnack. What was the substance of your call? Your Honor. I happen to have a tape of that call made with Miss Arnack's knowledge and consent. And I would be happy to play it for the court. Mr. Leyton? I'm sure we would all be very interested in its content. This is McBride. This is Marta Arnack. I need to speak to you. Okay. I'll meet you. Anywhere you like. There's no time for that, just no time. All right. You should know that I am recording this phone call. I don't care, I don't care. Fine, fine. What's wrong? She threatened me. To change my story. She's on her way to the hospital. I don't want to go to prison. I'm afraid of what she might do. You have to stop her. Stop who? Hello? Who threatened... Miss Arnack. Is that a complete rendition of your conversation? Yes. It is. I believe the conversation is self-explanatory. I have no further questions. I call nurse Evelyn Wilson to the stand. Nurse Wilson was in the room when Mr. Harriman died. And she recorded the official time of death. Mrs. Wilson, is there a stairway near Mr. Harriman's room? Yes. How long would it take a person, someone in a hurry, to get from his room to the stairwell? About five seconds. And you know that because? Because you timed me while I made the run. Your Honor. Where is this going? Mr. McBride, I fail to see the connections here. Your Honor. My client's life is at stake. I would beg the court's indulgence a little longer. All right. I have no more questions of this witness. I have no questions. We call Dr. Reginald Berman. Just to re-establish sir, how long were you Mr. Harriman's physician? Ten years. I see. During that time, you probably had the opportunity to perform an EKG examination on Mr. Harriman yes? Yes. Doctor, would you explain to the jury exactly what an EKG does? It assesses any abnormalities, or lack thereof, by monitoring the patient's heart with electrodes. In other words you record the patient's heart rate, is that correct? Correct. Could you recognize Mr. Harriman's EKG if you heard it? - Yes. I think so. - How is that? He had a very distinctive arrhythmia. Arrhythmia? - Well, it's an irregular but distinctive heart beat. Thank you Doctor. No further questions. No questions. Recall Marta Arnack to the stand. Miss Arnack. The call you made to me the day, Carl Harriman died was made at 9:15 in the evening. Is that correct? Objection! Your Honor. Miss Arnack is not on trial here. I am almost finished with this witness Your Honor. I'll hold you to that Mr. McBride. I'd like you to listen to something. We had a sound lab separate your voice from the background noise on the phone call you made me. Dr. Berman is willing to testify, that's Carl Harriman's heartbeat. No. This isn't true. This is some of your lawyer tricks. I wasn't even there. - Yes. You were. You put the potassium in Carl Harriman's IV drip. No. I wouldn't do something like that. Yes, you did. And then you ran. Before you were discovered. No. You are wrong. Mr. Clark Parsons, would you stand please? Mr. Parson, works for the security department at the hospital. He saw you running. From the hospital. That night. You killed Carl Harriman. Would you care to admit it? I want to talk to an attorney. Oh! No more questions. Mr. Foreman, have you reached a verdict. We have Your Honor. How say you? We find the defendant, Not guilty. Ladies and gentleman. That concludes these proceedings. Court is adjourned. How do I thank you? I'll think of something. Well. congratulations. You know what it is not all bad news. You've got a slam dunk trying Marta Arnack and if you squeeze her just right, she'll give you her partner, Tony Harriman. Well, look at you. Setting a precedent? Just a celebratory dinner. Ah. Let me guess with whom. Can't figure that one out? You're fired. Pay me first, before you can fire me. Yeah, well. Don't be such a lawyer. Ah I found that under the door. I recognize the scent. Bad news? No. Not entirely. There's a check in here for services rendered. Which means I can pay you. And fire you. She's also standing me up for dinner tonight. Going back to Pittsburgh with her brother. Put him in a clinic there. Going to be gone the whole weekend. But she'll call me. Where have I heard that before? - Hmm. Probably you. - Mmm. Ready? For what? I'm taking you to dinner. Wait. Did I miss something? No. I've just been thinking about how much I owe you, for all you help on the Harriman case. And I thought I'd take you out to dinner. What happened? Your client cancelled? Ouch. I love it when you are sarcastic. Well then you can have all night to think about it. I've got plans. See ya. Yeah. Well... Although, in case I didn't mention it, you did a terrific job on this case. Well, you didn't mention it. And thank you very much. And since, we have a little money heading towards the bank, I thought that I would spring for a lavish dinner. Huh? Aw. You know that would be great. I've. I sort of have plans. I appreciate it. Sure. I'll see you tomorrow? Tomorrow. Okay. Good night. Good night. You know what? If you've got other plans, I'm going to have to reconsider this entire relationship. Ah!
