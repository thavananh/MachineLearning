I had a treasured and very expensive possession. Ten years before my death I had hidden that treasure.. With great care in a secret room of this Dhumro palace. I had also written down the code that would help.. My successors get the hidden treasure. Alas! Five years before my death I was afflicted by a strange disease. I lost 73.5% of my memory. I tried hard to remember the code and the place where.. I hid the treasure but I failed. Therefore, even after so many years of my death.. The treasure is still out of sight. Dhumro palace is in ruins now. My useless grandsons are still living here with the hope.. Of getting the secret treasure of Dhumro palace. Hurry up. hurry up, baba (dad). Daba (chess)? Is this the time to play chess? My eldest grandson is deaf since birth. Keerti Kalap. One night at around 3 am I suddenly got back.. My lost memory for a moment. I don't know why so many years after my death.. I appeared in Keerti's dreams and gave him a clue to the hidden treasure. Agra's Bhuto. Come. Come quickly. Come. My granddad Dhumro appeared in my dreams. If two boys named Bhuto from Agra come here as tenants.. Then he'll find the hidden treasure. Make an announcement. Room at very low rent with free mutton on Sundays. I don't know what he heard. Several useless guys named Bhuto crowded to my Dhumro palace. Bhuto.. - Guto (push). Where were you pushed? - Agra. I'm Bhuto from Agra. You can finish off an entire goat. Agra's Bhuto. - Just an excuse to stay here free of cost. Bhuto.. from Agra. - Agra or Niagara, brother? I appeared before all of them once and it worked. Don't run away, they won't harm you. They're homely spirits. - There's ghost here. They won't harm you. What do you mean? They'll kill me. My late aunt and my steward Pochke Pochu. Appeared before one of them. What about a game, brother? One or Six.. Only one tenant, an expert treasure hunter.. John Brown was the one who didn't leave. He was the successor of my tenant the notorious painter Peterson. Before his death his grandpa had told his grandson about.. The hidden treasure in Dhumro palace. Rai Bahadur Dhumrokalap. Bengal's Rai Bahadur Dhumrokalap.. Earned a lot by running Indian ships. He had a painter whose name was William Peterson. He mysteriously went missing from home one day. Our great, great grandfather. I appeared in the dream of my deaf grandson. But even after that I couldn't go to heaven by leaving.. My poor grandchildren alone. I stayed back. These poor fellows search the hidden treasure throughout the day. I too start searching the treasure at 8:22 pm every night. Dad.. 8:22! Everything is false. Bhombol, the mad fellow.. He would give foot massages to Belun Bala.. The daughter of my only paternal aunt Hatu pisima (paternal aunt). On her death bed Belun bala had shared the clue to.. Get the hidden treasure to Bhombol. 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' Hey you! Mad fellow! On a dark night uncle was returning home with fish.. And was passing under a wood apple tree. Like father, like son. If you fail again, I'll throw you out of the house. You won't get shelter even at your maternal uncle's place. My second eldest grandson is weak and ailing since birth. Kriya Kalap. - What happened? I feel like puking. - You do it daily. Did you find anything? He failed five times in class ten and yet couldn't pass. Elder brother has got a code. - Code? - Code! 'Bipod' missed the target.' 'Double edition of the opposite of 'ajuto'.' This is a coat. Whose coat? The dead Englishman's? Come on, mom. It's not coat. It's code. A clue. She hails from a village so her English is a bit weak.. My third grandson Krishna Kalap was a school dropout.. But he was very smart. Code for what? - ..of the hidden treasure? "My dear, please don't leave me and go." The smartest among them was my youngest grandson Keka Kalap. He was studying medicine when he suddenly lost his mental balance. Magic solution! I'll give it to the ghosts. Their lost memory will become sharp. Shut up! So, you want to bring back the lost memory of the ghost, Chandra Roy? Chandra Roy.. Who is he? - Bidhan Chandra Roy. - Okay. Give me the solution, this illusion is not working. "Even if the price of alcohol increases in Bengal I won't stop drinking." "My heart is restless." "I'm off on a journey, my friends." Auto! One who should be respected has been splashed with muddy water. Scoundrel! Oh no! My mobile is completely wet. Pushpa.. - Sorry. - It's okay. Such troublesome weather. Isn't it? My mobile? "One day I'll be rich." Darkness descended everywhere. Amidst the darkness something appeared before me. I kept walking over its breasts. The censor will have objections to it. Okay. Change it to stomach. Continue. The famous theatre personality is finally here. What's the time? 12:30.. Oh! You've already started. I'll start. Today I hear the cries of owls and vultures.. And then enters Bhima with his mace. - Shut up! Dialogue! Go and get tea. He doesn't know who he is talking to. I act and I attend plays at Nandan. Do you think we should worship you for that? Out! Sir.. sir.. shall I? They made Shakespeare work in a stable... they didn't allow Amitabh Bachchan to work in radio.. And now they're sending me to get tea. Come on start.. where's Draupadi's daari (beard)? No.. it's a sari. You can't stop me like this. You think you're a great playwright. What did you say, scoundrel? You can't stop me. Let me become rich and then I'll organize theatre festivals. I'll make all the directors do petty jobs. Scoundrels! One day when I went to watch the theatre of the present times.. I discovered this talented fellow. At the very first sight I felt that he would be useful to me. Who is he? I don't know why I'm scared of ghosts tonight. I don't know why in this dark night.. Oh god! But, there's a problem. He's very scared of ghosts. Today thousands of vultures.. At the sound of the footsteps of the evil.. Oh no! Who is it? Who is it? Who is coming? who is coming? It's me. The landlord! It's been nine months. - Congrats! Take care of your health.. I didn't know about the good news. I'll slap you hard. Pay me the rent. I owe you the rent of nine months. Who will give me the rent? Who? - I'll. You keep the lights switched on throughout the night.. And enact your scenes and learn dialogues.. Sishir Bhaduri (Bengali playwright).. This is my underwear. This is my vest. This is my toothbrush. Poga! - Who is calling me? This old man.. your father. Yes, tell me, dad. - I'm so unfortunate. Scoundrel! If I see your face tomorrow then I'll break it. - Yes. This is the final waning. My charger. I was not getting it for the last four days. Thief. - No.. He's petty thief.. - No. - A robber. - No. I'm not a thief. I've a disease. I'm kleptomaniac. My hands can't be controlled just like bowels. Did you hear him? He's a rogue. He'll steal you someday. - No.. no.. I don't take the things that I can't lift with my hands. He's extra large.. I won't be able to lift him. I'll slap you hard. I'll slap you so badly that you'll contact AIDS in ears. - Yes. Leave the house or I'll cut it. And after that you won't be able to father a child. You always get the wrong meaning, dad. I was taking about disconnecting the electricity line. I'll disconnect the main power line. Brother, please don't disconnect the power line. I'll take him to Dhumro Palace now. Cunning Kalicharan. - No! He works as a promoter full time and.. Is a part-time jatra (folk theatre) actor. He's the super star Kalikanta of Bengali jatra. Rajnikanth. He lent one and half lakh rupees to Krishnakalpa.. So that he could get hold of the hidden treasure. I'm tired.. do you want idli or vada? Get back to Bengali. - Yes, I also suggest so. It'll be good. - I'll make you feel good. Where's the will? Agra's Bhuto will definitely get it. How will he get it? Will he count hands or smell legs? Stupid fellow! A whole neighborhood claims that they're Bhuto from Agra.. And they want the treasure. - Hidden treasure. - How? With Ballon Bala's clue. - Balloon? Before her death she smiled and whispered the clue to Bhombol. Don't try to fool me in the name of clue. No. No! I want the document. Make a fake one. Get the signatures of all the four brothers. That'll be a tough task. Pressurize them. - Huh? - Pressurize. And then leave the house and go. Scoundrel.. you spent one and half lakh rupees after liquor. Sir, you spend so much money just like that? My case is different. No one can stop Kalicharan. Is there any ghost around? - No. Shall I go? - Of course. The path is clear. - Thank god. Oh lord! Oh lord! Oh! The third son of my great grandson. He's a storehouse of diseases. Read this.. Rabindranath Tagore gave up his knighthood. How will that make any difference? Pochu.. - Yes. Get opium and milk in a big bowl for me. - I'll get it. "Bipod' missed its target.' 'Double edition of the opposite of 'ajuto'.' Why don't you get the walls painted? Yes? I live inside the walls. What if I fall sick? I work so hard. He gave me this and ordered me to get a theatre group here.. From Bagh Bazar for Lord Curzon. Surgeon? Why? What happened? He's deaf. He can't even hear what the ghost is saying. China? Why? - This is impossible. A ghost can't even talk to his human counterpart for some time. Oh no! It' s time for the daily soap 'Maa'. If master asks about me tell him that I'm watching the soap.. From the cornice of the house next door. Okay? Did anything happen? - I can puke. Everything will be ruined. What an ugly house! The left leg is on right today. - Don't look at her.. She'll change the leg now. Did Kalicharan say something? Brother, please sell the house. I can't handle him anymore. I want my share as I want to start a business. That's all. Listen to me.. - No.. - You can puke. Please listen.. It's not coming out. Listen to me. Then try to vomit by putting your fingers inside your throat. You want me to put my fingers in my throat? You don't have to take the trouble. Kalicharan will come and do it. Why did you borrow money from him? What other option did I have? We had to pay the tax and maintenance of past fifty years. We've no money to meet all the expenses. I thought that I would pay back after getting the loan. Nothing is going to happen. - I'm going to puke. That's nothing new. Did you have your medicine in the morning? - I forgot. - Great! So, you forgot? Let me warn you. Get ready. We'll break the house and build an apartment here. You'll get a flat and so will I. Okay? This is a haunted house. Only ghosts will come out of it. He's going to kill me. Help! He's going to kill me. Help! Help! Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother.. don't be scared. Don't be scared. What happened after that, Pochu? You've forgotten everything, master. Yes, I've forgotten. Master, you're shedding tears. Wipe them. I've just wiped them. what difference does it make? Look at them. - Brother.. no! They're my successors. They're busy fighting. They don't even have enough to eat. What about the treasure? - Scoundrel! It's hidden.. hidden treasure. But I can't recall where I kept the hidden treasure. I told Keerti about it but he didn't hear me properly. To hell with the deaf fellow! Tell him once again. I don't remember it. Algebra. - Alzheimer. Whatever.. I don't remember. Times have changed. Nothing is permanent. I don't remember anything. What would have happened if we were in earlier times? - What? "Kolkata in the past was full of party and gatherings." "Bongs would digest mutton so easily in those days." "Kolkata in the past was full of party and gatherings." "Bongs would digest mutton so easily in those days." "I would get my cats married and visit hills in my car." "When the Englishmen were here we would weigh and take gold coins." "Those were the days, Bhomra." "Those were the days." "Those were the days, Bhomra." "Those were the days." "Those were the days, Madan." "Those were great days." "Those were the days, Bhokata." "Those were great days." "Those were great days." Times have changed. Those were the times of enjoyment and pleasures.. But now they study physical science. Hurrah! "We enjoy day and night and sing at midnight." "We enjoy delicacies like fish fry with mustard sauce." "Those olden days were colorful." "Those olden days were colorful." "Were colorful.." "Were colorful.." "People would wake up in the afternoon dressed in loincloth." "Look at the present." "These are useless times." "Look at the present." "These are worthless times." In the mat laid for us.. Gauri.. my only great granddaughter. Very good. She's getting old for marriage. I'm planning to get Gauri married to that fat chubby fellow. Drink this. Does the word 'basanta' (pox) have any connection to small pox? I don't know. Drink the tea first and then trouble your family members.. Throughout the day. I'll start digging out every place in the house with a spade tomorrow. I'll stoop so low that people will address me as licentious. Brother-in-law, get a rope and pot for me with the spade. Okay? That's a great idea. You'll go deep inside with the help of the rope.. And get the hidden treasure out in the pot for me. Nonsense! Go deep! Don't go deep.. go to the asylum. We can't keep you in this house anymore. But, I'm not completely mad yet. I'll be completely mad when the summers arrive. "Go deeper.." Shut up, scoundrel. Take bath and tie your hair. You don't have to work for this family. Mom, did dad find any clue about the hidden treasure? It's all nonsense. The money-lender is going to come.. So he's hiding under the bed. We're dependent on Agra's Bhuto and the rent given by Anne. We don't get tenants for the first floor as it's haunted. How can we continue like this? We're selling off all the expensive things one by one. 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' I would've left this house if I got you married. What are you saying, mom? We've been able to survive amidst all the problems.. As we were always together. The unity won't last long. Fish is being secretly sneaked in the kitchen. We're surviving on humble pumpkin. What are you taunting me? - Who else should I talk about money? Why are you talking about fish? Who are you trying to hint at? I smelt fried fish at midnight. Someone was frying fish. Who ate the fish? The ghost? The rent is nominal. Is the place haunted? - Yes.. No.. We're four brothers who live there. We've two tenants on the ground floor. - Oh! Where will you find ghosts in a busy city like Kolkata. What are you saying? How can so many people stay in this city? Half of them are ghosts. Wherever I look.. The dentures are very old. I'm planning to get new ones. What happened? I mistook him for my great grandfather. - Oh! Our house is 200 years old. Even the ghosts there have died. Oh lord! Do you've expensive things in the house? What do you mean? - What would the thief steal if there is nothing? I'm where there is no ghost. Are you a supporter of Mohanbagan football team? - What are you saying? Is it? - Yes. - What's his name? Well he played in the left forward in the 60s.. Come on, tell me his name.. - Forget it. Don't talk to the neighbors. - Why? They'll say that my house is haunted. What are you saying? They're cunning and mean-minded. All supporters of East Bengal. When? - Tomorrow. I'll allot his room to you. - Whose room? No.. I mean.. you're going to be the first tenant.. To be allotted a room in the first floor. You're brave, courageous, one who isn't scared of death. You'll display your victory flag on the first floor. What a great feeling! As if I'm going to climb Mt. Everest. Meet you tomorrow. Bye. Calm down. What happened? We've a new tenant. Tenant! He's a brave lad. - A boy? Is he from Agra? I'm not sure about that. After much difficulty I convinced him. But if he sees all of you fighting like this he may go away.. We won't fight anymore. I don't have many questions, just one question. What is it? Does he know that I reside here? Even the governor knows that you reside here. Who else do you want to inform, wretched fellow? Okay. I'll inform the police about the date.. When I'll completely become mad. - Yes. Won't be able to relax until I sell the house to Kali. Empty! My pockets are empty. There's money. - With whom? Hidden treasure. - How long will it remain hidden? For five years I kept you and your sister as spies in the house. You bragged that you've foreign blood in your body.. And you'll definitely find the treasure. We decided to share the treasure equally, treasure hunter. Hidden treasure hunter. Hidden treasure hunter, I've been bearing your and your sister's.. Expenses for so many years.. But where is the money? Where's the treasure? I've got the code. - Have you? I'm waiting to de-code it. A new tenant is coming. He'll stay in the first floor. He's a fatty cubby Bhuto. We've to get hold of the document or.. If someone else de-codes it before us we'll get nothing. I'll arrange something. I'll talk to Kishan. We'll create so much problem tomorrow morning that.. They'll be forced to take out the document. Oh no! Power cut. - Oh no! I can't see anything because of the power cut. There's power cut in every room.. But lights brighten up my room. "Bipod' missed its target.' No one other than experienced detectives can break this code. I'm definite that your dad can't de-code it. My inventions will become immortal.. As the ghost will get back their lost memory. Oh god! It's 7 pm. Tunka, give me the while shawl. - Yes. I'll also come along. Shut up! You'll be in trouble if the ghosts get hold of you. Scoundrel! Useless fellows! Listen to me. The chubby tenant who is coming tomorrow is the one.. Who can help you recover the hidden treasure. Fat chubby talented tenant. Slow down. Stop here. Brother.. brother.. why are there so many people named Bhuto here? Everyone here is Bhuto.

Thousands of owls and weird vultures.. Jatra.. group theatre. I feel relived now. This house is haunted. Six ghosts had thrown me down. Who are you? - So you speak Hindi? - Hmm..

He's telling his character's name. Excuse me.. is this original? - hey! It's original. Everything is mine. - Is it? Do you think it belongs to your father? Don't take my father's name. You look familiar. Where did I see you? Rang Manch theatre or bioscope. Rang Manch theatre. Bioscope. - Yes. You're very handsome. You look like Hopkins. Fair complexion and everything. Come on, let's rehearse together. I'm fed up of these ghosts. Let's rehearse. We'll keep our culture alive. Where do you stay? Here? This is my room. They didn't tell me that I'll have a room-mate. Oh! Okay. I'm ready to stay with you as you're a good actor. Okay? Let's go. Why are you not wearing shoes? You can't roam around bare-footed in this house? If anything pricks your feet you'll be dead. I've already died once so no chance of dying again. Forget it. Let's go and rehearse. Come. Where am I? Where am I? Master, he's regaining his consciousness. Don't faint. Don't faint. Just because I'm fat and chubby you want to kill me? - No.. We've peeped inside your brain and seen that you're smart. You can find the hidden treasure. Listen.. the IQ of my grandchildren is zero. All of them are stupid. Generation gap. - He's right. Listen.. if you're your father's son. Take this paper. Find the hidden treasure. Let me see how smart you are. You want to see how smart I am? Vanish? Is this magic? Stupid, that's a ghost's sword. - It's Bhutoyal (ghost's sword). I won't stay here. I won't. He always loses his sense. Nonsense. I won't stay here. - Don't go. It's nothing. They're cosmic beings. Shut up! cosmic beings? It's a haunted house. - Haunted? No. They were suffering. Everything is stable now. - Stable? You're making some mistake. - Please don't say that. Listen to me. - I'm speaking the truth. It's an old house so the old memories have become a part of present. Part of present? I know the truth. All of you lied to me. I'll go. - No.. please. Don't talk nonsense. Don't lie. Please shut up. Let me warn you. What do you want to tell me? - Stop it!

I'll go back to my native place. - Impossible. I'm sure that you're the original Bhuto from Agra.. Or you wouldn't have been alive after spending a night.. On the haunted first floor. You'll solve the code. I'll take it from you and then you'll be free. Back. Back. No.. no.. please don't say that. You're a nice boy. Why did I come here? Nothing will happen. Everything will be fine. - No.. Will you please shut up? I would prefer to get killed by gunshot. He's running away. You're like my mother. Will you please accompany me to the gate? Yes, I'm like your mother. Please come with me. - Nothing will happen to you. Nothing will happen. - I can't stay here. - Debashish.. Bhuto, listen to me. There are no ghosts here. - There are ghosts. There are no ghosts. - There are ghosts. There are no ghosts, I assure you. There are other thrilling things in life. - Romantic things. "If my beloved showers her love on me.." You didn't understand anything. Come with me. Will they do naughty things now? - No. Night is not meant for ghost.. Night means a lot. Life is not just about science.. It also includes emotions of life.. It's a game of hormones.. music of Sachin Dev Burman. "The bride didn't give her love to me." "She just stole my heart." What shall I live with, Bhuto? There's no ghost. - No ghost? There's no ghost. - No ghost? There's no ghost. - No ghost? "I've spent many sleepless nights alone waiting for a special night." "The desires aroused feelings of love." "My love for you." "Why did we get late?" "We got late." "You're my love." "You're my sweetheart. - Is it?" "I'll adorn you with the garland of my love." "that's what I know." "I'm your love." "I'm your sweetheart. - Is it?" "I'll adorn you with the garland of my love." "that's what I know." "I light the lamps of love in my heart." "You're my lost melody.. the music of love." "I light the lamps of love in my heart." "You're my lost melody.. the music of love." Sing with me. "I've spent many sleepless nights alone waiting for a special night." "The desires aroused feelings of love." "My love for you." "Bipod' missed its target.' Lovely! Lovely! 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' 'Double edition of the opposite of 'ajuto'.' Delicate! - Delicate! What if I recite nonsensical lines? Literature can't explain everything. You don't have a future. - Yes. there is. Even ghosts have a future. 'Bhuter Bhabisyat' the film.. Didn't you see it? Son, since I wrote it there must be some meaning. The first word means.. there's no danger. Where is a place without danger, uncle? There's a danger in every step. This is not my granny's place. There's danger at every step. What happened, son? I think it runs in your blood to enter and exit silently. Can't you knock before coming in? What if they knock me down if I knock and come in? Danger.. could you decode the meaning? - Not yet. - Okay. If you need any help just tell me. - Of course I will. After all you're an intelligent detective's father. No.. uncle.. - Whose? - Gauri's. She's my niece. Would you like to have a drink? - No. My mother told me not to drink Okay. If Gauri is my niece then you're my would be.. Stupid fellow! They want to emotionally blackmail me to get the hidden treasure. If I get the hidden treasure then I'll sacrifice.. A pair of goats to you, Goddess. A pair of goats. Double.. means two.. A pair means two. Double edition.. Gauri! Books.. books..- Books.. 'Double edition of the opposite of 'ajuto'.' Only a book has two editions. Come on find it. - Books.. Two copies. I've found it. - What? The easy method to expand the family. Two copies. Two copies of 'The easy method to expand family'. Eureka. Hidden treasure What's this? Can anyone expand family by reading books? It isn't possible. Right? No. It isn't possible. Right? Debasish! Don't shout so loudly. It's an old house and can collapse. It can collapse. - It can break down. Call softly. Debasish. How fare have you progressed in de-coding the clue? Repeat after me. Debashish.. Who is it? He has arrived. He's Knight Rider and he's the dare devil from Agra. - Yes. I think I'll vomit today. - I'll be relieved if that happens. Bhuto from Agra, have you decoded the clue to the hidden treasure? Come on tell me. Take out the hidden treasure. Sir, the hidden treasure is mine. - What? It's ours. So, we'll get it. Repeat after me.. the hidden treasure.. - Is ours. Who are you? - Who are you? Do you want to see who I am? Do you? A great thud and Kalicharan exits. He has fainted. He has suffered an internal hemorrhage. Take him away. - Come on. We'll land up on the streets if we don't get the treasure. We'll be ruined. I suggest that you sell the house. There's no hidden treasure here. You want to sell off your ancestral home? You want to sell your residence? Or we'll have to beg with a bowl on the streets.. let me warn you. We'll do so. Who died? Somebody we know? - Shut up! You're deaf. You always hear wrong things. Why do you always fight? What will I do your blood pressure shoots up? What will you do? Kalicharan will come again. The cudgel (mugur) won't fall on his head every time. I haven't eat it for many days. - What? - Magur fish. I haven't eaten it for a long time. Many years ago after Indira Gandhi left I had high fever. I lay unconscious for many days. You applied wet cloth strips on my head. The fever went down after five days. My condition as critical. Keshta, do you remember that you brought a big magur fish from the market? Your wife cooked it. It was delicious. I still remember the taste. When I hear the name of magur fish, I recall that day. That was the last time we staged a play in Dhumro palace. Alamgir. Damini played Jahanara and brother played the role of Aurangzeb. The actor from the Mallick family came to watch the play. He praised brother's acting. After the play got over we feasted on fine rice, prawn curry, tender mutton.. the entire neighborhood was invited. That was the last year of celebration. Even then the hidden treasure was there. It was there in its place. We brothers were happy in each other's company. We never tried to find it. Now we're secretly looking for the hidden treasure. "Why couldn't I express my feelings?" "Why couldn't I express my feelings?" "I couldn't explain my pain." "Why couldn't I express my feelings?" "He came and went away happily." "He doesn't even look back." "He ignores my desires and feelings." "Why couldn't I express my feelings?" We feasted on delicacies. Those were the days. There were elephants and horses in the stables. But, now Bongs are useless. Stop rhyming. Your memory has gone for a toss. You contracted such a disease that you couldn't find your own treasure. What was that disease called? Alzhamaka (Alzheimer's). Algebra. - It's the same. That chubby fellow is the only one who can help us out. What are you saying, aunt? That fat fellow was planning to share the treasure with others. I peeped inside him and saw clearly that he has a dirty mind. I'll exile him to Afghanistan. - Shut up. Don't brag. You would wet your bed even after growing up. When your mother would scold you.. You would come to me for solace. Listen.. listen to me carefully. Only that chubby fellow can do it. You must try to bring him under your control. Keep it on your knee and chant the mantra of power. Let me see the past of the present. Om… Om… Om… If you're not greedy then it'll kill your enemy. If you're greedy it'll kill you. Let's go ahead. Traveler, have you lost your way? I'm looking for the right path. It's not so funny. - I know it spurts out water. Who is she? Vamp? My sister Annie. William Peterson, my late great, great, grandfather. The hidden treasure is mine. I'm Bhuto from Agra. I'm also Bhuto from Agra. Ho-Chin-Minh, let's not drag the scene and make it lengthy. Why not divide the hidden treasure? 70-30 - No way. 60-40. - Impossible. 50-50. You search for it downstairs and I'll search it upstairs. Kali da, we're under pressure. What are you doing alone? I'm Raja Dhumrokalap Roy. I fed 2000 Brahmins on my mother's funeral. We had set up tents from Marathakhal to Sutanuti. And now.. my successors are finding it difficult to.. Get two square a day for themselves. Emotional scene.. You have promised to marry my grandson's granddaughter. You promised to save this house. But you've decided to share the hidden treasure with.. Those cunning tenants. Scoundrel Bangal (from East Bengal) fellow! - You'll hurt me. Don't abuse me by calling me Bangal, you're Ghoti (hailing from west Bengal). Suffering from Alzheimer. Put the sword down. Listen to me, You Majesty. Get out of the angry young man's image. Think a little hard and you'll remember everything. It's like constipation, a little pressure will help you get it out. Suppose.. it was 1911. - Okay. The Englishmen shifted their capital to Delhi. During that time alcoholic Peterson was a painter. He thought that he was the illegitimate son of Rembrandt. Peterson made me believe that our country was in.. Deplorable state because of foreigners like him. I was in a mood to fight for India's struggle back then. Are we in a story reading session? Stop your nonsense and listen to me. On one such day.. "He's a jolly good fellow." "He's a jolly good fellow." "He's a jolly good fellow." Dhumro.. be steady.. don't move. Shut up, you foreigner. Don't you've sense? You've been busy painting. You couldn't complete a painting in a year. Scoundrel. It takes time to create a masterpiece. After Michael Angelo, Rembrandt comes Peterson. You don't deserve to be compared with Michael Angelo. I kept you here for so long. Fed you, supplied you with wine and women. Yet you couldn't finish the painting. I'm making masterpiece, Dhumro. A portrait of a black person. I'll name is Black Diamond. Beware! Don't abuse my complexion or I won't spare you. I'll make you forget your colour, Englishman.. If you can't finish the painting I'll call the Frenchmen.. And kick you out. British businessman. - Native dog Pochu.. Pochu, bring my sword. Master! - Bring my sword. I'll teach you a lesson today. Yes, I'll teach you a lesson today. - No.. You businessman.. - Dhumro, have you gone mad.. Or is your stomach upset? - To hell with you. I warned you not to drink scotch. The Bong liver can't stand scotch yet you drank it. Control your master. - It's time to control you. come on. Help! Pochu.. - Yes, master. - Get my hookah. - Okay. Coming, master. The Englishman ha left. He is going to kill me. Help! He is going to kill me. He is going to kill me. I'll teach you a lesson. Englishman, I'll kick you hard. You're abusing me, native fellow. You're mean. You're mad. I'll teach you a lesson. Hail Lord Shiva! Master! Oh god! So, you killed Peterson? - Yes. Yes, my son. I didn't just laze around and enjoy luxuries. I was a freedom fighter from Bengal. I've the blood of Bengal in my body. Enough! You've told me these stories many times. Tell me something about the hidden treasure. I can't remember anything else. Elementary, Watson.. my assistant.. What? You don't remember anything? You forgot something so significant. You still remember the unimportant things. Please don't mind.. you brag a lot. You're an empty pot (kumbha) now. Kumbha.. No.. not Kumbha. No.. Nishumbha. Nishumbha? - Nishumbha is the hidden treasure. Yes. Nishumbha was my constant companion. Six years before my death.. What happened six years before your death? I had kept it with great care. - Where? Where? - In the wardrobe up in the attic. In the wardrobe up in the attic. Sir, are you sure? Do you remember clearly? - Yes. - Yes! It's not in that wardrobe? Is it in some other wardrobe? That one.. What's this?- That's the way to the vault of Dhumro palace. Vault.. filled with gold, silver, precious stones, gems.. hidden treasure. This is not opening. Try hard, my son. Try hard. Where am I? There is so much light yet darkness at the same time. That's not light.. that's darkness. The darkness in which we reside.. The darkness is powerful than light. We can clearly see your greed and sinful thoughts.. In that darkness that's stronger than light. Greed leads to sin and sin leads to death. I feel suffocated. Please let me live. Help! You've promised to marry my grandson's granddaughter. You've promised to help the family. I know.. That you'll run away with the treasure as soon as you get it. Stay in the darkness. - No! You'll rot inside now, wretched fellow. I don't want hidden treasure. I don't want to be rich. I want to see light. I want to live under the sky. I want Gauri. I'm alive. I could see. Yes, I could see the greed inside me. I saw everything. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. I saw everything. Please forgive me. I desired the man who taught me to dream again. The person who gave hope to my family. You're the one. Will you go away, Debashish? How can I do anything? I've fallen down in my own eyes. But, I love you a lot. Go and stand before them once. - Before whom? You've brought all the ancestors down from heaven, son. Come on, speak now. Everybody from the other world is here. Do you love Gauri? Yes. - Think how you can save her. If you don't have sinful thoughts or greed.. This sword will glow in your hands and help you vanquish enemies. But if you're greedy then the sword will kill you. Beware! - Beware! You must cleanse yourself or the dirt will accumulate. Your eyes will be engulfed in darkness. My great grandfather was killed by a native. Revenge! I'll kill all of them and send their mutilated bodies to Scotland. I'm William Peterson's.. - Shut up! You've always drunk the local liquor with stale snacks.. And now you're talking of Scotch? Do you want to get hanged by killing four half-dead Bongs? Think about the treasure. Only William Peterson can help us. But I've heard that he's an alcoholic and womanizer. His habits didn't leave him after death. Your great grandfather.. Is an alcoholic and characterless man. Alcohol, women, meat.. that's what he.. - Mind your language. Painter. - Painter? Or carpenter? Did he get the license to be promiscuous just because.. He's an artist? He's busy romancing the skeleton of women. Only Peterson can guide us to the hidden treasure if we can.. Arouse feelings of revenge in his mind. It's difficult to arouse his soul and you're talking of revenge. We must find a solution, Kali da. We need one person's help. Majantali Sarkar. William Peterson.. can you hear me? William Peterson.. father of Guitarson. Grandfather of Cheaterson. Oh no! I'm getting confused. Forget it. You're lost. Please come to the enquiry office. Can you hear me, William Peterson? Let away light. Let away light. I'm William Peterson right from Scotland. I got down at Sutanati and became the prince of the black people. But, I gave into bad habits and became licentious. My colour. He resembles me. Who is your father? Nisumbha.. Kumbha.. Dhumro.. 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' What's this? Take a look. 'One brother stays in hand while the other goes away.' Yes.. I want to know what it is. I've remembered. - Have you? I've remembered. - Tell me. I wrote it with great care and kept Nishumbha there. - Okay. That's a clue. - Another clue! There's no sign of the treasure only.. Please tell me the meaning of this. 'One brother stays in hand while the other goes away.' The meaning is not clear to me. So, you're pulling my leg? What do you think of yourself? Are you a renowned detective? What did you think of your successors? That they would be born as sharp detectives.. And de-code all the clues. - No.. no.. You're the one.. the renowned detective. You've to solve the mystery. The others are stupid idiots. - No! Don't try to flatter me. I give up. I was finding it difficult to de-code two lines.. And now he has come up with the third. William Peterson.. when the native saw that you're an alcoholic.. He killed you with a sword. Then he cut you into pieces and buried you. Hey! Buy me a whisky.. Or.. keep this beautiful girl with me and leave. Let me see if I can recall. "The dim light arouses romantic feelings.." Characterless man! She's your grandson's, grandson's daughter. Shut up, you native. We must bring distant relatives close. He's such a promiscuous man. He's just showering his love on his granddaughter. - Correct. There's no network here. Go and check the tower. 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' He's suffering from rabies. He'll bite you. - No.. Iron can't break iron. Dhumro, you killed me. Your successors will starve to death. My beautiful granddaughter will get the hidden treasure. Your granddaughter will get everything. What about us? - Will we get nothing? Think.. think hard.. you're busy hugging her. Shut up, black native. Give me some clue. 'One brother stays in hand while the other goes away.' They're four brothers.. but the clue mentions two. Who's Nishumbha? What relation does he have with them? Nishumbha? Sumbha and Nisumbha are two brothers. - What do you mean? It's a story that everybody in our family knows. We've heard this story since our childhood. Tell me the story. - I'll tell you. The story goes like this.. Sumbha and Nisumbha are two brothers. Some people say that they're brothers while some say.. They're asuras (demons). Whatever they may be.. they were loved by our family. - Okay. We've heard their stories since childhood. It's not just us but our previous generation.. Has also heard their stories. Why are they so famous? They didn't get Nobel prize or Oscar. I'm not getting any clue. Oh no! Too much of local liquor has made me.. Lose my command over Bengali language. Let me try. Next line. 'Double edition of the opposite of 'ajuto'.' Well.. double means a pair. Right? - Right! Deba.. does the pair mean these two brothers? - No.. What do you have to say? After thinking very hard last night.. With the help of periodical table and differential calculus.. I've found out the arithmetical meaning of the first line. Just see. - he's so disturbing. What is it? Bi means 2. Mathematically bi means 2. Chotka, please. - No. he's right. In English this is the actual meaning. Bi means 2. - 2.. 'pad' means legs. Yes it means legs. If you leave out bi from the word 'bipod'.. What stays behind is pad. - Yes. 'Pad' means. What is the opposite of ajuto? Opposite? Opposite of night is day. Opposite of thin is fat. White and black. - Sumbha Nishumbha. Precious and cheap. Impossible and possible. Ajuto and 'juto' (shoes). Yes! Ajuto and juto. - Shoes? Whose shoes? I don't know that but opposite of ajuto is juto. 'One brother stays in hand while the other goes away.' 'One brother stays in hand while the other goes away.' Why is he not wearing nay shoes? That's how it's always been. Don't roam around bare-footed. What of anything pricks your feet you'll be dead? Foot! Foot! Foot. - Foot? - Shoes. Yes, my grandson. A pair of shoes. Dhumro had thrown one at me. There's a diamond in his shoe. That's the hidden treasure. That's it! That's it! Sumbha. Nisumbha. The one on the right foot was named Sumbha and.. The one on the left was named Nisumbha. Two precious diamonds I got from Brazil. Diamond! After Prince Dwarakanath I was the one who wore diamonds.. In his shoes. - Diamond! The shoe that was painted got covered with dirt and grime. What next? When Peterson started created problems this was.. The only foot that had been drawn. The other shoe was not yet drawn so I'm barefooted. What next? - I started running after him. What next? - He started running. I threw a show at him. I lost one shoe but I kept the other one with great care. That's why you don't wear shoes even after death. - Yes. So you didn't mean Agra's Bhuto. You meant.. Nagra juto (shoes). - Yes! You'll get the treasure once you find the shoes. The scoundrel heard Agra's Bhuto. Deaf fellow. "Bipod' missed its target.' 'Double edition of the opposite of 'ajuto'.' 'One brother stays in hand while the other goes away.' 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' Yes. 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' "Bipod' missed its target.' 'Double edition of the opposite of 'ajuto'.' 'One brother stays in hand while the other goes away.' 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' Got it! 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' Gouri! Gouri! This is the last line of the clue. Only he can solve it. Catch him. Sumbha and Nisumbha were two big diamonds. Sumbha and Nisumbha were two big diamonds. They were stuck in Dhumrokalap's shoes. Your great grandfather told about the nagra shoes. You'll get the hidden treasure if you get the shoes. Nagra Juto? - I told you.. Agra's Bhuto. Your father misheard him and thought that.. You would get the hidden treasure if two Bhutos from Agra come here. Nagra juto. "Bipod' missed its target.' It means that one shoe got lost when he hit Peterson with it. He never found that shoe. But my great grandfather didn't tell us where the other shoe is. No. Because he was suffering from Alzheimer's. So no one knows where the diamonds are. Only one person knew it. - Who? My grandma Belun Bala Devi. Belun Bala! - I told you all are kala (deaf). She found out Nishumbha while she was on her death bed. She too had the habit of speaking in rhymes. Gauri, one never gives up habit. She gave Bhombol a clue in the form of a rhyme. 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' Bhombol became mad because he couldn't solve it. Yes. You're right. The line.. 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' tells us where those shoes are. It's written. - Written? Catch it. Catch it. 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' Why are the alphabets of the world 'Basanta' written separately? We generally write them together. - Yes. Well in that case the word 'basan' means.. - Clothes. Clothes become clean and bright. What does that mean? What does that mean? It means clean sparkling clothes. What makes clothes bright? - Sodium nitrate. Soap. - Yes. soap. Even by thrashing.. - When we beat clothes with a washing bat. The washing place. Thrashing.. - The washing bat. 'Thrashing makes 'basanta' clean and bright.' Let me see. This one? Dirt has accumulated on it. It has become dirty due to use. So, it's not Bhuto. - Nagra juto. For the first time he heard the wrong word but meant the right thing. Am I a fool? Is it written in medical science that a deaf person will hear wrongly.. In his dream? Brother's condition is beyond medical. - Magical. Vertically genetically. - Yes. What's that? - What's that? Diamond! - Diamond! Diamond! - Diamond! Diamond! - Diamond! No one ever guessed that there could be a diamond in the shoe. Only my grandma Belu Bala Devi found out. Diamond hidden inside the washing bat. Repeat after me.. Hail Dhumrokolap! Hail aunt! Hands up! - Oh god! Move. Hands up! Illusion can be deceptive. Our wish has come true even before praying for it. Will it upset my stomach if I drink this? - So what? Where will we get this? Oh god! She swallowed it. She swallowed the diamond? It'll come out with her poop tomorrow morning. What if it melts in her stomach? Who will go? - No one. There are chances that it may melt. - What? - What? What a problem! The precious stone. Goal! - Oh no! - Don't worry, dear. Come on, Debashish. Come on. What's this? He's Bhuto Chine. The lean and thin fellow. God saved the lord. And lord saved the diamond. Here I am for the last act. The great grandson of great William Cheaterson.. Peterson. Cheers! - Shut up! Shut up! Magical hands! Well-done! Encore! - Encore! He's running away. Catch him. Look at me, Debashish. - Don't look. Look at me. - You've to become rich, Debashish. We'll share it, Debashish. No! 33-33-33. - Okay. 1 % free for our young Annie. Debashish, we love each other. Look at me. If you're not greedy than this sword will glow in your hands. It'll help you vanquish your enemies. We don't want anything, Debashish. Hey! He's a stupid fellow! If the ghost kills you.. you'll be jailed for seven days.. And hanged for three days. Kalicharan, run from here. Run away or they'll kill you. - I'm going. All the goons have left. So it was not false. - You're right. Here is your treasure. But I can't accept it. - Why? He won't be able to digest it. - He may vomit it out. No.. no.. why will it rain now? - No! You also have a share in it. You're our own. Actually.. I've got my treasure. Take care of it. - Yes. Just get us married. - Amen! We'll enjoy tonight. We'll set up pandals in the terrace. I pray that my children are blessed with happiness. And I pray that mine gets soda and whisky. He has come. Strange! - Weird! They got Nishumbha.. but what about Sumbha? "There was a family of four brothers." "Kirti, Kriya, Keka, Krishna." "There was a family of four brothers." "Kirti, Kriya, Keka, Krishna." "Their wives would shout all the time." "Fish wasn't allowed for four days a week." "Haunted house." "Cat and mouse." "Haunted house." "Cat and mouse."
