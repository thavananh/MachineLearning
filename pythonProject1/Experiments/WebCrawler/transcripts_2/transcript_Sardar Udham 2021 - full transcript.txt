[Chains clanking] [Marching order] [Door closing sound] [Market chatter] [Door knocking] Clothes... Nand Singh is here. Send him. All HSRA comrades are either arrested or shot dead. Our movement has ended. -Passport? -Lahore. I need a pistol! You won’t be able to cross the border. It will be delivered to you in Afghanistan. London's details. You're being followed. [Market chatter] -When did he leave? -Last night. Why don't you settle down? You all want to kiss the noose, right? Water... Take care, cousin. Good afternoon, Sir! -Yes? -Sir, Sher Singh is absconding. Since when? Since a week. Come. Putting you through now. -Hello. -SP Patiala, Sir. We found an application of a new passport, for England, Sir. It matches the description of the suspect, Sher Singh. But the passport is issued in the name of Ude Singh, Sir. Name again? Ude Singh, Sir! Send through all the old photographs you have and the aliases. -We'll do what we can to help. -Right, Sir! [Speaks Russian] [Man praying] -For long, the Britishers have fooled us. -Hmm. Our youth has become complacent. -They say we have access to trains, electricity, cinema halls… -Huh. The British are doing so much. They don't realize the British are doing this for a purpose... They dig deep into our land to loot us… ...rob us of our resources and then, load the loot for England. [Whistles] [Grass hustling] [Footsteps] Bhagat! -Get the boxes. -How many revolvers? Eight. -Rounds? -300. -He has never fired a gun but is a master at sourcing them -[Laughter] Working, right? Send these to Rawalpindi. Yes. [Speaks Russian] [Dogs barking] A romantic folk tale? -So, you've converted to being a socialist! -[Smiles] Love for humanity, that’s what it's all about! If something happens to me, you know they won’t spare me. for the organization to function smoothly after me, I need to share something. In that case, we will need a third person. Why? Because they're not going to spare me either. I am destined to meet the same fate. Hello...is anyone around? If the turnaround is to happen...it is now or else forget about the revolution! [Laughter] [Speaks Russian] [Ship horn] Foreign passports to immigration! -Here you go. -Thank you. Passport? Go. Passport please. Here you go. Uh, Oxford street? Sure, Sir. "The nation is finally showing its first major signs of a recovery, unemployment has begun to fall and the drop in interest rates has led to a booming construction in the South stimulating renewed economic growth. The two dictators, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini have previously met in Venice. Il Duce arrived in Munich today. with his foreign minister Count Ciano, to discuss immediate plans with the Fuhrer. Thousands cheered the Fascist leaders who agreed on a Hands-Off-Austria policy in what is being termed as a historic event." Koppikar - Punjab restaurant He's not here, you can check at the Sikh temple. So you never returned to America… then you should have been here 6 months ago? HSRA, back home, is completely dismantled. And you'll regroup here? We barely have funds, we need to spend wisely. What's your plan? Indians here are contented. How will you shake up their conscience? Under what name have you entered? -Sher Singh. -Change it! By now MI5 and Scotland Yard would have issued alerts. Take up a job. And as the British say, 'lie low for sometime.' Let me introduce you... this is Abir Mukherjee. A barrister, and our ideologue. Dutta, Sumer Singh, Rihana Siddiqui, a lawyer. In-charge of women's wing. Sameer Bandopadhyay... and that’s Surat Ali. Associated with the Indian Workers union. Behind you, our youth wing workers. And you'll meet Johal at the Sikh temple. When did you last meet Bhagat Singh? Before being arrested. Then, I just got his letter. What were his last words? To garner international support. Can you speak English? I can manage. These are some contacts. Can I have a sweet? Mother! Mother… Is anyone alive? [Gunshot] "With Hitler continuing unrestrained in his pursuance of Nazi world domination the writing on the wall is clear. That world is headed for all out war. Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement policy has clearly failed the nation and first lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, in his wartime broadcast has warned the nation to be prepared for a long conflict of 3 years or more." Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great privilege for me to be here to talk to you on behalf of the East India Association and the Royal Central Asian Society. In the war that is at our door step, the empire will need all her fighting men. In the last war, I filled all the quotas for Indian soldiers. Over 100,000 Sikh soldiers from my Punjab fought for the crown. And I made sure that the Indians contributed generously... to the war loan. The Empire was and is a force for good. And that is why, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only our right but our duty to rule India. Without us, they will return to savagery, looting and killing one another. It is not only Africa ladies and gentlemen, that is the white man’s burden. With the benefit of my experience, I can tell you that these reforms have been effective. The country is unified once more. It is peaceful. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. [Cheering continues] Great to see you. Mister Dwyer! -[Gun shots] -[Screams] Police! It is all over! All over! It is all over. I shot him! I shot him! Caxton Hall! Stretcher coming through. It’s all over, it’s of no use! It is all over! Check his pulse. He killed thousands. He has killed thousands. It is all over. [Indistinct murmur] [Crowd hurling abuses] -Hello... -Lady O'Dwyer... He shouted "Sir Dwyer.” He fired 6 shots. [Crying] And the shot... it hit him in the chest. -[Gasps] -I'm so sorry. "Sir Michael O’Dwyer, the former Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab during the time of the Amritsar affair of was shot dead by an Indian man in London earlier today. Sir Michael was addressing a meeting of the East India Association presided over by Lord Zetland, the Secretary of State for India, who was badly injured. Former Governors of Punjab and Bombay Lord Lamington and Sir Louis Dane were also wounded and are now receiving emergency treatment in hospital. The assassin who fired six shots in quick succession was immediately apprehended by the police." He served the British Empire dutifully in the most turbulent period of time in the Punjab. between the years 1912 and 1919. "Germany calling!" "Germany calling!" "Germany calling!" "This is Lord Haw Haw. The sun finally seems to be setting over the British empire. Like their elephants, the Indians never forget their enemies. They strike them down -even after twenty years." -Bloody Indians! Who is behind this murder? Witnesses have confirmed that he is a man of Indian origin. We have recovered a pistol and live ammunition from him, about nine rounds. Further links are being investigated. But we will not tolerate such violence. Such acts of terrorism. A cowardice within our country. We will stand up together and rise up against brutal crime and we will crush any movement against the Empire! I am absolutely certain... he won’t name anyone. But... he did it! He was always stubborn. Hats off to him. I mean... Such coverage by the world press... no incident has been covered so widely. Reported across 12-15 countries. Tell me who your other associates are? [Grunts] [Coughs] What organization do you work for? [Coughs] [Groans] Why did you do this? Tell me the names of your associates? [Groans] Uh... -Who are your associates? -[Groans] Keep going. This is the last place he lived? Yes, Sir. Check underneath the bed. Sir. Quite the collection. Take a look at this, Sir. Directory. Hmm... Caxton Hall. Alright. You sure he is the same man? Yes Sir, we are certain of it, Sir! Punjab ’39... Punjab ’33 here we go, this is the one. Well if he is our man and he came in six years ago what the hell has he been doing since then? Bring him down. You are coming with us. Sit down and shut up! -Who all have come from India? -Sir, I did. -When did you enter England? -In January. Show me your passport! What do you know about this Sher Singh? On your feet. Are you Surat Ali? Mr. Koppikar... -do you know this man? -Yes. I had nothing to do with this killing. He did it alone. You deny your links to the Communist party? [Exhales] No. So, he met you quite a few times this umm...? Yes, at the Sikh temple, a couple of times may be. Just a couple? Maybe more, I don’t remember. -How did he get the gun? -I don’t know. You don’t know? That’s all? Yes, that’s all. You will have to come with us, Sir. He is a small time businessman... his name is Bawa. Fond of 'laddoos'... I mean sweets. Very passionate about India’s independence. What else? I told you, Sir. He used to visit the Sikh temple sometimes. Cut this nonsense. What else? I don’t know much about him. Right, so what have we got? Well, we figured out he worked in a cotton mill in the Punjab… in about 1919. -Any Family? -An orphan. His mother died when he was six. His father soon after that. He and his brother, Ude, they grew up in an orphanage. Any other relatives? Some cousins, but we are not sure yet. Immigration records show he entered London several times since 1933 using different names, Sher singh, Ude Singh, Udham Singh, Azad singh and Frank Brazil. He first settled in a small apartment in East London, and constantly shifted residences almost every 6 months, -from the East across to the Southwest, at Bournemouth. -Yeah. While here...he tried to organize an international network of rebels for the Ghadr party making contact with sources across Europe. There is a police complaint against him in for publicly beating another Indian in a brawl in a bar in South London. He obtained a local peddler's license working odd jobs as a stationery salesman, also as an extra on a movie set. I am a salesman. Sometime later, he is spotted at a flea market selling lingerie, and he owns a Fiat car by now… our last entry in the records show him working as a welder in an iron factory in East London. This was about 6 months before the assassination. I heard this man was under our watch! How did he slip through? Well, he was put under watch nine years ago Sir, when he left prison in India... and in that time he basically kept his head down and we lost track of him. Few weeks ago we had a tip off from the passport office, but by the time we had got there, he had already fled. Are there any other conspirators? Any other associates? There may be others waiting to strike at high level targets. Have a look at the Germans, -we can’t take any chances. -Sir. -[Groans] -Who are you? What is your name? When is the next attack gonna happen? You thought you got them all... didn’t you? Well you didn’t! Only four bullets? I had pumped in all six. Zetland is also dead, right? He said he fired six times. Isn’t Zetland dead? Only O'Dwyer? I am gonna ask you... one more time. Who are your associates? [Groans] [Laughs] I do not feel pain... I see death... feel no pain. Water... Water... [Grunting] You have eluded us for nine years. You must have made some really nice friends. Come on, tell me their names! Tell me everything about your collaborators. Come on... Tell me about the next target. [Yells in pain] [Muffled cry] -Who... -[Painful sobbing] is the next attack for? Come on you can tell me. [Yells in pain] Just try... just try and give us one little name. [Yells in pain] Tell me of all the other important figures you were following. [Speaks Russian] Are you Russian? Are these your papers? So... did he have any visitors? An Indian man... and a lady. An Indian lady? No. British? Yes. -Detective Thomson, Sir. -Yes, put him through. Sir, he was frequently visited by a British woman, an active member of the communist party, I suspect he may have established links with other extremists through her. [Crowd protesting] Down with imperialism! World in peace! Not in pieces! Eileen... Eileen Palmer... Eileen? I... I...Surat Ali...friend. Surat Ali's friend. You are not registered with the party, are you? Party? Uh...yes, yes I was... Ah...In India...HSRA... I was...party. H.S.R.A? Bhagat Singh’s H.S.R.A? You know him! -You know Bhagat Singh...? -Yeah [Smiles] What do you want? I need help. I fight for freedom of my people. Fight for the freedom of the whole world! World...Umm... no... You equal, you march for being equal... I'm not equal. I'm not free. When my country is free... then, I shall march as an equal, for equality. Hmm! I am Detective Inspector Swain. I am in charge of your case. You can start by telling us your name. What is your actual name? Tell us your name. No? [Yells in pain] [Groans] [Coughs] This is Scotland Yard. We will dig everything out one way or another. So... who were your collaborators and... regular associates? Who else is with you? There is no way that a carefully planned assassination like this can be carried out without the support of a big organization. Which organization is behind this assassination? There has to be an organization! You first came to England in 1933. Is that right? Since when you were a regular at the... Shepherd’s Bush Sikh temple, and the Punjab Restaurant? You must have had the support of all our... regular rebels who frequent such places? Did you meet other extremists at the Sikh temple? Koppikar... S.S. Johal, Surat Ali. You honestly expect me to believe that they were not involved? What about Eileen Palmer? What’s the nature of your association with Eileen Palmer? What is your relationship with her? When did you meet her? When you first came here? This way, miss. In you go. So you admit that you know him? You surely knew he was a wanted man before he came to England. I knew him but... he didn’t talk much. His past is a mystery to me as well. So...for just how long have you known him? It’s been about four years! And you saw him throughout that period? Frequently... but not all the time. You knew him... very well. Would you say that you were... just a friend or... maybe a little more than that? Hmm? Don’t you think that’s personal? Were you aware...of what he was planning to do? No! I already told you… I didn’t know. Contact of Lewis and Connor they work with the IRA. Have you met them? No. “In a major raid on suspected Irish Republican Army hideouts, the police have seized more than 3 tons of explosives along with large amount of propaganda material seeking new recruits to join the Irish rebellion. Seven men have been arrested and one fatally shot.” You...Stop...Now! [Gunshot] “Intelligence agencies say the raid was significant in preventing the IRA from imminent acts of sabotage on British soil. The call to ban the Irish nationalist guerrilla group has been gaining momentum in political circles.” So what is it that you are planning to do? Hmm? You are planning something... how can I stop you? I need guns. -Your contacts from IRA or... -I have nothing to do with them! I'm a prisoner, in my own country… under watch all the time. I can’t...I...I can’t... I have no choice…no liberty, cannot express my voice Even poetry is banned, No free will... can’t breathe... I am here in exile, forced out of my own country... If you want the freedom of your people... you should be there, not here... Go back... Go home...and fight shoulder to shoulder with them. Shoulder to shoulder? Yes I would like to… I can't... My party HSRA, finished... everybody shot...hanged. So I fight in a different way. Eileen! Please! Please! -This house? -Just through there. From the left. -There...? thank you. -Yeah. No problem. Hmm! I want the landing in India. Balance... after delivery. Why should I trust you? You know of Bloody Sunday? I have lived it, in India... I have seen death. Have not slept, in years... Your revolution and mine, is the same Our enemy, common! You and I both are lambs, to the same butcher. You see Eileen, I am finding it increasingly hard to believe that you were unaware of his extremist activities. He wasn’t regular in any manner. In fact he was erratic, somewhat capricious. While he was here, he made a deal between the IRA and the Indian rebels... for arms... fortunately we intercepted that shipment. Are you aware of that? "British police have foiled an arms conspiracy between Irish and Indian rebels after a major consignment containing grenades, rifles and pistols was intercepted at the port of Calcutta, in Northern India. Links with the banned revolutionary group, the IRA are being investigated..." How did this blunder happen? Were your contacts trustworthy? The leak was internal... Now? Surveillance on us has increased, there have been raids in Ireland. Staying here is risky. Leave for Russia immediately. You be safe. And thank you, for helping. You are not going to come back? I will continue my fight. There is a re-entry here under the name of Ude Singh, is that you? We have confirmation now that you re-entered from Russia. Who did you meet? The Red Army? The communist politburo? Another arms deal perhaps? Where was the delivery planned...hmm? Here in London or was it Spain? Is that why you travelled to Spain from Russia? To support the communists in their civil war? [Speaks Russian] But... without the support of an anti-colonial country like yours Who would listen to us? You are a world power... it is vital that you intervene against the imperialist British. Our comrades don’t have weapons, how will they fight? We need weapons. We will discuss with the Politburo, and I assure you that the Soviet Union is with you. But we are busy preparing for war and now is not a good time for us. So, what else were you planning then? A little bombing campaign perhaps? Did you go to Russia and Germany? Who did you meet there? Did you really think that the Nazis and the Russians... would lend a helping hand and we would just stand idly by? [Chuckles] You want us to believe that you came back only for O'Dwyer? Hmm? Yes? He lives near Kensington Gardens. Visits church on Mondays. Cinema hall on Fridays. And the club on Saturdays. -Sure it is him? -I've seen him. So Michael, I'll see you at 12 o’clock. [Laughter] And so ladies and gentlemen, we come to Amritsar. And inevitably if we come to Amritsar, we talk about General Dyer. Now one knows the authorities’ opinion of General Dyer and so did he. He died a broken man, but unrepented. And I have no hesitation in saying that General Dyer’s action that day was the decisive factor in crushing the rebellion. [Crowd clapping] The seriousness, the seriousness of which is now generally realized. But the Hunter commission would not hear a word of evidence to say that the Punjab rebellion was connected in any way whatsoever to the Afghan invasion. The Indian Congress made a report that's called the Indian Congress Report on the Punjab. Most of it written by Gandhi. And in that he says... that it was my intention to crush... political consciousness in India. No Mr. Gandhi... my intention... was to crush lawlessness...and rebellion! [Crowd clapping] [Gunshot] [Breathing heavily] [Gunshot] Exquisite! How much for the box? Free, Sir. -Free? -For you. -For me? -Yes. Ah... I... I know you, Sir. I served below you. You were the Governor, I... I was a worker at the factory... Railways...India! India...ah...Thank you, Emma! India...hmm... That’s a trait I have always admired in the Indians. The willingness to please. India huh! Awful weather, terrible food. Never bothered to learn the language. But I served the crown well in India. Now, the ordinary people... the common people, the peasants, they liked us. Never had any trouble with us! -But the educated... -Sir... some of my friends...not me, friends, students... they protested along with the commoners. Students... communists... they incited the common people... they instigated the rebellion. I am also educated, Sir. But you seem rational. You are here, in the heart of the British Empire... making a good, honest, lawful living like us. You’ll make a good salesman. Thank you, Sir. H.S.R.A. Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. Is this organization still active? HSRA...you used to be a member! Is Koppikar or... S.S. Johal a member? Hmm? You were associated with Bhagat Singh too, didn’t you? Don’t talk about Bhagat Singh! He says let’s not talk about him. I have your whole history here... you might as well tell me. Now wake up man! They are not going to let you walk away from this, this time! They are going to hang you like they did Bhagat Singh! They call us 'Rebels'... If asking for your rights, is being rebellious… then, yes, we are rebels! That was earlier, now they label us ‘Terrorists!’ There is a difference between a terrorist and a revolutionary... A significant difference! A revolutionary's action is symbolic meant to register a protest. Their motive is not to create fear. On the contrary, they inspire to fight for rights! People's own rights! Purpose of a revolutionary is to fight for freedom. And freedom for all! A true revolutionary has to follow certain tenets. You cannot be prejudiced, nor communal, nor casteist. There is no economic or social class difference. The only truth... is equality. Equality! To treat all humans as equals, with a strong belief in humanity! There is a significant difference, brother! -Yes, understood. -Okay, Bhagat... after freedom; what first? Oh! After freedom... I will watch a Chaplin film, buy an expensive British wine... and… -Ma'am -Me? With a English lady by my side... I will do the ball dance. [Laughter] …then just eat and sleep. [Laughter] Then get up in the morning have a bath... -and repeat the routine... -[Laughter] Ask him... what was he doing when he was 23? He is asking what you were doing when you were 23? What was I doing when I was 23... Tell me. I was just married. We were expecting our first born. I was the... youngest detective constable on the force. Happy days! Hmm... So don’t talk about Bhagat Singh! You know nothing about him. "The two men responsible for throwing bombs at the central assembly hall in Delhi have been identified as Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt, both belonging to the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. Shouting slogans like ‘Long live the revolution,’ ‘Down with imperialism’ and ‘Workers of the world unite,’ Both men did not flee after the act but willingly courted arrest. Throwing pamphlets that cited their rationale for the bombing, "To make the deaf hear." With the Labour party watching closely the ruling Conservatives have decided to order strict prosecution of the members of the revolutionary outfit, H.S.R.A. In a nationwide strike, police have successfully raided suspected hideouts in Lahore and Saharanpur, killing several members and arresting some prominent ones including Sukhdev and Rajguru, both wanted as conspirators in the Saunders murder case along with Bhagat Singh himself." "They may... kill me... But cannot kill my ideas. An ideology whose time has come is unstoppable. You will never earn your rights, unless you rise up in protest or fight the oppressors. Independence without... a true ideology... can be worse than slavery. Freedom is our birth right... and therefore we reject this oppressive regime. And for the criticism of resorting to violence. We are not blood thirsty, we do not harbour hate toward any individual or country. We are simply against the exploitation of one by the other. Most importantly... we do not want our rights in piecemeal. Neither the illusion of semi-independence. We want the welfare of the entire world... farmers, workers and students… and therefore we demand... absolute independence... and a total revolution!" He's been quite for some time now, Sir. And? Well I certainly think he is a committed Marxist. Very ideologically driven, Sir. Hasn’t named anyone as yet. We need to get him to confess. Press charges. Get him to talk. Do what it takes. Sir. So then... between you and me... what’s your real name? Hmm? Oh, there’s so many passports! And aliases. Frank Brazil? Is this you? Hmm? -Yes! -[Chuckles] Well then according to this... [Clears throat] peddler's license that was issued in Bournemouth in 1933… you are Udham Singh. Yes. You haven’t got a lot of time left. It’s important for your own sake... that we know what your real name is. Hmm? Ram Mohammed Singh Azad. The decision of tattooing his name on his body specifically this name, Ram Mohammed Singh Azad, he definitely wanted it discovered and for that news to be spread. What is the meaning of this? Uh... Sir, it is [Clears throat] symbolic of... Indian religious unity. We need to control the press. No matter what we do... there will be many who will... see his actions... as an act of revolution, Sir! I said it at that time... Dwyer was responsible... for a monstrous event. But we cannot allow that to affect our decision making. Yes, Prime Minister. His defence lawyers will try and stall. -But we should speed things up. -Sir. This business has to be ended here. -I agree... -India protests every day. We don’t get to see it thankfully. But London must not protest anymore… and prolonging this trial will only ensure that. Good morning, Sir! Your Majesty... There are a... lot... of Indian soldiers fighting for us in this war. Are there not, Prime Minister? Yes there are. A meek surrender... to this mad man... would be to embolden the voices of rebellion... amongst the Indian soldiers. We can’t afford to be seen as, as weak. I understand. Your Majesty! After the war... will the crown... quit India? Let us just say… we will need to reinvent... a way of maintaining our strategic presence... in the subcontinent. We have a terrorist and a lunatic... ...who had no special aim or purpose. It was a crazed violent attack... and nothing else. Sir, is this incident a threat to the British Empire? No... this is a stray incident... by a crazed lunatic... who has no further links. [Yells in pain] [Sighs] Is anyone alive? [Factory siren] See you tomorrow. What are you doing here? You'll get me in trouble. Come here. How did you get here? You want to run it? Hey... come on. Pull. Hold the belt and pull upwards. No, no...upwards. Come here... Hey, I was just joking... give me your hand. Thank you. Support for Udham Singh. Long live Udham. Mr. Nihal Singh? Yes. So, he tried to kill your supervisor? No, just... raised his voice. Threatened him. Well, it still shows clear criminal intent. No... not… not criminal. You just said he threatened him. Hmm? He was... somewhat unpredictable... he would talk about an Utopian world, but never... The man is a habitual criminal accustomed to threatening people. Take his statement. I did it all by myself! Well, you must really hate the British! -Do you hate the British? -No I have many British friends too. I don’t hate them. Then O’Dwyer? So was it just revenge? No. Michael O’Dwyer... personified the evil of British imperialism. I am against that evil! O’Dwyer embodied British imperialism in my country. You too are... working for your government, but in your own country. I don’t hate you. You are doing your job. [Muffled cry] [Gasps] [Coughs] [Gasping] Sign your confession. Write down that you helped him purchase the guns twice. You helped him buy the guns...Sign it! He is a criminal. He had guns. I’ll ask you for the last time... [Gunshot] Stand up! Stand up… Good morning. My name is John Hutchison. These are my credentials. Robert Clayton and Sons. V.K. Menon will also be with me in the court. Hmm! I was born in... Kanpur. I studied law after coming here. Law? Huh… law… When a country punishes a person, you quote the law... but when a country commits crime against another country would your law call it a crime? The British have committed a crime! And continue to do so. Mr. Singh, I know you think you don’t need a lawyer. You will have to co-operate, if you want me to present your defence. So, let’s start from the beginning. When did you plan the assassination? When did you plan the assassination? It's important that they read back that sermon next week… but anyway Richard, it’s good to see you, I'll see on Sunday. -Good luck! -See you next week, Sir Michael. Salesman, where’s your box? Where’s your pens? Ah, not everyone has taste like you, Sir. Uh-huh! You ought to be selling rifles. There’s a war coming, money to be made. Ah...I need a job, Sir. What do you do? I am a good carpenter… a good electrician, I can wash clothes... -I... -Okay, okay. Come around to the house. We will see what we can do for you. Okay? Grateful, Sir. Thank you. I’ll be meeting Tony and Slanders at the club this evening you know. -I'll give them your love. -Yes, please do. Aren’t they pretty flowers now? They are fresh from the garden. Got the hunt on Monday. Ah, yes of course. You fancy rabbits on Tuesday night, huh? -It'll be Monday night. -That will be lovely. Sir. Thank you. Now… Got him! Got him! Thank you. Now then... Tell me, salesman... where were you in April, 1919? I... -I was... -I remember. You told me. -Working in the factory, on the railway. -Yes, Sir. You want something, Sir? They deserved it. You can’t rise in rebellion and expect a medal... you got what was coming... ungrateful! -Something bothering you, Sir? -No. Nothing ever bothers me. Would you kill a man to save ten? If I... believe it to be true. Ten men to save a hundred? A thousand, lakhs… Depends, Sir. So, you agree. No. You just said it depended on the circumstances. Circumstance... yes... what one goes through… I know about it. You know nothing. Fear is a deterrent. Mutiny was brewing. There would have been another river in the Punjab. A sixth river... a river of blood. 1857 all over again. Fear was the key... and fear worked. I ended Gandhi’s soul force with brute force! Huh... There were women… children... -...wounded. -Wounded? Their relatives carried them away. Carry away how, Sir? There was curfew. Martial law… shoot at sight orders. People were afraid to take people to the hospital… Nonsense. Nonsense! When he stopped firing... that was a sign that it was good for them to go. So, you don’t think it was brutal, Sir? It was sufficient. He was faced with a seditious mob. He created fear... and it was sufficient. Hmm... How can someone be so demonic? He had absolutely no remorse for what he did! So you left the job? Otherwise I would have killed him. but that would not have registered as a protest. It would be construed as a crime against an employer and that would have tainted the credibility of all workers. And then? "Just to update you on the news from Europe if you've just turned on your radios Great Britain is now at war with Germany. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain announced this fact in a broadcast at 6:15 pm New York time, 6:15 Eastern Standard time. In a brief broadcast of about five minutes' duration which was carried over the CBS network, the Prime Minister said that I have to tell you... we are now at war with Germany." "A nationwide blackout has been announced with all lights to be extinguished during air raids. The government has issued a call for up to 2 million young men..." Why don’t you finish your flipping job, idiot! I will cut your wages! Hey! Stop the work... -Stop working! -Udham. Stop it. This is slavery. Stop it… Udham! The Manager gives us an earful. You are scared of him. Not me. He is scared of the Manager... Manager, of the owner... and the owner, of the regime. And finally the oppressor seated at the top, rules everyone with fear! And they are doing the same back home in India as well! We are humans as well! Don't we all deserve to be equal? We are treated as slaves! Disrespected, not valued at all! What the hell are you doing? -You are disturbing everyone! -What the hell... What the hell are you doing! -I will kill you, bloody imperialists! -What are you doing? Get out! You get out of my country! Stop being reckless! We tried earlier, didn't we fail? We did…but we have to act now! Else we will remain under British rule for 100 years more. Please leave… The world is at war... we are all under watch, we will resume after the war That will be too late! The Britishers are preoccupied with the war, they are terrified of Hitler... ...this is the right time to strike. But why here? We have to force them out of India! Absolutely right, but they think our movement died with Bhagat Singh. We should strike here, right at the heart of London... -our message will travel across the world -And what do we do? We drop a bomb? We'll do that back home. Do you have a gun? Please leave, Udham! Free speech… but I am not free... Aye, Sir! Sir! Wake up! Free speech! What do I say? Aye...drop the bomb! No use… robbing people of their freedom, is futile. Today, you snatch one man's freedom... tomorrow, another will rob yours! Futile! Mother... she would talk about... no, not about independence... about toys… just...[Chuckles] War is most inhuman! Nobody wins! Nobody. Only...hatred wins! Hmm! Aye Bhagat... Bhagat Singh. Ah, my brother! Free speech...always! Don’t snatch. Share. You and me, together. Old man, am I wrong? No? Swear…huh! What would you even swear...Huh! "Every leaf, every shrub knows of my state... only the flower remains ignorant... …the entire garden knows!" That’s it. Free speech! Thank you. Share! Please wait over there for five minutes. [Telephone rings] It says "British Indian." Yes. Right. [Panting] "Germany has announced that all British merchant ships will now be classified as war ships. The government has planned to evacuate 400,000 children from major cities to rural areas. Meanwhile the Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, is set to meet the French premier amid demands for a more..." Alright, Sir. In the war that is at our doorstep, the empire will need all her fighting men. In the last war, I filled all the quotas for Indian soldiers. Over 100,000 Sikhs from my Punjab fought for the crown. And... I made sure that the Indians contributed generously to the war loan. The Empire was... and is... a force for good. And that is why, ladies and gentlemen… it is not only our right, but our duty... to rule India. Without us they will return to savagery, looting and killing one another. It is not only Africa ladies and gentlemen, that is the white man’s burden. -Thank you. -[Crowd clapping and cheering] -Thank you… thank you. -[Crowd applauding] Thank you! Mr. Dwyer! [Gunshots] I waited for 21 years! Will this murder be considered a protest... or this protest be considered a murder by your British law? Thank you. "The trial of the Indian National charged with the murder of Sir Michael O’Dwyer, is set to begin at the Old Bailey, today. The accused, represented by Mr. St. John Hutchison KC and Mr. V.K Krishna Menon has also been charged with committing violent acts aimed at disrupting the peace of the nation. The trial, Crown versus Singh will be presided over by Mr. Justice Atkinson. While prominent members of the local Indian community have condemned the vicious act, the court witnessed an outpouring of support by native Indians in favour of the accused." [Crowd hurling abuses] Get back, please. Quiet! Accused to take stand. Please take oath. Your Lordship, he has requested to take oath on a book of his choice. What sort of book is it? Is it seditious? No, it’s Indian folklore, your Lordship. A classical romance, Heer Ranjha. He has the right to take an oath on the book of his choice. Proceed. My Lord, I would like to call on the case of the state against the accused Mr. Udham Singh. The state contends that the accused is responsible for the criminal act of murder. Proceed. State your name for the record. Shoot me. State your name. This proceeding is a waste of time, just shoot me. -State your name. -Ram Mohammed Singh Azad! State your real name. This is my real name. Accused Udham Singh, do you plead guilty or not guilty? Accused Udham Singh, do you plead guilty or not guilty? I plead not guilty… Not guilty… Dwyer was guilty. You and your policies are guilty. I'll ask you one more time. -Do you plead guilty? -I protested! Your entire British empire is a trading company... that has turned into an imperialistic power ruling us illegally and forcefully! It's a clear admission of guilt, my Lord. I suggest we proceed with sentencing. -The defence has not spoken, your Lordship. -The murderer has spoken enough! We demand a just trial as is laid down by the law of the land. He has shot three people, former public servants in front of hundreds of people. We have witnesses. -But your Lordship... -Overruled. -Have you been arrested before? -Objection, my Lord! -Irrelevant. -Overruled. Have you been arrested before? -Yes. -Prosecuted in a criminal case? -Yes. -How many years have you been in prison? I was in prison for four years... -But not for a crime. -Why on earth would anyone be in prison if they had not committed a crime? No, no, no crime. I was just fighting, fighting for freedom! Freedom is my birth right and fighting for freedom is no crime. There is a complaint against you by an Indian gentleman whose nose you broke in a bar and yet you say you are a freedom fighter. Yes! I was angry! At such apathetic Indians, who stay content with slavery! This man is clearly prone to violence. And if given a chance, I shall do it again. Have you possessed a weapon before the one you acquired to kill Sir Michael O’Dwyer? I have before me a written statement... by the man who sold you an illegal firearm... -...twice. -I'm telling you it was a protest... against you... you, you, Britishers have plundered us... divided us... looted us, robbed us of all dignity... -...finished our economy! -That’s enough! Yes, that is enough! It's time you leave my country! That is enough! Will you stop this political ranting! My Lordship... the weapon has been seized and he has admitted to the crime. -The reason behind what I did was… -Do not speak in this court... -...unless you are asked to! -But your Lordship -he has every right to be heard. -Overruled! We are here to decide on the quantum of sentence based on the crime committed by this man. Under orders of the court... the press would not report on any statements... made by the accused. Do you members of the press, understand this? Yes. I have reached my verdict. The accused is found guilty as charged. The accused would be hanged till death. [Crowd protesting] Down with British imperialism! Down with British tyranny! Long live revolution! Long live revolution! Long live revolution! Long live revolution! Sir... sorry to report he is refusing all food, Sir. Oh, for God’s sake! Don’t make him a martyr! -It’s the last thing we need. -Sir. We need to stop this hunger strike. Sir. [Grunts] [Breathes laboriously] [Gasps] You won’t marry, ever? Then? Friends forever eh? Fine... I won't settle down either. Ah! [Smiles] I have told you everything! Nothing more to tell you, Mr. Swain. I know you are not a killer. You have never killed anyone before in your life. What happened that day? What changed you? -Repeal the Rowlatt Act! -Repeal it, repeal it! -Repeal the Black Act! -Repeal it, repeal it! -Repeal the Rowlatt Act! -Repeal it, repeal it! Move them back! Charge! [Crowd commotion] Barricade the entry. This entry too. Call for more battalions. Gandhi has left Delhi for Amritsar. Arrest Gandhi. Yes, Sir. No one should enter Punjab until further orders. Arrest all the college students. Put them in a detention centre. Cut all the civilian telephone lines until further notice. The Congress leaders, Satyapal and Kitchlew, keep them in detention. Newspapers, destroy tomorrows’ editions. No more publication until further orders. A protest has been called at Jallianwala Bagh but it’s likely to be peaceful! Likely! But it’s going to be political, yes? Yes, Sir! So, it’s an unlawful gathering, isn’t it? -Yes, Sir! -Who do you have in mind for the job? We have briefed Colonel Monago. Hmm... I find him to be hesitant. -Call for General Reginald Dyer. -Yes, Sir. [Military commands] This here, the Golbazaar, JP road burnt down. Entire old city area, has witnessed acts -of rebellion and rioting. -How many dead? The deaths of five Englishmen have been confirmed and there are further reports of a political assembly near the Golden temple tomorrow. Sir, Sir Michael O'Dwyer is on the line for you. Thank you. -Prepare the men. -Yes, Sir. Good evening, Sir. Good evening, General. Amritsar is in the hands of the rebels. It is your job to get it back. I will need your permission to proclaim Martial law, Sir. You are the man on the ground, General. You must act as you deem necessary. Thank you, Sir. Revolution is a dangerous game! We cannot afford another mutiny. -Sir! -I want to set a precedent. Punishment of itself is not necessarily a deterrent. But if the punishment is such that it creates a fear of punishment that would be of great practical value. We need to set an example. -Sir! -Goodnight. You're back again... Almost there... Section 144 is imposed. Assembly of more than 2 people will be shot at. Section 144 is imposed. Martial law is in force. -If more than 2 people are... -The curfew is on, I am leaving. ...assembled together, they will be shot at... No, no gathering for me. I'm taking the day off. No appeal, no argument, no lawyer... this Black law will not be accepted by us. We reject the Rowlatt Act! The arrest of Dr. Satyapal and Kitchlew will not go in vain. This protest will wage on! Until both the leaders are freed... and the Rowlatt Act is rolled back. Soldiers, take your positions! We are not the ones to be scared! -Don't be afraid, sit down! -Should we issue a warning, Sir? Remember Shri Guru Govind Singh. They’ve had their warning. No meetings! -Soldiers... -Listen, sit, sit! Take your positions. Soldiers, take firing position. Don't panic, sit down! Fire! [Screaming] -[Screams] -Guard! Fire! This incident would have gone unnoticed by you. It is just a footnote in your history. Written in fine print in some book. But you weren’t even there when the firing started. So why...what...? -What did you see? -I was late. Very late. [Gasps] Balli, Balli... Balli...? What happened? -[Cries in pain] Ah! -What... What happened? They fired at us in the gathering. -Ah! -Parag! Kamal, Parag! [Cries in pain] Ah! Balli, Balli... -He's been shot... -What? What happened, Balli? -They fired at us. -Quick, hospital from the back lane. -My father was shot. -Come, come. My father is dead! [Cries] -Where is Balli? -Inside. When you're parched with thirst holding on to your last few breaths, how would a drop of water trickle down your throat? [Moaning] Sister Wa... -Ah! -Oh God! Wat... Wat... Sister? Water Water, water? How do you hold on to... ...the last breath of your soul? Dear God. [Panting] -Water… -Ah! -Ah! -Water, water... Sister, water. Water, sister, water... Reshma... Reshma... Reshma! Reshma! Resh... Reshma. [Groans] Brother, brother. [Cries in pain] There, it's almost done. Almost there... Keep your eyes open. It's done. Don't sleep. Sister, sister! [Gasps] Keep him down. Put him down here...! [Cries] Such a young child! There are hundreds more, scattered all across the ground... -I am going back... -Here, have water! Is anyone alive? Brother. Brother, are you fine? You feeling cold? -[Breathes laboriously] -Relax. Brother... Brother, are you okay? -Ah! -Brother... Wait, Wait… -Take me with you. -Yes. -Hey, some water here! -Ah! -Get some water here! -Ah! -Trust in God -[Breathes laboriously] Everything is fine. I'll be right back. [Gasps] Waheguru! Are you okay? That’s it, that's it... Just keep breathing, I'll be back. Water… water... It has been 5-6 hours they have cut the water supply. they've lost a lot of blood. They won't survive. We need a doctor. Waheguru! [Crowd moaning] You be here... I'll be right back. Don’t worry. You’re fine. -How many more? -Hundreds. But they've not lifted the curfew. Morphine. Uncle... My grand daughters are there… -Grand-daughters? -Yes, at the back. Uncle... they are...breathing... their limbs are also moving... Uncle, Un... [Moans] [Wails in pain] Anyone alive out there? Sister... Sister, are you okay? My son... -No! -No, no, no -Do you fly kites? -Uh... -Huh? -Uh... -You've flown kites eh? -Uh... Will you fly kites with me? Huh? You will, right? We'll fly them together… -[Yells] -It’s okay… You're fine. It’s done, well done! Bravo! I'll be back soon. Mother! Brother! Mother... Mother? [Muffled crying] God, have mercy. Have mercy, God. Sir, there has been a firing upon a crowd in Amritsar! Well, don’t panic. Hmm. Casualties? Don’t know Sir. -Wounded? -Many... Hundreds! Section 144 and Martial Law are imposed. Listen! Soldiers are coming back, they're back, run! My husband… My husband? [Cries] -My husband? -Sister, lie down... -My husband. -Sister, sit down, be quiet, Shh! [Military command] They left. I can't find my husband. Where are you? -Where are you? -Is anyone alive? Anyone alive? Message from Sir Michael O’Dwyer, Sir. I have been up all night. Haven’t had any sleep. I did my duty. Served my country. Your action has been approved, Sir. Is the curfew...to be kept on? -What time is it? -6 am, Sir! Keep it on. Announce a relaxation at 8 am. They will need to bury and burn their dead. Yes, Sir. Captain! Is it quiet out there? Yes, Sir. What I experienced that night... is known only to me and the one above. When I turned 18... my teacher said to me... that, "Son... youth... is a gift of God. It's up to you whether you let it wither or give it meaning." When I see him up there, I shall ask did I give my youth meaning? Or did I let it go to waste? Is there anything I can do for you? Yes. Let the world know, I was a revolutionary! [Moaning and crying] Stretcher... Saline... Chloroform... Clean the equipment. Son... he... he is no more! [Moans] I'll need more tinctures. How are you? Couple of months have gone now... come back. You must ask for a pardon. You will live. It’s time to... meet my friend. Please Udham. That's time, miss! Time. -Sir... -Yes. They had defied section 144. Martial law and curfew were already in place. Those who were assembled in Jallianwala Bagh, knew they had violated the law. And you decided that you would fire onto the crowd? Yes! I went with the deliberate intention of opening fire if I found a crowd assembled there. Supposing the passage was sufficient for the armoured cars to go in... would you have fired with the machine guns? I think probably, yes! And in that case the casualties would have been much higher? Yes! If General Dyer had not dispersed that crowd by force... we would have had an infinitely worse state of rebellion. Don’t you think that the firing went on for too long? My responsibility... was that if I fire, I must fire with good effect. A small amount of firing is a criminal act! I was going to punish them. My idea was to make a wide strong impression. I was going to teach them a lesson.
