Remember me, Elvis Moreau? I used to Play on your baseball team, the Cubs. I was the lame-o you used to shout at every time I dropped a fly ball, which was pretty much any time one was hit in my direction. - [bell ringing] - It sucked. But you know what really sucked? Was you... and your big stinking mouth. I can still hear you howling from the dugout. [clicking] Who's got the last laugh now, asshole? [machines whirring] Hmm? All right, now. Say cheese. [shutter clicks] [organ music playing "Take me out to the ballgame"] [knocking] Woman: Excuse me. Mr. Moreau? - Mrs. Van hook. - Elvis. I came by to thank your father for the lovely job he did on my husband. Thank you, ma'am. I'll be sure to tell him. Is he around today? Oh, no, ma'am, he's... he's occupied at the moment. I hardly see him anymore at church since your momma passed. - Mmm. - Is he all right? Oh, he's fine. he's just fine. Thank you for asking. He certainly did a marvelous job. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. [ball droPs in hole] Whoo-hoo! [Whistles] [soft music Playing on radio] - How'd you do? - [rock music playing] - 78. - [soft music playing] That's great.

Dumpling, squinch up to your mom so I can fit everything in. Just take the picture already! We're gonna be late. Don't call me dumpling. Jimmy, how hard can it be? Anabelle: Just take it, Jimmy! Smile. [beeping softly] Oh, shit, somebody's coming. Smile, princess, and don't say "shit." Creepy. Did y'all get a look at those two? [shutter clicks] Okay, which one you want? Colored or regular? Well, hmm. All right, how about big ones? I know you like the big ones. Well... Okay, how about this? While you decide, I'm gonna go get dinner. - You want anything? - Moon pie. Moon Pie? All right. - Elvis? - Yeah? Don't forget the moon pie. I heard you. I heard you. [grunting] [mocking] You like marshmallows? I like marshmallows too. I like marshmallows. Hey, man, sorry, is there a problem? - No, there ain't no problem. - No problem? Good. Come on. Freak. [beeping] [silent] Dad. The flowers. [Wind whistling] ♪ Marry me, marry me ♪ ♪ Please marry me. ♪ I hate to break the news to you folks, but Anabelle and I have decided to eloPe. [laughing] It took a lot of convincing, but he finally agreed. [laughing] Let's get together and give her a big hand and send her off with our best wishes. Come on. Oh, thank you! [band Playing] Hi, how are you? Good to see you. [vomits] [knocking] Just a minute, please. [Water running] [gargling, sPits] [typewriter keys clicking] "Baron von Cleopart heard the man screaming outside the door of his castle. He could feel the anger coursing through their veins as they collectively lunged at the large doors. He calmly moved to the top of the stairs..." [clears throat] "...and watched them scurry toward him like a pack of rats. They stopped in their tracks as he opened his cloak and unsheathed a long shiny sword." See, I'm not sure if he should use a sword or one of those long poles with a hatchet on the end. You know what I mean? Which one you think? I like it. Maybe I'll give him knives on the inside of his cloak. I like it. I like it too. When you gonna get a gal? When you gonna get a gal? I heard you the first time. Um... I don't know. I haven't met anyone. You ain't gonna find her in the grocery store. [chuckles] Your company does me just fine. I wouldn't mind having a grandbaby running around making a mess. I'd like having me a little grandbaby running around making a mess here and there. - I heard you. - You mad at me? No. No, Dad, I'm not mad at you. I like your story, Elvis. I like you, Dad. I like you more, Elvis. I'm gonna go to my room and work on this some more. You need anything? - Night, son. - All right. You change your mind, just holler. Night. Night. Okay, arms back, chest out. Oh my God, did you pack the miracle bra? No, Momma, I decided to go topless for the evening gown competition. Stop cutting up. Did you bring it? Of course I did, Momma. Not that your breasts need a miracle. My God, you are so beautiful. Get over here, right now. Hey, you have to carry yourself with that confidence. Momma, you saw Miss Panhandle. She was gorgeous. She's nothing. She's nothing. Repeat it. "L am the most beautiful girl." "I am the most beautiful girl." "Pure as the driven snow." Say it. Oh, Momma. Please. What? Well, you are... right? Am what? Nothing. I don't even have to ask. I know. [knocking] Baby, I can't find your curling iron anywhere. It's in the blue bag. You look. How you doing? Got butterflies in your belly? Little bit. How 'bout a good luck hug? Huh? Come on. Come on. Come on. That's it. You're gonna be fine. Just fine. Right? Yeah. Hey. You kick ass out there now. [door shuts] Well? [laughing] I love you. Oh, God knows it hasn't been easy, but I tried to show you a better world. It's all right, Momma. No. No, it is not all right. You listen to me. This moment, right here, this can change your life. Do you get that? We're talking lunches with the governor and scholarships and modeling contracts... the works. I mean, true freedom. That means never having to count on some jackass of a man like... like your stepfather for your happiness. That's what it means. But only if... and I mean only if... you truly believe you can win. So do you? I do. All right. Now you get out there, baby, and you shine. You shine, shine, shine. - [music Playing] - [audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, let's have a big round of applause for our contestants. Aren't they beautiful? Let me tell you guys, am I the luckiest man alive or what? Two minutes, ladies. Just slow down, Momma, you're gonna rip it! Your tummy is bloated. Hurry. Excuse me. Anabelle, if you could have one wish come true, what would that be? If I could have one wish, it would be that I could save all the abandoned children of the world from neglect. - [applause] - Thank you. [music Playing] [singing oPera in ltalian] That means Miss Panhandle and Miss Cameron County, one of you will win a $50,000 scholarship, the crown, and a chance to compete in the national pageant. Woman: Ladies, hold tight. - [drumroll] - The first runner uP is Miss Panhandle! - [cheering] - Man: Miss Texas Rose, Anabelle Leigh! Woman: They're waiting for you, Anabelle! Go up on your floor. Reporter:. A night of pageantry turned into tragedy. We don't have a whole lot of details so far on exactly what happened. However, what I can tell you at this hour is that miss Anabelle leigh was pronounced dead at 1:00 Am. Doctors determined her cause of death was a cardiac arrest due to complications from an eating disorder. As we get more details about what happened... [TV shuts off] Come on, Dad. Let's go to bed. [sniffs] We... We had her frozen. We were gonna check into cryogenics. Honey, we said we weren't gonna bring that up. I don't wanna bring it up. We heard your father is one of the... best embalmers around. I'm afraid he wasn't available for this appointment, but I'm the funeral director, and I'll certainly relay any requests you might have. Did you know Anabelle? No. No, ma'am. I did not. I reckon y'all would've... spent time in different circles. All I ask... is that you make her beautiful one last time. Absolutely. I can guarantee you that. [Wind whistling] [wind blowing stronger] [shutter clicks] [thunderclap] [gagging, coughing] [softly] Oh my God. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. Holy shit. [soft thumping] [muttering] [softly] She's alive. She's alive. She's alive. She's alive! She's alive. She's alive. Dad, wake up. Wake up. Dad: What's the ruckus? Hello? I have an emergency. I'm at the Moreau funeral home. I'm a mortician. I was embalming this girl... my Dad was embalming a girl. She suddenly woke up. Who woke up? I'm up Route 409, I'm in Coward, Texas. Am I what? Lady, I ain't fooling. Send paramedics, send an ambulance, send something. Bye. Okay, Dad, listen. What's all the commotion? I was working on Miss Texas Rose and she just suddenly popped up. I don't think she's dead. - Miss Texas Rose is here? - I told you that earlier. Where's your suit? We need to get you changed. - Okay. Ow! - [groaning] You gotta tell them you were working and she came back to life. - Understand? - Who came back to life? - Miss Texas Rose. - Oh. Okay. We need to make you look all nice. - Why? - TV crew's coming. - I'm gonna be on TV? - [all shouting] She... woke up. Woman: Did she say anything? What were her first words? She just woke up... and her heart was beating. It's not the first time this has happened. In 2002, Charlotte Jenkins laid six hours in a body bag in the morgue of st. Cloud's hospital before an attendant noticed the bag was moving around. In the case of Anabelle leigh, because the body was frozen in what must've been a comatose state... [continuing on TV] Miss Leigh, Anabelle needs to rest. Her body's been through an incredibly difficult ordeal. I'm sure you understand, she's gonna have to take some time to recover before she can go out in public. So if you don't mind? Right? You better believe it. Momma's gonna take good care of her little baby. - Anabelle! - [all shouting] [camera shutter clicks] [dull, echoing] Look at me. Look this way. Look here, look here. Look at me. Come on, look at the lens! [shutter clicks] She's gonna be back in five minutes. We're just gonna take a little break, okay? Would you mind? Thank you. Thank you. Okay, Channel 5 called, they want to do a piece on you. - Aren't you excited? - Mmm. And are you ready for the icing? Guess who called about a half hour ago? - Marilyn Manson. - Marilyn...? - I don't know, Momma. Who? - Oprah. They want to fly us first class to Chicago to be on the show. Geneva, I don't wanna go on "Oprah." Are you... are you crazy? This is... Geneva? Princess, why on Earth are you calling me that? 'Cause that's your name? My name is Momma. And my name's Anabelle. Oh. hey, y'all, do you guys mind if I join in? - Anabelle. - I haven't done this in a long time. - Oop! - Anabelle. [giggling] Announcer on tv: Coming up next "real America," a miraculous story of tragedy and triumph. A small town beauty queen comes back to life on an embalming table afer collapsing on stage just seconds afer being crowned "miss texas rose." [TV shuts off] I'd Put money down she thinks she's God's gift to mankind. Royal pain in the ass, I'm telling you. [doorbell ringing] I'll be right back. - [knocking] - Coming. - Hey. - Hi. Um, I'm looking for Charlie. Mr. Moreau. You were just on TV. Oh, yeah. So where's Mr. Moreau? He's occupied at the moment... Charlie. Charlie's my Dad. Can I help you? Actually, I need to talk to him. It's... do you know who I am? You were just on TV. That's right. So where does he do the embalming? Inside, why? Can I see? - I don't think so. - Okay. Maybe I'll just come back when Charlie's available. He's Pretty busy these days. I'm sorry, do I know you? Me? No. I swear, you just... you look so familiar. Did you go to Edison? Mmm-hmm. I'll tell him you came by. Okay. And tell him I won't take much of his time. Okay. Okay. Bye. I'll see you then. I'm Elvis, by the way. My name is Elvis. Oh. Really? Anabelle. I know. That's right. - Bye. - Bye. Woman: How are her eating habits? She's been eating like a horse. - Oh, good for her. - Not good. She keeps going on like this she's gonna be competing in "Miss Large and Tall." It's just not like her to take off without saying anything. - Where could she have gone? - Near deathers often have a deep-seated need to alter their lives. - Anabelle! - Anabelle! Anabelle! [all shouting] Anabelle: Leave me alone! - [door shuts] - [Anabelle groans] They're driving me crazy! Anabelle! Anabelle, this is Dr. Putnam. We asked her to stop by. I can't go anywhere in this stupid town without somebody taking my picture. But you love to have your picture taken. Ma, I can't take this! I just... I can't do it anymore. - I'm done! - Good idea. Good idea. Why don't you get some rest? Tomorrow's another day. We got "Good Morning, houston" coming at 8:00. I said no more interviews! We told them we'd do it! You told them! Don't do this to me! [sighs] - Mom: Smile! - Jimmy: Smile, honey. - Smile, princess. - That a girl. Beautiful. For the camera. That a girl. Smile! You look beautiful. Pretty girl. That's it. Good girl. [gasPs, Panting] [gasPs] Oh my God! Good Lord, you scared the crap outta me! Jesus Christ, what are you doing here? How'd you get in? I'm sorry. Would you put that thing down? You don't walk into people's houses like that. Just calm down, okay? It's not like I was stealing anything. What are you doing here? What? I just wanted to see if I could remember. Remember what? What? This is where it happened, isn't it? I guess, but call or something. Let us know you're coming over. Sorry. It's okay. Did you remember anything? It's kinda hard when you're about to be bludgeoned with a golf club. Hello. Hey, Dad, it's okay. You can go back to bed. You're Mr. Moreau? Hello. You remember Anabelle? Have we met? My name is Charlie. Okay. Can you just excuse us for one second? Hey. Dad, this is the girl... The one I talked to you about. The one who came back to life on the table. - She is a foxy mama. - She wants to ask you some questions about what happened. - When? - Dad, I don't have my embalming license, remember? Oh, I understand. Yeah, so just go back to bed. Let me talk to her. - Okay. - I'll go, I'll go. I'm sorry about him. He's got some sleepwalking problems. You just woke up. You just woke up and your heart was beating. You sure are pretty. - Ain't she pretty, Elvis? - You look tired, Dad. Let's get you to bed. I guess I'll go back up to bed. Yeah, it was a long day. I guess that's all he remembers. His memory's kinda whacked. Okay. So you should probably get going. Guess I'll just take off then. Yeah. It's so dark. It's 4:30 in the morning. There was a moon earlier, smarty pants. Do you want a ride? Oh, it's fine. I don't want you to go out of your way or anything. Is it okay if I at least come inside and wait an hour or so until the sun comes up? I guess. Thank you. Who are they? That's my Granddaddy and my Great Granddaddy. The kid's my Dad. All morticians? Yup. Is that what you're gonna do? Yup. Here. Thank you. - You gonna eat? - I'm not hungry. [footsteps on stairs] Thanks for breakfast. And again, I'm sorry for intruding. It's okay. - Bye. - Take care. You too. I don't wanna go. I can't go home. Why not? Because... I just can't, that's why. Look, I just need to disappear for a while... from everybody I know. What, here? Don't you have like a barn or someplace I can hide out? Just for a few days. We don't have a barn. [clears throat] I don't think that's a very good idea. Okay. I'll just find a motel or someplace. Bye now. Wait. Come on... inside. Are you sure? No. Thank you. [footsteps approaching] Hey. Hey. These are beautiful. Yeah, they belonged to my mom. These are some of my old clothes. I think they'll fit. Thank you. Okay. I'll leave you to change. Okay. So I didn't make a noise or say anything or anything like that? Nothing at all. You just woke up. That's it? You woke up and you stretched your arms. And yawned. That's it. Wait... nothing, it's fine. [soft voices] It's fine, it just doesn't make sense. You just said something completely different. You said I sat up. It just doesn't make sense. - Hi. - Hey, I thought you had work to do. I thought you were gonna stay in the den. What the hell are you doing out here? I asked you to stay in the house. My Dad, he isn't well, all right? - I'm sorry. - She's a good little golfer. Come on, son. Show her how the Moreau boys play golf. All right, gimme the club. Who-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Ooh, nice one, Charlie. Your Dad's precious. Is he okay? Yeah, he's fine. A couple of years back some kids from Madison threw a beer bottle at his head while he was walking on the side of the road. Friends of yours, I'm sure. Wait, friends of mine? How's that? Bobby Jackson, Johnny Parker... that crew. Aren't you all buddy buddy? No. Why would you think that? You were a cheerleader, weren't you? So does that mean all my friends are jerks? Doesn't it? You know what? Your Dad is such a sweetheart and you're just such a... somebody should hit you in the head with a beer bottle, get you to lighten up a little. Good Lord. See that, Elvis? I shot a 74. I heard you already. What'd you get? He got 100... on the front nine. [laughing] Hear that Elvis? You got 100... on the front nine. Okay, that's enough. I think I'm gonna go inside and rest a spell. Thanks for the golf game, Charlie. Nothing to it. I'll be right in. So you help your father with... his prep work. I'm still training. So you didn't see the whole thing that happened with me? No, I was asleep. Your Dad can still work? Doing all that mortician stuff? Mm-hmm. The doctor said his brain's like a bike chain with a few missing links. It slips off the sprocket and he forgets things. Hmm. Any reason this place looks so spooky? Spooky? It just doesn't look cared for. How 'bout a coat of Paint? It'd be better for business I think. We have all the business we can handle. We're the only funeral home for 50 miles. It just looks like death. Nobody's making you stay. Hey, I'm sorry. Elvis, I didn't mean... [sighs] Oh. [sniffs] Where is she? [razor buzzing] [metal clanking] [razor shuts off] What the hell are you doing? Don't do that. I'm over it all ready. Come on down. Where'd you get the paint from? Garage. I'm gonna need some more. [razor buzzing] What? "The baron had thrown his last dagger, but the men kePt coming. He flew uP the stairs, his black caPe flowing behind him. He dashed into Analisa's room..." Wait. Where did she come from, Elvis? She wasn't in the villa the other night. I told you twice. He saw her hanging out there. "She looked petrified, but she kePt on running." [shutter clicks] [gasPs] Good Lord! Do you always have to creep up on people like that?! Only people who snoop around without permission. Look, I wasn't snooping, okay? I was just... Iooking around. Why are you so obsessed with this place? Because... I don't know, I keep having these weird dream flashback things where I start to remember what happened here and then it just... it goes away. The feeling I get... you have no idea. [Wind whistling] Is that your Mom? Mm-hmm. She's beautiful. You look just like her. She made that kite. Really? So how did... how did she and your Dad...? What was she doing with a hunchback? I didn't mean it like that? It's okay. My Dad didn't always look like this. His back was barely bent when she met him. Look, we should probably get outta here. My Dad doesn't like people snooping around. I'm gonna watch TV, if you wanna come? Okay. Okay. Why do you beat my son so hard? He's a beast, an animal. Some day I shall have to destroy him. - [laughing] - My poor son. Why was he ever born? You can stop now. I've got three more walls to go. ♪ this is the first day of my life ♪ ♪ swear I was born right in the doorway ♪ ♪ I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed ♪ ♪ they're spreading blankets on the beach... ♪ Nice shirt. What's wrong with it? Nothing, I said it's nice. Here, let me see it. [laughing] Anabelle: I've never seen anything that can't be fixed with a little white paint. [laughing] ♪ But I realized that I need you ♪ ♪ And I wondered if I could come home ♪ ♪ mm-hmm ♪ ♪ mm-hmm ♪ ♪ this is the first day of my life ♪ ♪ I'm glad I didn't die before I met you... ♪ ♪ I'm glad I didn't die before I met you... ♪ What? Morning. Thought you'd wanna see this. What? Missing? God. She knows I ran away. It says authorities throughout the state are on alert. Oh, great. What if they come 'round here? What would I be doing here? Wait, that's not what I mean. Elvis. You ever grow anything in that field? Nothing grows worth a damn 'round here. It's shitty dirt. What do you use that tractor and planter for? Golf course. I can't believe it. We are doing this ass-backwards. We need to be planting the seeds now so they can grow while we paint. Can you lend me some money? Wait, what seeds? You can't plant anything now. What's gonna grow in the heat? A miracle. Can I help you, ma'am? Yes, sir, I need about 10 bags of these, please. Dusty, load up. You out at the Moreau place? I seen you pull up in the hearse with Elvis. Yes, sir, I'm Charlie's niece. Charlie's niece? That's right. Helping them clean that dump up. They'll check you out right over there. Thank you. Finally. Get everything you need? Yup. You? Yup. Took you long enough. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that your Dad? Shit. He's my stepdad. You'd never know it after he gets a few drinks in him. [engine starting] [engine stoPs] Would you get back to painting or something? I mean it, you're making me nervous. - [engine starts] - What are you doing? Whoa. What's she planting? I don't know. She went in the Feed and Seed and got a bunch of seed bags. Made me Promise not to Peek. Can't grow nothing but weeds in this heat. I already told her. She said she was in some 4h club at school. Nothing but weeds. Holler at me when you see her come back to the house. I don't want her to see me working. I'm gonna keep up the good work. That's right. Good to see you there, Charlie. I have nothing to say to you. [speaks Spanish] About to go crazy looking for that missing beauty queen. You doing all right after she came back to life on you like that? I'm doing all right. Hey, Elvis. - Hey. - Hey. I'm just talking to your Daddy here. - You doing all right? - He's doing all right. Uh-huh. Y'all ain't seen no trace of Anabelle around here, right? No. Is that a yes or a no? That's a no. Who's that boy on the tractor? That's Arturo. He's new. He wanted to Plant some corn, I think? Corn? Ain't no corn gonna grow now. No, that's right. Ain't no corn gonna grow now. That what we said to Arturo. Didn't we, Elvis? We said, "Arturo, you can have the crop if anything grows." The whole croP we told him. He's from GuadaluPe. But he was raised in Zihuatanejo. He said they grow lots of corn in Zihuatanejo. All year long. I don't like corn myself. It gets stuck in my teeth unless Elvis cuts the kernels off for me. If y'all see that girl anywhere, you give us a call. - Sure thing. - All right. Sure thing. Pew! How did you do that? I figured you learned your storytelling from somebody. You amaze me. Whoa, sorry. It's okay. What's up? Nothing. You see that cop? Yeah. Told you nobody'd recognize me. What if he did? I'm not worried about it. Why should you? I don't want to be an accessory or accomplice or whatever. You didn't kidnap me. I'm staying here on my own free will. If you want me to leave, it's fine, just say it. No, it's not that. It's you just... you can't be out here in the oPen... on the tractor, painting the house, hosing yourself down. - Hosing you down. - Hey. - [laughing] - Think this is funny? - Think you're funny? - I think I am hilarious. You do? Good Lord, he laughs! A genuine laugh. I don't believe it. Somebody get a camera quick! "She believed this was the only way to rid the sorrow. Regrets to her were something holding you back from the future." Can I see it? I'll read you the rest tomorrow night. Good night. Are you gonna marry her? Am I gonna...? Dad, I only just met her. If you want to move out with her, it's okay. Your Aunt haley can move in. I'm not going anywhere. You could both live here if you want. You can have my room. Dad, what are you talking about? Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong? You are my favorite boy in the whole world. - Come here. - My favorite boy. I love you too, Dad. You okay? I'm okay. Okay. Try and get some sleep. I'm okay, Elvis. Good. - Elvis. - Yes. - I'm okay. - Okay. Hi. Hey. I couldn't find any other clothes to wear. Is it okay if I wear this? Yeah. It looks good on you. Thanks. I heard you reading that story to your Dad. It's just a stupid thing I've been working on. You wrote that? Yeah. Wow. You think maybe I could read it sometime? Sure. It's not very good, but you can read it. So what are you gonna do? Now? Nothing. I was gonna... watch some TV or something. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Do you wanna go out? We could see a movie or something. Maybe in like, Timmonsville or something like that? Someplace we won't run into people I know. We'll run into people you know. Okay, fine. You wanna go for a walk? I'd go for a walk. Okay. See that spot right there? That's where they found my mom. I'm so sorry. Why'd she do it? I don't know. She was tired, I guess... of people or something. How old were you? 12. - Mmm. - My father, he just lost it after that. He started taking these long walks all the time... mumbling to himself. It was right around then the kids threw a bottle at him. Nothing but assholes 'round here. I'm sorry. [sighs] Damn, I haven't looked at the stars in a long time. Anabelle: Isn't it amazing? Here we are, lying on this big ol' ball of planet, spinning round and round in space. All these stars floating next to us. Nobody even thinks twice about it. I don't know. After all the terrible stuff that happened to me... it made me realize that for every terrible tragedy in this world, there's an equally miraculous thing that grows from it. You know? I can hear you smirking. Let's just say the shit outweighs the miracles around here. Hmm. Oh yeah? Well, then, hit me with some shit. Mother offing herself on Christmas day. There's one. Christmas? Yeah, it's a popular day for suicide. I'm so sorry. I'm so... I can't do this. What? Nothing. It's not you, Elvis. [scoffs] Whatever. Look, I mean it. You just proved my point. [car approaching] Get down, get down. Elvis: Oh, shit. [door oPens] Oh, I'm sorry, Elvis. I'm so sorry. - Dad, it's okay. - They said they knew she was here and I might as well admit it so nobody gets hurt and goes to jail. - You did good. - I did? Of course you did. - Listen, I'm gonna take off. - Wait, wait, wait. - How? - My bike. I have a friend that lives in Padre lsland. I'm sure she wouldn't mind if I stay a few days. No, you're not riding your bike. It's fine. I'll take the back roads. - Where did you tell 'em we were? - I just told 'em Anabelle had been here, but then she took off in our Cadillac. - What Cadillac? - The one parked up alongside the house. Dad, we don't have a Cadillac. They don't know that. [laughs] Listen, I really should get going. - Thank you both. - No, let me figure this out. - It's okay. You go. - You sure? Please. I have everything I need right here, I do. I don't wanna leave you alone. It's okay, son. You go ahead. It's all right. I love you. - Come on. - Thank you, Charlie. Thank you so much for everything. - Bye. - You take care of him. Hey, what's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. [sighs] I just had so much fun at your place. [soft music Playing on radio] Then it hit me... I haven't lived. I mean, really lived... enjoyed one day in my entire stupid life. Who has? Here. Why don't you use this here? Thank you. [blowing nose] I'm sorry. You ever thought about doing what your mom did? You know, offing yourself like that? Sure. Who hasn't? No, I mean really thought about it. No. I could never do that to my father. You ever even think of it, I don't care where I am, you call me, okay? I don't care what I'm doing. Promise me that. You really think you're gonna give a shit about me after you take off? [scoffs] You know what? You can be so cool and then be such a jerk. Fine, whatever. Keep thinking your depressed and shitty thoughts. You'll have a depressing, shitty life. What do I care? ♪ love comes at dawn... ♪ Charlie said she borrowed a car of theirs and took off. He said they didn't say anything earlier 'cause they promised Anabelle. Let's search the Place. Judge won't give us a search warrant for a runaway. Who says she's a runaway? You said so yourself. This makes no sense. From what y'all been telling me, she ain't done nothing that makes any sense lately. Am I right? [Waves crashing] [urinating] [engine starts] What are you doing? [Pats hood] Open the door. Open the door. Say you're sorry. Sorry for what? Being a jerk last night. - I'm sorry. - Like you mean it. Open the door, Anabelle. Guess I'm leaving. Okay, I'm sorry for acting like a jerk last night. Actually, jerk's too nice a word. - Asshole? - Keep going. Anabelle, open the goddamn door already. Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I was an asshole. - You were. Okay, I'm driving. Come on, get in. So what is your friend like? - My friend? - Padre lsland friend. The one we came to see. Oh, I don't know anybody that lives down here. Then what are we doing down here? Whoa, where are we going? I decided we're going to the beach. Stop. What are we doing? Come on, it'll be fun. Whooo! Jesus Christ, woman, what are you doing? Come on, try it. - No. - Do it. I swear you'll feel so much better. - No, I don't want to. - How fast you think this thing'll go? I don't know, 5, 10? You have a nice smile. Anybody ever tell you that? - Don't look at me, look at the road. - What road?! Whooo!

I don't really wanna talk about it. Then don't. If you could do anything in the whole world, what would it be? No idea. Come on, quick, just say the first thing that comes to mind. I like writing horror novels. But I don't know if I'm very good at it. Oh come on. I bet you'd be great. So why are you training to be a mortician then? Is that something you really wanna do? Not everybody gets to do what they wanna do. There are responsibilities in life. Ohh, what are you responsible for? A lot of things. My dad. Taking care of the family business.

Where are you taking him? [Anabelle sobbing] Come on over here. Watch your head there, son. Watch your head. Elvis. So you collected these pictures of dead people. Mmm. Goddamn, Elvis, whatever happened to baseball cards? You never violated any of these corpses? I only took pictures. Look, I know you're not gonna believe me... Who said I don't believe you? There's no law against taking photographs of dead people. The only question I have... is about that one right there. Yeah, it's... it's a long story. I got nothing but time. Tonight on "texas in view," we unearth the shocking details behind the story of Elvis moreau, a necrophiliac mortician and Anabelle leigh, a resurrected beauty queen, and the reigning miss texas rose. "Texas in view" brings you exclusive in-depth analysis of how a seemingly innocent teenager, - once a model son, - I don't care what that boy did to you. - ...became a deranged monster. - None of it matters anymore. You're home... and you're safe. While neighbors described Charlie moreau and son Elvis as standoffish... [camera shutter clicks] [knocking] These events have shot tremors of disgust and distrust throughout the community. - [reporters shouting] - Oh, no. - No, no. - That's it. - Get on out of here. - I'm gonna call the police. We've got nothing to say today. - Go on. Go on home. - Go away. I wanna know what happened. Everything. You already know what happened. I'm a crazed necrophiliac. I have sex with geriatrics. Stop it! I wanna know the truth. I'm not gonna press charges. Fine. Okay. You can go now. I want you to go home and take care of your father. What do you care about my father? Elvis, I'm gonna tell you this, and then I don't ever wanna see you again. I think deep inside you're an incredible person. But you just need some help. Please. Elvis, you have had so much help from me. - What do you know about me? - I know you! Now you're gonna analyze my life?! You have no idea what happened... what I did or didn't do! Tell me. What's the point? I thought you were so much more than this. Join the club. No, you know what? Fuck you! God, I am so sick of your victim crap! Yeah, I know people have made mistakes that have hurt you or scarred you or whatever. But here you turn around and you do the same thing to me... to somebody that you acted like you cared about. But am I gonna make that the focus of the rest of my life? No. You know why? Because I chose to forgive and move on. I kissed you. What? I was doing the embalming. My father, he can't do it anymore. You were lying on the table in the room. I looked at you... and you looked so... beautiful. And I kissed you. I didn't do anything more than that to you or anyone. I have a camera in the room. I use it to take Pictures of the people after I finish embalming them. I didn't mean to take a Picture of us. That was an accident. I would've told you what happened before... but I figured I'd end up right where I am. When I came back on the table, were you there? I was about to start embalming and you moved. You sat up. After you kissed me? Yeah. Anabelle... I... you wanna know what the saddest thing is, Elvis? After all that, you still didn't believe in miracles. Maybe you're right. [reporters shouting] Whoo-hoo! Dad? Dad! Dad. Wake up. [groans] HelP me! HelP me! [sobbing] Wake up. Wake up, Daddy. [Wind whistling] [Phone ringing] Yes. I'll Pick him uP. [knocking] Elvis. Russ Williams, News 25.
