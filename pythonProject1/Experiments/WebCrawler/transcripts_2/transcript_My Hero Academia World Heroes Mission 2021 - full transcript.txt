foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- [FLECT] Why were superhuman powers, the meta abilities known so casually as Quirks, forced upon our kind? Why was the first met a human... The Shining Baby... born unto us? These Quirks bring about nothing but tragedy. They are not a blessing on our world, but the beginning of its end. It is foretold in the Quirk Doomsday Theory. As generations pass, powers mix and evolve. Eventually, none will be able to control their abilities. In this hour of need, 80 percent of humanity is sick with Quirks. How many of the remaining pure humans will have relations with Quirk holders? Spawning even more who are cursed with this blight. Our extinction is nigh at hand. We, Humarise, must take action. Even if it means dying the earth red with blood, that will simply be our righteous burden to bear. For humanity's salvation. [HUMARISE MEMBERS] For humanity's salvation. For humanity's salvation. For humanity's salvation. For humanity's salvation. For humanity's salvation. For humanity's salvation. Now then. Let us begin. [CROWD screams] [yelps] [screams] [CITIZEN B screaming] [CITIZEN C groans] [screams] [screaming] [CITIZEN D screams] [CROWD screaming] [HUMARISE MEMBER AA] Ah, hello there. It seems you don't have a Quirk. Congratulations. You are one of the chosen who's been saved. [WHA DIRECTOR] The group claiming responsibility for the recent attack is known as Humarise. This radical sect was founded by Flect Turn and seeks to save humanity from the so-called Quirk Doomsday Theory. The attack used a Quirk-activating substance known as Ideotrigger that was spread through the streets via devices we're dubbing Trigger Bombs. [WHA DIRECTOR] The mission of the Hero team we've gathered is to search the 25 known Humarise complexes so that these bombs can be destroyed. Intelligence suggests there's one device at each location. Arrest any Humarise members present and neutralize the payload. Be advised you should expect heavy resistance. They may detonate the bombs once they realize we're moving. As such, we're not asking local law enforcement to assist. This is the most urgent mission many of you have ever faced. All Might. [ALL MIGHT] Heroes, the success or failure of this task rests on your shoulders. Let's give smiles back to citizens who're frightened by terrorism! [WHA DIRECTOR] This is it, heroes. Start your missions! Team A. No matter what happens, collect the Trigger Bomb before it can be set off! [HEROES] Roger that! [IZUKU] There. Humarise's Otheon headquarters. [TODOROKI] While they handle the weapon, we're to take the facility and capture their leader, Flect. Don't let your guards down, Team B. [KATSUKI] What, you think we'd forget all that? Shut up! [HUMARISE MEMBER A] Stay back! [HUMARISE MEMBER BB] We won't let you past us! [ENDEAVOR] This is what resistance gets you. Clair. Track down the device. I'm on it. Voyance! [HUMARISE MEMBER B] They're violating our sanctuary! [HUMARISE MEMBERS groan] [TODOROKI] Bakugo, most of their members are Quirkless! Don't be too rough. Yeah. I know. Stun Grenade! [yells] [HUMARISE MEMBERS groan] Endeavor, there's something wrong. I can't find the bomb anywhere! What's that? Where's Flect? We're about to close in on him. [ENDEAVOR] Once he's captured, make him tell you where the bomb is! [PANKRATION] Roger! [IZUKU] Flect Turn is in that room. [PANKRATION] Damn it! Their leader's gone! Search the premises! [IZUKU] In the end, even though we raided the Humarise buildings around the world, we couldn't find a single Trigger Bomb. [HAWKS] Yeah. We interrogated the members we rounded up. But it's no use. They've got no clue where the devices are being kept. Doesn't seem like they even knew the things existed. It's the same for members from the other branches, too. My guess? It's likely that the recent attack was carried out by a smaller internal group directly under the control of Flect Turn. [ALL MIGHT] Director, there might be another facility that we don't know about. They must have guessed that we were coming and moved the bombs in anticipation. All teams stand by in your respective locations. We're going to send in more heroes to find Humarise's secret base! [ALAN panting] [ALAN] I have to deliver this. If I don't, the world will be destroyed! [RODY] Roro. Lala. It's about time for me to head off to work. You know what to do. [BOTH] We'll study bunches! And if it turns out I'm not gonna be home till late? [BOTH] We'll make dinner for ourselves! [RODY] Mm. 'Kay, but... What if a weirdo shows up and tries to stalk ya, huh? [RORO, LALA] We'll pretend nobody's home! Yeah? [RORO, LALA] Yeah! Don't worry, though, I doubt today's gig is gonna take that long anyway. [BOTH] Okay! Pino! All right, I'll catch ya kiddos later. [RORO, LALA] Have a good day! [RODY] Old man, you got a lead for me? [STANLEYK] Pickup's on East Third Street. Be quick about it. The package needs to be delivered to the Chinese restaurant in South Grove. [RODY] How much cash are we talking? Heh. Like you're in a position to negotiate fees. You'll take the regular rate and do it with a smile. [chirps] [RODY] Okay. I'm on it. Done before you know it. What are you... that's my bike! You stole it from someone else. I'll give it back to its rightful owner later! [STANLEYK] You can't just take whatever you want, damn punk! [RODY] C'mon. Let's get this over with. [PINO coos] [IZUKU] Whoa! The streets are so busy! Yeah, well, I guess it is the biggest city in Otheon. [sighs] Being told to wait on standby is one thing. But since when do I get treated like an errand boy? It's because we're the lowest ranking members in our group. Huh?! [TODOROKI] The only reason we got called up in the first place is because we're doing our work studies at Endeavor's Agency. We're basically freebies that were thrown in. Still. We have a huge responsibility here. Our job is to protect the world from Humarise. And we will find them. We'll make sure of it. The stupid organization is full of obsessed idiots. Why do they believe the Quirk Doomsday Theory? They're taking a totally hypothetical idea and using it to justify their crimes. [JEWELRY STORE OWNER A] Those thieves robbed my jewelry shop! Somebody stop them! Aw, hell. Heroes! Catch up with you at the spot. [VILLAIN A] I'll leave the case to you! [KATSUKI] You chase the other one! [IZUKU] Got it! [VILLAIN B] Move! Move! Get outta my way now! [screams] Black whip! [IZUKU] Todoroki! Stop him! [TODOROKI] Leave it to me! [VILLAIN A laughs] That'll teach ya. [KATSUKI] What a pathetic blast! I'll show you what a real one looks like! [VILLAIN A screams] [CAT A yowls] This is taking too long. My contact better not be a no-show. [CITIZEN DD screams] Here! [RODY] Wait. What? [VILLAIN B chuckles] Not gonna work on me. [TODOROKI] That took longer than expected. [IZUKU] Todoroki! [TODOROKI] Midoriya. The case is gone. Did he get rid of it? [IZUKU] There's a third! [cars honk] [IZUKU] Gotcha! [groans] Stinks to be you. He's already up on the roof? [RODY] I can't shake him. [IZUKU] Black whip! [RODY] Still got it. Hey, knock knock! [IZUKU yelps] Oh, thank you so much! He couldn't have gotten that far away yet, right? Heh. I think it's pretty obvious I'm too smooth for you. You can't catch someone with these moves. [PINO chirps] [grunts] Huh? Whoa! Yikes! [IZUKU] An accident? [TODOROKI] Midoriya! I'll take care of the car crash! [IZUKU] Thanks! [PINO chirping] Hey. We're okay. [RODY] Dang. I'm gonna be late. [PINO chirps] ...Wuh-oh! ...[IZUKU] Wait! [RODY] Hold the door, will ya? [RODY panting] Man. Heck of a day, huh? Aw, jeez. This is my best set of clothes, and now look, they're all scuffed up. That stupid hero. I should send him a dry-cleaning bill. Wait, have we seen him before? Is this town even in his jurisdiction? Oh, well. Don't have to worry about him now, huh? [TRAIN ENGINEER A screams] [BOTH scream] Why exactly did you chase me down? Why were you running from me? I have work to do, so I was in a hurry. What kind of work? I move money. Know what I mean? I may not look it, but I'm a skilled negotiator. So, will you please let me get along with my business? Okay, kid, thanks. So show me what's in the case, and then you're free to go. How much are you offering me? Huh? Y'ask for somethin', it's only natural you should pay for it. I just wanna make sure it's not stolen goods. [RODY] Say, you're not a hero from this country, are you? Is it really okay for you to do hero work in a foreign land if you don't have permission? Well... The thing is... You've got no authority in this city, so maybe rethink your tone, my friend. Or should I tell the police that I was chased down and harassed by a power-hungry hero who had no legal right to detain me? How do you think that's gonna go over, buddy? I'm so glad we could come to this understanding. If you wanna do pro work, I suggest you stay in your own country from now on. Later. [IZUKU] Wait! [RODY] What's your problem? [IZUKU] I told you. I wanna see what's in the case. If you want to see, then flash some cash. Show me and maybe I will. Show me 100,000 eurus. You're out of your mind. ...A quick peek! ...Just let go 'a me! Hands off! [screeches] [yelps] [IZUKU, RODY] Huh? I'm... confused. [POLICE OFFICER A] Good work. [FORENSIC SCIENTIST A] Hey, come over here for a sec! Take a look at these. [POLICE OFFICER A] Where'd they come from? [TODOROKI] Was this an attack? Unfortunate. But so be it. We'll take the necessary precautions. You shall continue tracking it down. [BEROS] Of course. Thank you, sir. [FLECT] Don't forget, Beros. There is only one way for those possessed by the demon of sickness to atone, and that is to give oneself to the cause of saving humanity. [BEROS] I understand. I'm sorry! Please forgive me, I beg of you! [RODY] Jeez! So much for avoiding any kind of scene. Well, I'm just glad that you don't think I'm a criminal anymore. We're good here. I guess even heroes make mistakes and chase after innocent people on occasion. [RODY] Ah, crap, what's going on? This isn't what I signed up for. Wasn't this supposed to be full of jewelry? Oh, no. Don't tell me... [RODY] I mixed up the cases? Anyway, like I said, super busy. You're really sweaty. Do you feel okay? [RODY] Shoot, I need to hurry up and backtrack. But will the case still be there? If someone picked it up and looked at what was inside, there's no way I'm getting it back. I'm dealing with villains here. I can't say, "Oopsy, I lost it." This is bad. What am I gonna do? ...[IZUKU] 'Scuse me. ...[RODY yelps] Are you positive that nothing's wrong with you? Huh? Oh, I'm peachy thanks. ...[IZUKU] Okay then. ...[sirens blare] [RODY] The police? Already? How'd they know to nab me? [POLICE OFFICER B] Hands up and kneel on the ground. Um. Hey, guys! Please just hold on! It's not him. Truth, didn't steal anything! [POLICE OFFICER C] Stop there! We have permission to shoot! Fire! [screams] Hang on and try not to flail. [screams] [RODY screams] [RODY screams] Why would they be using lethal force on you? I thought that I was gonna die. [IZUKU] Someone's after us? [screams] [CROWD clammors] [IZUKU] We can't put bystanders in danger. [RODY] What's happening?! [RODY screaming] [RODY yelping] [sighs] [IZUKU] No! [IZUKU] We have to get somewhere safe. [ENDEAVOR] Idiots! We're right in the middle of an important mission. You should leave the petty criminals for the local authorities to take care of! I thought heroes were supposed to assist those in trouble. You're the one who's supposed to be teaching us. Maybe you should a explained how to ignore crimes. That's not what I said! And Deku? Where'd he run off to? He's following someone who was working with the jewel thieves. But he's not picking up his phone right now. You slackers! I shouldn't have brought you with me even if you are doing your work studies! [TODOROKI] It's him. Midoriya, hey. Do you have the suspect? [IZUKU] Police just attacked us out of nowhere! [gasps] What? Why, what did you do to them? [IZUKU] I don't know! They barely said anything at all before they started firing at us! And when we tried to run away, we were attacked again by someone who looked like a villain. [TODOROKI] Calm down! Tell me everything that happened. Start from the beginning. [IZUKU] Okay, so, I chased the guy who ran away with the case and eventually caught him. But there wasn't any jewelry inside when I opened it up. ...[door clicks] ...[CLAIR] Endeavor. Emergency. It's about Deku. [NEWSCASTER A] Once again, according to recent police reports, the suspect, who is thought to have killed 12 people, is at large and considered by authorities to be highly dangerous. He's a Japanese hero. Uh, called Deku. Real name, Izuku Midoriya. The entire nation is on the lookout. There are also reports that he has an accomplice... [IZUKU] Hello? Hello? Todoroki? Midoriya. What did you really do out there? [IZUKU] What do you mean? Nothing! The news. They're saying you're wanted as a suspect for mass murder. [whispers] No. That makes no sense. What's going on? [TODOROKI] We'll look into it on our end. You stay off the grid for now. They'll track you with GPS. Once you turn off your phone, don't forget to take out the battery. [BOTH yelp] Ugh, don't do that! So, you were able to get in touch with your friends? Wait, what are you doing to your phone? Did they say when they're gonna pick us up? [IZUKU] Yeah. About that. [beeping] We're getting an emergency call from the Otheon team! Deku's been put on the wanted list! [gasps] What did Young Midoriya do? [SHOJI] How could this have happened? I don't know, but according to this, he killed 12 civilians in Otheon. What kind of ridiculous lie is that?! [MT. LADY] But this intel comes from HQ. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! There's no way Midoriya would ever hurt anybody! Guys? No, not a chance. This must be some kinda mistake. It's a false report! [OCHACO] I can't believe it. No way that's true. Deku fights to save people. Something else must be going on here! Ribbit! I'm sure there's an explanation behind all this. I wouldn't worry, girls. Endeavor and the others are on it. Tell me I'm still unconscious. You're a stone-cold murderer, and they think I'm your accomplice? I thought you were supposed to be some kinda hero! Explain yourself! I don't know how we ended up like this. I can't wrap my head around all of it. [RODY] Oh, great. It's all over. Bye-bye life. And here I thought I was already living at rock-bottom. What happens if I fall even lower? Is it even possible? This is all your fault! You dragged me into this mess! [PINO chirps] [RODY] So fix it! That's what heroes do, right? The police fired on us without asking any questions, and then we were attacked by a villain. That tells me that whoever's behind this doesn't care if we're dead or alive. I would suspect they're not really after us. Ah! They must want this! [IZUKU] I don't get it. There's nothing in here that looks incriminating, is there? Wait, what are you doing? You figure they're after this dumb case, right? That's perfect. We'll hand it over and this'll all be put to bed. It's simple as that. Life will just go back to normal. No way, it can't be that easy. If what's in here is so important, then they'd probably wanna silence us even if we did turn it in to them. Hey, don't say that! We're never gonna get anywhere if you're only thinking negative thoughts, buddy. So new plan. Let's destroy the case. Then we can just say "Whoops, it burned up." That's not gonna fix our problems. [RODY] Uh. New-new plan. What if we contact the police? Huh? And say what? [RODY] "If you want the case, then give us 1,000,000 eurus, pronto!" [IZUKU] That would make us real criminals! We need to calm down. [RODY] Are you sure we can't ditch it somewhere? They won't really kill us, right? You're over thinking things. If this case is related to some sort of crime, we can't give it to the bad guys. We might accidentally be helping out real villains. Don't get me involved with your hero sense of justice! [IZUKU] I'm afraid we're already in this together. [gasps] [IZUKU] They wanted to kill us. If we don't know the reason why, then it's dangerous to act rashly. Otherwise we'll end up full of arrows. Or worse. Okay. Then what do you suggest instead? We run for it. [RODY] Huh? [IZUKU] No matter what the situation may be, we can't fight against the police. The people chasing us are Otheon officers. If we cross the border into the neighboring country of Klayd, then they shouldn't be able to follow us. Let's hurry and get out of here before we end up trapped. [RODY] What about the arrow person? A border's not gonna stop a villain. If that happens, then I promise that I'll protect you from them. Huh? [IZUKU] I think getting out of here is our best course of action. Okay, fine, I guess that plan makes as much sense as anything. I'll go to Klayd or wherever you think is best. [RODY] Right. That bus'll get us to the border. And it'll be free if we hop on top. Absolutely not! We have to pay if we ride. We're wanted bad guys, remember? It'll be over if somebody recognizes us. Aw, man. [RODY] See? A freebie's not so bad. The delinquent life grows on you. You'll see, hero. [IZUKU] Delaware Smash. Air Force! I just paid for two seats. And yet I get the feeling we're staying on the roof. [IZUKU] Well, yeah. That's nonsense! What evidence is there to support that? Explain everything you have on Deku, Commissioner General. The case against Izuku Midoriya is still pending. I'm afraid I can't discuss any of the finer details with you. Especially considering you're his current boss and fellow countryman. [ENDEAVOR] Tch. [COMMISSIONER GENERAL] Endeavor. Japan's number-one hero. He's gravely afflicted with Stage Five. [COMMISSIONER GENERAL] For humanity's salvation. [CLAIR] Shoto! I just got this report back from a detective friend of mine. What does it say? [CLAIR] It appears the car you saw was attacked by a Quirk. The strange thing is, the driver was a member of Humarise. [gasps] Wait, Humarise? Well, did he survive the accident? [CLAIR] He's comatose, in critical condition. Police are standing watch outside his room in the ICU. So we can't interrogate him yet. And there's one other thing, too. It looks like the stolen jewelry was left scattered nearby the scene. Huh? But why? [phone chimes] It's a message from Midoriya. What does he say? [TODOROKI] "Keep eating lunch with strawberries and make sure you eat the dinner in the fridge, too." Why is he telling me what to eat? This is odd. This must be some kind of code. Clever. K-L-A-Y-D. What does this mean? Did he flee to the neighboring country of Klayd? If not yet, he must be heading there. Which means I'm going, too. All right, then. I'll update Endeavor. [TODOROKI] Bakugo, come with me. [KATSUKI] Get your hands off me! [KATSUKI] It's about Deku, huh? [TODOROKI] I'll explain later. First, let's lose the police. Don't order me around! [IZUKU] I hope Todoroki and the others figure out my code. What secret is hidden inside this case? [IZUKU] Looks deserted. No police around. Hey, uh... Do you mind if I run and make a call real quick? Oh. Sure. They didn't have anything about you on TV, so you should be okay to show your face. Try to make it short, though. Got it. [phone rings] [STANLEYK] Stanleyk here. Yo. Old man. [STANLEYK] Hm? Is that you, Rody? Yeah, sorry to call ya out of the blue, but can you swing by my house and tell my little brother and sister that I won't be home for a while? I'll pay you later. Promise. [STANLEYK] You idiot! I have no obligation to do you favors! And besides. I got a complaint saying the big delivery was never made! [RODY] Things went south. [STANLEYK] No excuses! [RODY] It's not my fault! [STANLEYK] If you don't want to die, then hurry up and deliver the goods! Got it? [beep] [RODY sighs] I don't have the goods. [RODY] Damn it! Hey, is everything okay? [RODY] Heh, oh, yeah, life couldn't be any better. [KATSUKI] Huh. So, you think that the cases got switched? [TODOROKI] Yes. The jewelry store was robbed by a villain. But Midoriya thinks that there was some kind of mix-up on the street. So the one he has now used to belong to a Humarise member. No jewelry. And that's probably the reason the police are chasing him. Moron. [TODOROKI] Possibly. I'm guessing, whatever he's carrying around is important. Question is, why are the police mobilizing on such a large scale? Humarise members have infiltrated the police force. [TODOROKI] Yeah. And there's no telling when they'll make their allegiances known. We have to be careful. [KATSUKI] I'll do what I want! [IZUKU] That's not great. Doesn't look like anything's crossing the border from here. We'll have to borrow a vehicle of some sort tomorrow. Otherwise, we'll be stuck walking. [RODY] Walking? You're crazy. Did you forget how heavy this thing is? If you get tired, I can just carry you on my back. After all, that's what strength is for, right? Helping people out whenever they're in trouble. Heh. Maybe fix our current situation rather than treating me like a backpack. Oh, I will. I promise. [CHILDREN laughing] Time for takeoff! [RODY immitating plane engine] Let me, Big Brother! Here you go. You're so lucky! Lift me up next! Then me! [EDDIE] Wow, Rody! [gasps] Dad! Welcome back! Hey there, kiddos. What's the deal? Why is the puzzle you brought home so hard? How am I supposed to solve this thing? I'll help, but I'm only giving you one hint. You should be able to figure it out from here if you keep trying. [gasps] [RODY] Dad. This is yours. [EDDIE] It's a present. [gasps] [EDDIE] Thanks for always taking care of Roro and Lala. You're a good brother, Rody. [NEIGHBOR AA] I heard the father abandoned them. [NEIGHBOR A] It's worse. He became a member of Humarise. [NEIGHBOR B] That group who thinks Quirks are a sickness? Ugh, they're whack jobs. [NEIGHBOR C] They were behind that incident the other day. [NEIGHBOR BB] Wasn't the dad a famous engineer, though? I never would have seen this coming. [NEIGHBOR D] Kids, I don't want you to play with them anymore. Who knows what they might have picked up from him? [BOYS] Okay. [BOY A] Let's go to the park! [BOY B] Yeah! ...[LALA] Big Brother ...[RORO] Brother [RODY] We'll be fine. I'll always stay with you, okay? You never have to worry about me leaving. [IZUKU] If this case is related to some sort of crime, we can't give it to the bad guys. We might accidentally be helping out real villains. [chirping] [phone ringing] [RODY] Hello? [PINO chirping] What's happening? [IZUKU] No. He wouldn't. [PINO chirping] [RODY] Are you with the police? [ROGONE] Hand over the package. So yeah. This means I'm free to bounce, right? [ROGONE] Where's your friend? [ROGONE] You both know, don't you? [yelps] [ROGONE] You must've figured out by now the reason we're after the briefcase. No, no I swear. We haven't got a clue! Please, my brother and sister need me back. They're only kids. You have to let me go home! [ROGONE roars] [RODY yelps] Air Force first. Then... Smash! I... I'm so sorry! [gasps] [IZUKU] Smash! Why did you do that? I need you to hold on to me tightly. [BEROS] Damn it! [IZUKU grunts] Wait here, okay? I'll find a doctor or somebody quick. [IZUKU] No. It's not that deep. I'll be fine, don't worry. It destroyed my phone, though. [IZUKU] You mind? I think there's a first aid kit floating around in my backpack. [RODY] Oh. Yeah. That archer is a tough one for sure. Once I'm patched up, we're gonna need to find another place to hide. Why did you take the arrow back there? Huh? What are you asking? [RODY inhales] [RODY] I betrayed you. You know that. I stole the case while you slept. Instead of worrying about me, you could have grabbed it and run away. Uh... Why would I do something like that? [RODY] I was carrying the jewelry the villains stole this afternoon. I'm one of those bad guys you heroes hate and wanna throw in jail! [IZUKU] Well, I can't ignore when someone's in trouble. It's kind of my life's dream to help people. But why would a criminal like me be worth getting hurt over? It's always worth it if I'm able to help someone, no matter who it is. I do not get you. [IZUKU] That's why I admire heroes. I want to be someone who can save people, with a smile on my face the whole time. I want to be like All Might. [RODY] You're talking about the blond one, yeah? He's pretty famous. [IZUKU] Uh-huh! He's my teacher. [RODY] Seriously? So you wanted to become just like All Might, and you chased that dream until it became a reality for you. Heh. You an' me couldn't be any more different. Huh? [RODY] My future's pretty set in stone already. I don't have the luxury of saying nonsense like "I wanna be a pilot." It's all I can do to provide for my younger siblings. ...Well, maybe... ...[RODY] Don't say a word. I don't want your pity! Stupid heroes. I've always thought they were people looking for attention, who wanted to make money under the guise of helping others. You see, pros never come to the place where I live. They wouldn't make any cash there. But... I guess there are heroes like you around, too. The more you help me and I get to know you, the more I wonder about what I'm doing with my own life. Truth is, I'm pretty lame. I would say the same about myself. I've wanted be a pro hero forever, since I was just a little kid. But I was too weak. People kept telling me my goals were impossible. I couldn't use my Quirk properly at first, and I was at the bottom of my class. Even now, I'm always being helped out by my classmates. I'm still weak. That's why I wanted so badly to improve. To become a hero who saves people. And always with a smile. [RODY] Oh. Yeah. That's Pino. Hi, Pino. [PINO chirps] Oh, and by the way. The name's Rody Soul. We sorta skipped intros. And my name's Izuku Midoriya, but call me my hero name, Deku. "Deku." That's easy to remember. Yeah. It's grown on me. [PINO chirps] [IZUKU] Let's get some sleep, Rody. [RODY] Yeah. Good idea, Deku. [COMMISSIONER GENERAL] I deeply apologize. They escaped before we could neutralize them. The entirety of the police force has been mobilized to seek out their location. [FLECT] Can't you get the army involved? I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid that's beyond my jurisdiction. Then continue with the search. Of course. For the salvation of humanity. [gravel crunching] [gasps] A villain? Rody? Sorry, did I wake ya? [IZUKU] Where'd you get a truck? I kinda borrowed it. Just figured we were done walking. Even wrote an IOU in the name of the World Hero Association. They'll understand. Wish they'd had a Cessna, we could've flown straight into Klayd that way, no problem. Like, an airplane? You can really fly something like that? [RODY] Only in my dreams, friend. Get in. [RODY] Question. [IZUKU] Yeah? [RODY] Once we figure out the case's secret, I can go home, right? [IZUKU] That should be fine. Oh. I bet your younger brother's waiting for you at home, huh? Yeah, with my sister. What about your parents? My mom died right after she had my sister, so it was up to my dad to take care of the kids. He did a pretty good job there for a while, raising us while juggling work, then he suddenly up and disappeared one day. [IZUKU] Disappeared? Do you know about that group called Humarise? I do. They're a terrorist organization. Yeah. After people in town found out that Dad left to become a member, things got bad for my family. Our friends started ignoring us, we were kicked out of our school and out of our house, and I couldn't find anyone who would hire me for honest work. I'm sorry, that's awful. I obviously resented my dad at first. But not so much anymore. I don't have time to think twice about him. Now, my little brother and sister are the most important things to me. I just want to create a decent future for those kiddos. [IZUKU] Aw! They're so cute. [RODY] My little brother's stupid smart! And my sister's totally adorable. First person to break her heart gets KO-d! [IZUKU] Whoa! Keep your eyes up, Rody! ♪ [RODY] Dang. I can't get over how useful your Quirk is. What about you? I mean, do you have a Quirk? I've been wondering. I don't wanna talk about it. Oh. Sorry. [RODY] You won't laugh, will you? I promise! [RODY] Really? No! I swear it! [RODY] Okay. It's kinda weird. [IZUKU] The path is heavily guarded. We're not gonna be able to go this route without fighting our way through. [IZUKU] Our only choice is to scale these ridges. [IZUKU] Get on my back. Hurry. [RODY] Deku. Take this. What's the deal? It'll be difficult for you to carry me with that injury from the arrow. This is where I say goodbye. Hold on. The truck's out of gas. I can't leave you alone in a place like this. [RODY] Come on. You know how fast I can run in a pinch. I'll scrounge up some food. Then I'll wait for you. You go figure out what's up with this case. That's what we're here for. But, Rody. [RODY] I'm counting on you, hero! [helicopter whirring] [IZUKU] It's them! [BEROS] I will not fail again! Use these. [RODY, IZUKU yelp] Ah, damn it. They're gonna flatten us! [IZUKU] Delaware Smash. Air Force kick! [screaming] Rody! Are you okay? [RODY] Yeah. Maybe. The case! Watch out! [RODY yelps] Rody! Deku, catch it! [IZUKU] I'm coming! For the salvation of humanity! [yells] Wait, is this Todoroki? You learned nothing from Hosu. Your codes are still hard to decipher. Oh, don't even try it. Wait. Free me, I'll do whatever you want. Tell me everything you know and maybe I'll consider it. Fine, yeah. You got it! [BEROS] Die, you traitor! [TODOROKI] Damn it. Bakugo, take her down. Don't give me orders! [PILOT A] We're out of control! Stand down and come quietly. [BEROS] For humanity's salvation. [POLICE OFFICER E] All units get over there! Rody, are you all right? Yeah, but I'm not sure how. [gasps] Where is it? [TODOROKI] Midoriya. I grabbed this. [IZUKU] Thanks, Todoroki. But how did you find us? All thanks to their flashy attacks. I spotted you from the train. Is he the one you were talking about on the phone? Yeah, that's right. He's been pegged as a criminal, like me. His name is Rody Soul. Hey, thanks for the assist. [KATSUKI] More importantly... The damn case. It's somehow connected to Humarise. What? Wait, are you certain about that? Yes. Our goal was to save both it and you. We thought it was possible we'd be able to get some useful intelligence. [gasps] What's the matter, Midoriya? [IZUKU] A compartment. [IZUKU] What is this? How does it work? Try pressing it right here? That'll just make it go back to how it was. [TODOROKI] Hm. This is hard. [IZUKU] Still not working. [KATSUKI] Ugh. Hand it over! I'll blow it up! [IZUKU] What? No. You can't do that, Kacchan. [RODY] Deku, can I see that for a second? You know how to solve it? [RODY] I did a puzzle like this before when I was a kid. [RODY] Let's see. Like this. And this. Aw, yeah. I think I got it. I'm not sure what this is. We need to figure out what's stored on this card. Okay, there's a town at the foot of the mountain. Let's investigate there. The target fled to the neighboring country of Klayd. I'm afraid I don't have the authority to search inside their borders, sir. [FLECT] No matter. If he has fled the country, then he won't be able to interfere with the plan while it's being carried out, will he? The time for revelation and the great reckoning has come! [HUMARISE MEMBERS] For humanity's salvation! For humanity's salvation! For humanity's salvation! For humanity's salvation! For the salvation of humanity! [HUMARISE MEMBERS gasp] Emergency alert, sir! Humarise has started a broadcast and it's streaming across the planet. Put it on the screen! [FLECT] Humarise will now fulfill its purpose. To protect the pure humans who are called "powerless," against those who have been infected by the wicked disease known as Quirks. We have developed humanity salvation devices that will cleanse this world. Soon, they will be activated in 25 countries. Seriously? [FLECT] This deliverance from evil shall be witnessed by all in two hours. That's hardly any time at all! [FLECT] However, we are not without mercy. If you wish to prevent this plan from going into effect, we will generously reveal the countries where our devices have been installed. What is he playing at? [FLECT] Even if you do not understand our righteous cause, you will have a chance to live on. [OPERATOR A] Director. These are the 25 zones the bombs are placed in. They match up with the locations of known Humarise branches! It's possible this is a giant trap. But we can't afford to be that cautious. [WHA DIRECTOR] Give marching orders to the hero teams on standby! [OPERATOR C] Yes, sir! [beeping] There's widespread panic in each of the 25 affected zones. [CROWD screaming] [OPERATOR C] Surrounding areas are in chaos as well. [OPERATOR AA] Streets are gridlocked. Transportation is a mess. Oh, no! Sun eater, you search for anybody who's injured. Red Riot and Real Steel, you secure a solid evacuation route! [GROUP] Roger that! Chimera Kraken! Let's do this! Come on, Red Gauntlet! There! This is your way out! Don't stand there gawking... go! Cementos! Make it a loud one, Mic. [inhales] Listen up, everybody! We've got a rockin' path for you over here, so get to sliding! [CEMENTOS] Remain calm. Don't panic! We're counting on you, search team! [GANG ORCA] Find me that Trigger Bomb immediately. Hear me? [HEROES] Understood, sir! [ASUI] Ribbit! [OCHACO] We've got the evacuations under control! Then it's up to us to find the enemy's device. [HADO, SIDEKICK AA] Right! Tsukuyomi, leave the evacuations to the American team. It'll be easier for us to find that death bomb with a bird's-eye view. Roger that! Go. Fierce Wings! [HAWKS] Leave no corner unsearched. Tokage! Take these sensors and spread them around the city. [TOKAGE] No sweat! We won't let anyone die today. [MAJESTIC] Momo, Shall we head to the next spot? Yes, sir! How are we supposed to find a tiny bomb hiding somewhere in this huge city? [SALAAM] Hello! Hello! Hello! [GROUP] Whoa, Salaam! You must find what you seek, not seek what you find! Follow me young ones! [KAMINARI, MINETA] He's so fast! [SERO] Guess being paper thin has its perks. [ENDEAVOR] Clair, where's the device, dammit? There's no sign of it in this area. Moving to the next location. [CROWD screaming] [ENDEAVOR] Shoto. What are you doing? Hurry up and get back here. [IZUKU] So many folders. Where do we even start? Move it! Where's the most recent time stamp? It's this video file. [ALAN] Hello. My name is Alan Kay. Along with several other scientists, I was kidnapped by Humarise. Kidnapped? [ALAN] In order to enact their plans, Humarise took our families hostage and forced us to manufacture Quirk Factor Triggering Bombs against our wills. The first terrorist attack using one of these devices was merely a ploy, to gather the world's top heroes in places where Humarise branches are located. The group is planning to use these horrible bombs to eradicate those pros. In an instant, the hero population will be decimated. After losing its top heroes, society would collapse. Using the vacuum of chaos afterward, Humarise will wipe out anyone with powers and build a world where only the Quirkless are allowed. That is the true goal of Flect Turn, the leader of Humarise. A madman. I hope my voice will reach the heroes in time. Eddie Soul, another scientist here, lost his life helping me. He made the key I've included that will disarm the bombs at their base. Please. Save the world. [screams] [NEWSCASTER B] I repeat, Humarise, the organization advocating for the salvation of humanity, has placed bombs around the world. The weapons are set to explode in one hour and 52 minutes, unless the heroes are able to find and disarm them, worldwide. As you might expect, panic has gripped the areas where the devices are said to be located. Heroes have been working to evacuate people to safety and subvert this attack. Areas in danger of being affected by the bombs are as follows. No, it can't be. That circle's in Otheon! My house is inside of it! [IZUKU] Oh, no. Where are you? [TODOROKI] We should send this to HQ and have them order the hero teams to retreat before it's too late. [KATSUKI] We can't do that. [IZUKU] The heroes are out there looking for the Trigger Bombs. Even if they're the actual targets of the terrorist attack. Even if they know this is a trap. As long as there are people who need help, the pros will never leave them and run away. That's what makes them heroes. Humarise counted on this when they came up with their plan. Then we use that disarming key. It's up to us to stop those bombs. But how do we do that? On it! The answer has to be in here somewhere. You're an idiot if you make a key without telling people where the lock is! We look for the place that wasn't part of their announcement. This is where their base is! Kacchan, Can you find where the bomb controls are? [KATSUKI] Let me work, ya damn nerd! [IZUKU] The furthest area underground. So we know where it is, but it's more than 400 kilometers away from where we are. [RODY] We can make it. I think I know how to get us there. [PINO chirping] [RODY] Don't worry. I know the basic controls. This is no time to be chirping! [TODOROKI] We'll definitely stop the Trigger Bombs. [KATSUKI] We'll crush those crazy cult bastards! [IZUKU] We'll protect the heroes, our friends, and the world! [beeping] [OPERATOR B] We just received a transmission from Shoto. He's a hero who was sent to Otheon. He says that he's obtained a master disarming key for the Trigger Bombs! Where is he now? [OPERATOR B] Heading to where the villain's main system is located, inside a hidden Humarise facility. [ALL MIGHT] Young Todoroki. Young Bakugo. Young Midoriya. Shoto's figured out a way to disarm these damn devices? Then let's go support him! We can't. Our priority is evacuation in case he should fail. [CLAIR] Endeavor! What is it? [CLAIR] I finally found the target. [ENDEAVOR] Where? [CLAIR] It's in front of the north gate of Otheon Tower. Inside a semi-truck! [ENDEAVOR] Heroes near the tower. Get that bomb out of here! [HEROES] Roger! ...[CLAIR gasps] ...Clair, come in! What the hell is this? [gasps] Shoji! They're saying Midoriya and the others are heading to disarm the bombs! [SHOJI] Don't lose focus! For now, we need to keep concentrating on the mission we were charged with. Right. Yeah. [GANG ORCA] There! I've found it. It's in the third container of that freight train! Quickly, shrimps! Go! We're on it. Oh, no! Villains! Crap. Of course there'd be guards. Uravity, Froppy, hurry! Get that bomb away from everyone! [OCHACO] Yes, ma'am! [OCHACO] I believe Deku and the others will stop the bombs for us! But we'll do what we can to back them up until then! Get outta the way! [yells] [OPERATOR A] Our teams have found the devices. But they're meeting resistance from Humarise. They're not making this easy. We have less than 30 minutes on the clock. [ALL MIGHT] The pros across the world are fighting desperately. But we're counting on you now, future heroes! [RODY] Almost there. [FLECT] The afflicted must be purged. [RODY] That's it! The base! Going in for a landing. Brace yourselves. [IZUKU] No. Rody, you turn back. [RODY] What? [KATSUKI] Extras like you should stay out of the way. [TODOROKI] He has a point. [TODOROKI, IZUKU, KATSUKI] This is a job for heroes! I don't have time for you idiots! [HUMARISE MEMBERS groan] [IZUKU] Some of their members have Quirks, too! I didn't expect there to be so many of them! [screams] [KATSUKI] A sound wave? [IZUKU grunts] ...[HUMARISE MEMBER M groans] ...[IZUKU] Kacchan! [KATSUKI] Yeah, yeah, I know! [HUMARISE MEMBERS groan] [HUMARISE MEMBERS scream] [TODOROKI] I've got you! Bakugo, we'll leave these guys to you! [HUMARISE MEMBER DD] Stop them! Don't tell me what to do! [HUMARISE MEMBER V] Take them down! It's a right at the end of this hallway. Hold on. [HUMARISE MEMBERS scream] [yells] [HUMARISE MEMBERS scream] [KATSUKI] Huh. Couldn't be easier. [KATSUKI] Why are you morons helping Humarise? You've got Quirks! Because we were personally chosen by Flect as the worthy. We will work alongside Humarise and live in their rebuilt world! Tch. Oh, I get it, you're just trying to save your own butts. Talk about selfish. As expected of villains. [KATSUKI] Die! [KATSUKI] They're fast! [KATSUKI groans] [laughs] I won't just stay behind. I have to help! [HUMARISE MEMBER W] You're Rody Soul, aren't you? [yells] [IZUKU] Todoroki! You go on ahead! Fast as you can. I'll stop you all at once. Flash freeze... Heatwave! [roars] [TODOROKI] My flames had no affect? [HUMARISE MEMBER X roars] [TODOROKI] He's raging out of control. Is he on Trigger? [HUMARISE MEMBER X roars] [TODOROKI] Somehow he's rotating his Quirk to control the flow of water. [IZUKU] Smash! [ENA laughing] [KATSUKI] The crap? How'd they cut through my explosion? [KATSUKI] You must not realize you're facing the best! [KATSUKI] Point blank range! [ENA yelps] [groans] [ENA laughs] [KATSUKI growls] [ENA] Too bad! All that jumping around's annoying! [KATSUKI groans] [BOTH laugh] [KATSUKI] Stop your laughing. It's getting on my nerves! [KATSUKI panting] [KATSUKI] Idiots never saw that coming, huh? I planted a few grenades while we were fighting. [KATSUKI gasps] [cackling] [KATSUKI panting] Hell, If you wanna get crazy, I'm right there with you. [IZUKU] Hurry! Faster! Get outta my way! [IZUKU] This is the deepest room in the base. [IZUKU] Which means the Trigger Bomb control system should be on the other side of those doors. [FLECT] How dare you? This is not a place where someone so diseased should set foot. [IZUKU] He must be their leader. Flect Turn. You have entered a holy stronghold that will bring about the salvation of humanity. [IZUKU] You think this is what the world needs? The Quirk Doomsday Theory hasn't been scientifically verified! You're basing your crimes on nothing but a rumor! How can you accept something so uncertain and use it to justify doing such terrible things? [FLECT] Pure humans are being threatened by the sickness of Quirks. Of that there is no doubt. As time passes these powers will mix, evolve, and run rampant, driving humanity to destruction. You don't know that for certain! Whether you have a Quirk or not doesn't matter. We're all alive. We're all human beings! The gravely afflicted are beyond our help. I suppose I shall have to force you to atone. [IZUKU] I'll stop your Trigger Bomb if it's the last thing I do! [IZUKU] Smash! [screams] [IZUKU] Did he counter my attack? No, this shock and force. It felt like I was hit with a Smash. [FLECT] That's right. I was born with this cursed plague myself. A disease that can't be cured. I automatically reflect all I come in contact with. [IZUKU] I knew it. His Quirk makes any attack against him bounce back. It's the kind of power that's always activated. So even though you have an ability of your own, you still think they're somehow evil? [IZUKU grunts] [IZUKU] Long-distance attacks don't work either. [FLECT] You would question me? Quirks are a tragedy. Because of this ailment, I was never once held by my parents, never knew a caring touch. Even my closest friends, and those I gave my heart to left me, their feelings repelled. I watched them all leave me, one by one. Since I reflect everything, I couldn't even choose death for myself. A Quirk that cannot be controlled leads to a life of suffering. But I can save others from this misery. These meta powers will trample no more hearts. [IZUKU] I won't use One For All until the moment of impact! [IZUKU] Even then... ...it didn't work! [IZUKU] The clock is ticking. I'll try to avoid him completely. [IZUKU] Right. Rely on speed, and get to the controls. I reject the corruption within my veins. [FLECT] I will eradicate this global contamination before it's too late. By doing so, I will save the worthy. The pure humans will rise to power once again. [screams] [FLECT] You wretched soul. [FLECT] In mere minutes, the baptism will begin. The blood of heroes will cleanse this broken world. And their deaths will bring about a glorious new reality. [IZUKU] I won't let you. Talk all you want. I will stop the Trigger Bombs! [FLECT] No. You will be sacrificed like your friends. [IZUKU screams] [IZUKU] Uraraka. Asui. [IZUKU] Kaminari. Sero. Mineta. [screams] [IZUKU] Kirishima. Shoji. Jiro. [groans] [IZUKU] Yaoyorozu. You're all fighting so desperately. [IZUKU] To stop these weapons from going off. To protect everyone's smiles. [IZUKU] Think. How can I beat this guy? [IZUKU] Rody. Why? It's fine now, Deku, don't you worry. [IZUKU] No. You have to run. [RODY] I will. Once I hand this over to the blue guy. [IZUKU] The disarming key? What? [RODY] Know that I am sorry. But they said they'd stop the Otheon explosion if I helped them out. Rody. Don't do this. If we work together, we can stop him and save everybody. Please! [RODY] How are you gonna stop anything when you're all messed up? We're out of time. The bombs are gonna explode. It's game over. [IZUKU] No. At least... I'm going to protect my family. I can do that much. [RODY] Look. I'm a worthless delinquent, Deku. I can't take on the world, much less save it. I'm not a hero like you. If I have to pick between society or my family surviving, the choice isn't that hard. It was the same for my dad. You forced his hand. That's true. Your father, Eddie Soul, helped develop the human salvation bomb. He knew that if he didn't, your lives would be forfeit. It was him. [ALAN] Eddie Soul, another scientist here, lost his life helping me. Please. Save the world. My dad didn't "help" you. You threatened to murder our whole family. He only worked for you because you made him. Fortunately, he had the clarity to make the correct decision. And it appears you're a wise man just like your father. You're protecting your loved ones. An honorable choice. I commend you. We're quite alike. I developed this plan because I love humanity and wish to save it. Rody, please. You can't do this. Rody! We can stop him. Sorry, hero, but this is how it all ends. That's life. People get betrayed. If it's any condolence, it happened to me, too. Nothing to cry about. [IZUKU] Rody. [IZUKU] What about you. I mean, do you have a Quirk? I've been wondering. [RODY] You won't laugh, will you? [IZUKU] I promise! [RODY] Really? [IZUKU] No! I swear it! [RODY] Okay. It's kinda weird. ...[FLECT gasps] ...[PINO chirps] [IZUKU yells] [RODY] Pino! [PINO chirps] Nice job. The plan's working, huh? ...Deku! ...[FLECT] You foolish boy! [IZUKU] Don't stop! [gasps] [IZUKU] No! [IZUKU] Rody! You impertinent child! [RODY] Deku! Don't you dare die. You kick his ass! [RODY] I'll stop the bombs! And you. You take 'im down, hero! Let's go! [IZUKU yells] I'm the end of the line. I don't care how strong you are. You won't get past me! [yells] [IZUKU] What about you? I mean, do you have a Quirk? I've been wondering. [RODY] You may think I'm joking, but... It's Pino. Ya see, her actions show my true intentions. Really? No matter how good I am at lying, Pino always gives away how I truly feel. [RODY] Almost. [RODY] Honestly, it's not much of a Quirk. [IZUKU] Oh, I wouldn't say that. Not being able to lie? I think that's pretty amazing. [grunts] [groans] [KATSUKI] Damn it! They're hammering my right side. [laughs] [KATSUKI groans] [ENA laughs] [KATSUKI] I think it's about time that you two shut it for good. [KATSUKI yells] [KATSUKI] No holding back. [KATSUKI] You're not getting up! Howitzer Impact! [panting] Happy now? You idiots. [TODOROKI] I'm... losing consciousness. [TODOROKI] Is that...? [TODOROKI] One last chance. [HUMARISE MEMBER X growls] [TODOROKI] I won't let you get in Midoriya's way! Flash freeze Heatwave! [TODOROKI grunts] [HUMARISE MEMBER X growls] [screams] [TODOROKI] You can manipulate flames, too? Fine. This is the most powerful move I've got! My Flash fire Fist. [TODOROKI] Jet Kindling! [yells] [HUMARISE MEMBER X groans] [TODOROKI] Midoriya. Make sure you stop them. [IZUKU grunts] [RODY] I'll be... like my dad. [RODY] And Deku. He would never give up. Rody? [FLECT] For both father and son to die in vain. There's no hope for such fetid scum. [IZUKU] Shut up. [IZUKU] Rody's not scum. He's my friend, and more noble than you could ever hope to be. [FLECT] What a pity. You still refuse to understand? Look at how brave he is! I believe in Rody! Because I believe in heroes! [ENDEAVOR growls] We need to lay down cover for Endeavor! Fight, Shoto. But whatever happens, I'll protect them. Push it faster, Fierce Wings! Get that weapon out of here. Hawks, Quick! We've just discovered a new Trigger Bomb. What? Well, is anyone on it? [CEMENTOS] This one should be taken care of. Any remaining devices? [SHOJI] We currently know of two. [JIRO] Wait! I've found a new one. So there's a total of three. [HUMARISE MEMBER AC groans] [KIRISHIMA] No way are the bad guys winning! Right, Bakugo? [IZUKU yells] [OCHACO] I'll get this in the air and send if far away... [ASUI] Ribbit! Ochaco! We lost control! [OCHACO] I won't give up! Because Deku would never give up! [IZUKU grunts] [KAMINARI] Midoriya and the others will fight to the end. [SERO, MINETA] So we won't stop! [IZUKU growls] [YAOYOROZU] It's my duty, as a hero. [IZUKU] That's right. Heroes always see things through! And we use our abilities for good! [growls] [FLECT] Hm? [IZUKU yells] [FLECT] What? Has he gotten stronger? [IZUKU grunts] Perhaps. But something else is different as well. [IZUKU] His resistance is decreasing! Yes! There must be a cap on what his reflecting Quirk can take! Good. [IZUKU grunts] [IZUKU] Simple, then. I'll surpass that limit! [yells] [FLECT] No, this can't be happening. Have I reached my boundaries? I didn't know such a thing was even possible! [IZUKU] Because you gave up. [IZUKU] If you didn't lose hope... If you kept trying... You might have been able to get along with people. But instead, you decided that powers are disease. And chose to wallow in self-pity. You're a failure because you stopped trying! Be silent. [IZUKU] A hero knows what it means to keep fighting until the end. Shut your mouth. That's why we always remind ourselves what we have to do. [FLECT] You filth. Go beyond! Plus Ultra! Shut up! [IZUKU grunts] Detroit Smash! [grunts] [yells] [IZUKU grunts] [ALL MIGHT] A real hero will always find a way for justice to be served! [IZUKU] I know, All Might. [ALL MIGHT] Young Midoriya! A hero has so much to protect in this world. Which is why... Which is why... ...I will defeat you! [bellows] [IZUKU] United States of World Smash! [FLECT] You're... too late. [KAMUI WOODS] The countdown is over. But... [OCHACO] There's no explosion. [ENDEAVOR] The bomb's not detonating. Did they disarm the bombs? [HAWKS] Yeah. That's a relief. [OPERATORS cheer] [ALL MIGHT] Well done. I'm so proud. [IZUKU] Thank you, Rody. You hang in there, okay? I'll get you to a hospital soon. [RODY] Deku. I did it, right? I protected my family? Just like my dad did. [RODY] And I stopped the bombs? [IZUKU] Yeah. I didn't give up. I saw it through just like you would. You did great. You're amazing, Rody. That's true. I am pretty cool. [BOTH laugh] [BOTH laugh] [REPORTER AA] The terrorist attacks that shook the world were successfully prevented through the efforts of multiple hero teams working in tandem. The members of Humarise, the group behind the threat, are being taken into custody. Some from unexpected places. [IZUKU] The case was resolved without a single new Trigger Bomb exploding. In the end, the heroes protected this world. But, it wasn't just the pros and students. The one who really saved everybody... The one who gave his all, was him. [PINO chirps] [IZUKU] Rody! ...[PINO chirps] ...Ha, ha! Didn't think you'd be out so soon! Heh. Ah, they said I was good to head back home. Well, I'm glad to hear it. [RODY] Although, if I had died stopping those bombs, I would've become a total legend. [IZUKU] That's a morbid thing to say! ...Hah! ...[RODY, IZUKU laugh] So, hey. Come up with any big plans for the future? Just going back to my normal life for now. Though, I suppose, with all I've been through, who knows what's in store for me? [chirps] Right. [AIRPORT ANNOUNCER AA] We will now begin boarding for flight NNY224. [IZUKU] I gotta run and catch my flight. [RODY] Do me a solid and stick to Japan, 'kay? Nothing good happens when you're around. Probably best for everyone if you stay in your lane. I'll come back and visit for sure. Yeah, like I care. [RODY] Got a job for me, old man? Like a real gig. Somethin' that's more respectable. One of my employees did quit on me. Guess you can help. That is one possibility. [PINO chirps]
