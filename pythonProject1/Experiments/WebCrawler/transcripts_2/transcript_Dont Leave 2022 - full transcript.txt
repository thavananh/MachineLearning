[machine] The person you have dialed cannot be reached at the moment. Please... - Fucking phone! - [glass shattering] [glass breaking] [door opening] Fuck me. ["Future Days - Hey! Douglas remix" by Islandman playing] - Wow. - Well, well, well, well. Thought you'd been banned from coming back. - Don't know, bit foggy. Thank you. - That's how I remember. - How much have you had to drink? - Go on, Beril. Just came to say hey. So how are you? All good. You? I'm waiting up for Nazim. I left my jacket. - Oh, is he around? - As if he ever leaves. Shh. I'm gonna donate this if you leave it ag... - Whoa, Seksek! - [Beril laughs] - Nazim, yo... - What's up, dude? - Good. How about you? - Doing great. Welcome, welcome. - Thanks. - Want a drink, babe? - I'm good, babe. Thanks. Another time. - For real? Hey, come on. Don't leave if you don't want to. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Dude, we're always here. The question is if you can stay. - Where have you been, Semih? - I'm here now. A pinch too late. A bit. [laughs] I have a shop now. It's just one alley up. Come by sometime. - Oh! I will. - You've got to visit. If it won't cause issues. Don't want any trouble. - I'm leaving. Gotta jet. Bye. - Where you going? - [Beril] I'm gone. - How long's it been, three years? - What? - I said, has it been three years? I wasn't counting, dude. You named this place, but you never came once it opened. I came now, I'm here. Cheers. [glasses clanking] Hey, what do you think? - [Semih] Mmm. - So good. I'm gonna put it everywhere. Where's Defne? Oh no. You can't let them do that. [rock music playing] [laughing] Yeah. That's what I thought. [laughing] So you told a joke. That is like... [Semih] Ahem. Whoa! - What the hell was that? What was that? - Shit! [Semih laughing] I'm fucking soaking wet. What was that? Do you kiss every woman who looks your way? Oh! No, of course not. But when they smile with feeling... Or maybe they're just polite. Maybe you should introduce yourselves? This is Semih. - Why would you think I'd want that? - Yeah. Let's get acquainted. You are? - Why do you ask? - I'll use it in a sentence. Do you mind? - Are you always like this? - [giggles] Like what? A little... little weird? The weird ones will bring the end of the world. You don't understand that poem... Understand? What? - Which high school? - [Nazim] The German School. Oh! Entschuldigung. We're all out of studying for the day, I'm afraid. - We have whiskey. - Yeah? - And we have wine. - What else? Your name? What's the rush? What is with you? - Hey. Look at me, I'm all wet. - You deserve far worse. - Defne, come on! - Come on, Def! Semih's like a brother to me and you know what? He actually is a great guy. Yeah. It's just... Today, he's just a bit weird. - You're an idiot, Nazim. Out of my way. - Where are you going? Hey, hey! - Hey. We'll all be at the studio Sunday. - What? What are you talking about? Defne'll be there too. It's a nice studio. [serene music playing] [TV] There are footprints in front of me. Which means that someone has passed through here before. [upbeat music playing] [man] And keep it up. Well, well, well, it's Semih. We got you in. Oh, I'm just here to hang. All right, cool. Got a cycling class now, but, um, it's just an hour. - We should cook up a program for you. Hey. - Sure, sure. Hey, thanks. Hey, so, Ares, didn't you have a session with Defne? She canceled, bro. Oh. Ah, yeah, that's great. [banging noise] [door unlocks, creaks] [sighing] - [door bell rings] - [opens bottle] [cork hitting floor] [man] Semih, I know it's late. Hope I'm not disturbing you, son. No problem. I already called Defne. You know, your lease renews next month... She told me that you broke up, and I should talk to you... about the rent increase. So, I thought I'd drop by to, you know, talk to you... I can come another time, okay, son? She said that? [depressing music playing] [lighter clicking] [lighter clicking] [sighing] Oh! What a surprise seeing you here. Huh? - [woman] Exactly. - What's goin' on? - This is unacceptable. - She's on edge. I'm sure it's some shit about Ugur. [whispering] She's coming. [woman] ...any longer than it's already taken. Honey, how are you feeling? Yezdan told me that you were sick. No, I'm just fine, thank you, ma'am. - You better be, I need you. [giggles] - Sure. What is it she need you for? Maybe you should ask, Semih. Huh? Quit the drama. Man, you don't know. She's been vicious. Then she's laid back with you. I feel for her. The clients lost their minds. They don't know what they want. The way you do things is better, I guess. Maybe I should care less. [whining] God, when'll I be able to do the things I really want? Like, I wanna play guitar, but that's not working out. I wanna go to concerts more, and I can't. Nothing gives me joy. - [phone dings] - And I feel I'm at the end of my rope. I guess I'm aging. Hopefully, I'll be dead soon. Or maybe my husband will die. Or maybe we could have a baby, just so something would be different... - Come on, you fucking phone. - You're taking forever with it. What is this phone you got? - It's broken. Is it Defne? - Def... She said she's taking her things. Did you guys break up? - Nah. Give me that. - Huh? Taking her things? You were taking forever to read it, so I helped you, man. I don't know what's going on. Maybe it's retrograde. It's like everyone I've talked to lately is feeling like they don't have motivation to go on, you know? - Are you upset or something? - [phone ringing] Hello? [woman] Hi, it's Hande from Sevcen Real Estate. Who is it? Well, you called me and left a message. You said you needed my help, because you need to move. I didn't want to disturb you on the weekend, so I waited. No, I didn't call you about anything. [Semih, drunken] Hello. Damn, just help me out so that I can find a good place. Let's sort this out. Then we can cry. [laughs] All right, I gotta go. Good night, don't let the bed bugs bite. [woman] I have a client. - [man] I cut the corner. - [woman] Come back later. Go. - [sighs] Dear, oh, dear. - Ahh... You were right. I gave you a call. I used Nazim's phone, though, 'cause my screen is shattered, so... I'll tell you something. Alcohol and phones don't pair well. I'll have some drinks and start ranting all over Twitter, and when I get up, I'm like, "Who could post that, though?" By the way. You didn't have to come down here just to tell me you're not looking for a place. Nevzat! Two cups of tea! What? I mean, it's not like you'd come here if you weren't looking for an apartment. We never strong-arm our clients. You called me, and I'm offering my help. See what this says? Kindness is our brand. Your choices are your own. [laughing] So, what's it gonna be? We looking for a place? [Defne] I feel bad for those people. No one buys from them. [serene music playing] [man] What'd you do to that guy, man? - I bought out his business, bro. - [man] Yo! For you. - I'll take that. Get your sweets here! - Come on. [jazz music playing] - Wow! Really? - [audience member catcalling] As if. [crowd laughing] - Yeah, no. [laughing] - [Semih laughing] Congrats, I heard you got a new job. Yeah, well, we'll see if it's a good thing or not. You feel hesitant about it? No, it's not hesitance, but... Well, my mom pushed me into it. - Got it. - Yeah. So you really had no... no choice. [laughing] I could've said no, I didn't have to say yes. So? - I don't wanna be a burden to her. - Gotcha. - So what's your actual thing? - You're asking? ♪ Handed it out through the window Told me to blow ♪ - [piano playing] - [Defne laughing] ♪ He looked stubborn I told him to piss off ♪ ♪ You do not know who I am ♪ [piano playing] Okay. ♪ I winked and blinked Trying to say it's okay ♪ ♪ A hundred lira bill inside the registration ♪ Whoo!

Thank you. - Tell you what... - Hm. Well... You be the breadwinner, and I'll do the fun stuff. How's that? But then you'll be my burden, won't you? [razzing] Yeah, right. As if. [singing rock song] [Defne] Did you love her? [Semih] Yeah. It felt different. - [Defne] Different? That's nice. - [Semih laughing] [Semih] Not that different, but still... [Defne] Were you the one who ended things? Oh, you know. It's like we were on overtime. Or something. You know how it is. - Overtime's the worst kind of time. - [both laughing] You just stop playing? That what you mean? - For sure I do. Immediately. - Damn, it's really hot. [both laughing] - Fine. [sniffs] Okay. - Mmm. Might there be any competition these days that I should know about? No. And I don't want any anyway. You should fall in love sometime. It's a great feeling. I mean that. Yeah... If we fell for every guy who got cotton candy... Ah! A LITTLE WEIRD It'd be a little weird, don't you think? [sighing] [door creaking] [keys rattling] [somber music playing] What the hell? Psst! Seksek? Semih! [bottles clanking] - You all right? What's going on? - Nothing, bro. - [groaning] - Woah! What'd you do? Dude, ow, my hand got stuck. I should've broken up with her. We were on borrowed time. I couldn't see it. This shit. We should go to the ER. I can whip you with one hand, don't worry. That's how you pass the ball, dude! You don't know shit about this game, dude. Didn't mean to upset you, man! Your love life is better when you don't just score your own goals. - [laughing] - [whistle sounding] [cheering] [sighing] You know, she took everything. I don't know when she decided, it was quick. The whole situation reeks of thinking ahead. What it looks like to me. Yeah, right? Absolutely, man. Exactly, why else would she have acted so quickly, out of the blue? [sighing] Have you guys talked? Nope. Why not? You guys haven't called each other? Why'd we do that, dude? It's finished. [car passing by] I just wonder why she did it. I didn't cheat on her or something, and I didn't treat her badly. I'll be real, Seksek. My mom visits twice a week, the cleaning lady twice, and a prostitute twice, too. And I get one day alone. [giggles] Anything more than that would be too much. It would be for me, dude. Same goes for you too, you know. Was out of nowhere. She took me by surprise, dude. It'll all shake out. It will. But still. Still what? Don't expect it to be easy. The "getting over" of it. Don't you see that she's over me? She's doing what she wants. She's past it just like that. What's holding me back? [doorbell rings] I'm not sitting around. I've got a whole life to live. [Nazim] Easy. - I guess we'll see who's over who. - [door creaks] Hey. Hello. I ordered dessert, I thought it was them. That's why I'm surprised. Get in here. [traffic noise] [Semih clears throat] - Well? - The concert was great. - [both laughing] - Yeah, it was amazing. It was great. You see that Nazim nodded off? That idiot. He's more interested in women than music. [laughing] Yes, though, Mister Semih, you were sweet. Ah, thank you. I'm but a reflection. [giggling] I was hoping you'd kiss me again. Huh? You really want me to... So why didn't you kiss me? Tell me that. Oh, sorry, that's right. You have no intention of us being a thing. Right? I want to be happy, that's all. Is that good for you? Let's find out. - [car horn honks] - Yeah, let's. [Semih moaning] What? - You have wine? Red or white works. - Coming right up. One sec. Whatever you have. [slow rhythmical music playing] I hope you remember me as we first met. You could say it's the reason that I'm here. What's on your mind? Nothing. Impossible. The longest anyone's not thought is three seconds. - [Defne laughing] - [Semih laughing, coughing] - And how did they measure that? - Hmm. - I guess they had a timer or something. - [both laughing] [Semih] Mmm. [giggles] Okay. Ah. They always say to take it slow, but... We're on day two now, so I think we're all good. - Seksek? - [music stops abruptly] You know what you should do, dude? They say, "Before you make a move, think." They got the order wrong, dog. Serious. Make a move first, and then start thinking. Oh, hey. One more thing. Like hell you're over her. I'm not oblivious to this stuff.

Hey man, I have a friend who's your doppelgänger. Would you believe that shit? Is he really just a friend? Well, back in the day, that's how he wanted things to work. We went by that rule. How about now, are things different? - [laughing] I'm not your rebound. - I'm here to get coffee, nothing more. Cool. Great. There's a patio in the back, you can go sit down there. Wow. So this is you living your dreams and paying your debt? Kinda. Not really sure which way this'll go. We're struggling. Turns out you can't achieve anything without struggling. The hell is "Akrasia"? A tree or something? Oh. [giggling] It does sound like that, though, right? It's when willpower is weak. Now I'm nervous. [chuckles] - [serene music playing] - [Semih] First impressions matter. Ready, ready, ready. Let's see, let's see, let's see. Semih. [semi laughing] - Oh! When did you even... - [cheering] How? How... how did you do this? Asli? [laughing] This is incredible. What's going on? Would you like to move in with me? I mean, it's closer to your work. - [friends cheering, applauding] - Hmm? You think moving will get you over it? There's nothing to get over. [cheering] If you guys make up, what'll you do then? She'll find the apartment deserted. It was six years. There's going to be some kind of damage report. - You really have become a shopkeeper, huh? - [laughing] By the way, you look like a real train wreck with all those bandages and stuff. Except for the hair, dude. The hair is fab. I can not get over it. Listen, why don't you spend your time on new things, like hockey. Horse racing. You should think about horse racing. - [crows cawing] - [birds chirping] [indistinct chatter] - Oh, hey, man. - Hi. What time's the meeting, bae? Whoa! What's with you? I wanna see what you guys get up to. Dude. What did you do to your hair? [laughing] We're all drawn to new things. So, what do we do? We don't go backwards, we go directly to new things, and there's not a single thing that can keep us back. Mm-hmm. Beautiful. [woman] Oh, thank you. [boss] Where'd you get it? [woman] Ceyda, I've had it forever, I don't remember. [Ceyda] I like it. So, what you're saying is that we should talk to this guy, and tell him that he's incompetent and doesn't know shit. Is that right? [woman] Not in those words, but we could express it. Right, we have to say it, and from the get-go, I've been asking you how we can tell him... Let me take a peek at that. You got injured again? You're always getting hurt. - Ma'am, just a little accident. - So, something like that. Hmm? You think I'm keeping you around for your looks, Semih? - Sorry, I don't follow. - Could you work this up, maybe? - Yeah... - This is it, see? It should be something like this. With story, flavor. A different kind of... This is a private notebook. I don't mean to pry. So, it should have a color, a spirit, something distinctive. Dude, even if I can make it, I can't stay. Uh-huh. Yeah, of course, man. You said it yourself. You bet. Catch you later, dude. We'll talk later. Buh-bye. "Of course"? "Of course Defne isn't coming." Is that what you mean? Of course. Am I wrong? The guy's been inviting us forever. - So it... - So it's what. Better putting blame on me? Oh, come on. Did you hear me say that? - I don't wanna go either. - Why don't you tell him that? - What? - "Bro, I don't wanna see you" works. [Semih laughing] - I'm gonna tell you something. - Let's have it. This is you. I just know it. I see it. - Oh. [laughing] - Yeah. So what should we do? Have some "alone time" in there? We're late. You like what you see? We found it? Now. Get this off. All right. So that's one. In fact... Get rid of these... And put these on. [grunts] See? Huh? We got it. We did it. Huh? Semih. ♪ Tell me something... ♪ So these are them? That you're throwing away? Not throwing them away. I picked them out so we could look at them together. Then let's look at them. Semih? [rhythmical music playing] Let's go. Get down here. See, a whole new me. Check it out! - Is that right? All right. - We're gonna be late. Get a move on! - You said come down there? - You are very naughty. Looking like this? Kinky. How is it? [grunting] - [agitated breathing] - I'm ready too. [door slamming shut] Sorry for throwing your clothes away without asking. [laughs] We made a scene in front of the whole neighborhood for a quickie. Look at us. - You had every right to do that. - That right? [romantic music playing] [music fading out] How'd you think it went? It was... average. And boring. What, like me? When did you hear me say that, huh? What is that? I mean, it was... [bus door opening] - Oh hey! - You were... - Come on! - What are you doing? Sir, could you please hold the bus? Baby, come on! - What are you doing? What is this? - Come, trust me. Let's go! - We're coming, sir. It's fine! - Semih! What's going on? We don't know where this bus goes. Yeah, and? Aren't you curious where it ends? Well? [giggling] All right... - Er... - Hmm. [dog barking] Defne? What's wrong? I really love you. [dogs barking] [sighing] [exhaling] Okay, I'm here. I'm all ears. [inhaling] I've always... [sighing] been unhappy, you know. - I suspected. - No. [huffing] You haven't seen that part of me. The dark in me. No one'd get it, even if you explain. [inhaling, exhaling] What happened to that side? [serene music playing] It's gone. Um... Being with you, I lost it. - Silly. - [sighing] [music fading] All right. Let's keep at it, shall we? Dismissed. - Ceyda! Ceyda! - [Ceyda] Okay. And nothing's missing? - I can improve on this. - Improve? You asked if I could improve this, yeah? You should improve it. That's what we expect of you. I mean, been the case. Right, Semih? - [car driving away] - [music playing inside house] - Think she wanted to get married. - Did she say that? - Huh? Who? - Defne. She said you two spoke. That isn't what she said, but that's usually how it is. They wanna get married, it doesn't happen, they break up. - Isn't that what happened? - No, we didn't talk about it. Not once. You may think that. But it probably came up. Hold up. What exactly did Defne tell you? You guys were obviously unhappy. She said "obviously"? She did say that. But it was, uh... obviously... you know, it was obvious. Yeah, for sure, right. That's right. Listen. You're not brooding over this, right? - No, I'm not. I'm... I'm not a kid. - Yeah. Let it out, son. - You should give yourself some time. - Yeah, I know. I'm just so busy lately. Hmm. - I'm moving into a new place soon. Yeah. - Hmm. Hey, that's great. - So you're totally over the thing. - A hundred percent. Good to hear. That's what Defne said to me as well, but I wasn't sure what was going on with you. Whether you were ready to start going out to parties. Should've told me. Defne's been going to parties? I kinda got that sense. She was supposed to come, but she realized you were coming, and she went and bailed on us. Let me give you a hug. Oh, darling. You didn't tell me about Defne and you. How are you? Yeah, I'm good, I'm good. - Doing all right. - Perfect. I landed a client, finally. - Phew, finally. - Congratulations. They mean business. They ask about deadlines. [Semih] Great. - Earth to Semih. You heard me, right? - Sure. Cool. Darling, you're gonna see how he hits the bullseye after all. We've been waiting a while, I'll add! [laughs] Taking your time? Huh, Semih? True. He just needed some time to get used to his position. - We didn't know it was gonna take so long. - Enough talk about business, stop it. Come. I don't want to hear about hair appointments, headaches, reasons for not coming into the office. This client matters to me. - Don't worry. - Tell me if you can't do it. I got this, don't worry. Okay. Ah, my love. Tansu's about to leave. Come on. - [man] Tansu. Coming, coming. - Go on, it's fine. And thank you. [pop music playing] [panting] [breathing, moaning] Hold on a second. Quit. Someone will find out. [knocking on door] [rhythmical music playing] [plonking on strings] [sighing] [groans] You were doing great! - How long were you there? - What, at your recital? I give up, I can't play this thing. - I tried 'cuz you gave it to me. - Well. Your trying is beautiful. Should've taken off your shoes. [inhaling deeply] [kissing sound] I've been on YouTube for hours, now I've got a headache. I think it's great. You should quit your job and do music, babe. And you should play your ukulele, which we paid for. I don't know, it's a bit small. Let's get a bigger one! Wow, you really hate trying. It's 'cause I hated my music teacher in elementary. [metal clanking on glass] [Defne] Don't drink from the bottle! And fill it back up after, will you? Did you forget my clothes? [grunting] I'm really sorry. It slipped my fucking mind. Semih, I asked you to do one thing. One thing! I know, I know. You said the meeting was important. I know. - There! There you go. - What the hell? Shit. Semih? [sighing] No, wait. Uh, hold on, we'll figure something out. - His number's gotta be here. - Figure out what? I'll figure it out, beautiful, just hold on. Uh... - I got it. - I'm gonna head home, Semih. - Wait. Don't go. Hang on. - I'm heading home. [sad music playing] LEVENT DRY CLEANING FOR SALE - HANDE SEVCEN SEVCEN REAL ESTATE AGENCY [lighter clicking] [music turning suspenseful] [music ending abruptly] [pop music playing] [Hande] I'm still waiting for you to come and clean that window. If only you would respond to my texts. Mind you, I did call you back. It just kept on ringing. That isn't possible, Miss. [giggling] Now this is something. I'm almost doubting myself. Look at your face. Well, if you say so... I do! I called two times. I started thinking it was a coincidence, but then I told myself, "Slow down. You're gonna make this guy move, and he doesn't even want to." I do that. [laughing] And you're not even in the market for a place, are you, huh? No, I am. As soon as possible. It's quite urgent. Then go on the internet, and search for yourself. Uh... Would saying I'm sorry make it up? I won't keep chasing you. I'll tell you that much. Really, don't you think this is getting weird? - Like I'm coercing you or something? - No, it's not anything like that. Whatever. And you know what I think? I don't think you're looking for a place. You told me that on the first day. Am I right? Well, you enjoy the pool. - Nice ass. - [rave music playing] It is a nice one. I'll admit to that. - Want me to hook you guys up? - But you don't have the guts. Mmm. Come here. Hey. [whispering loudly] Pa... Def! [laughing] Excuse me. My boyfriend has a thing for tattoos. - Huh? - [laughing] He stopped in his tracks when he saw your tat. Is it okay if he has a closer look? Def? Hey. Your jealousy is getting out of hand. And who's to say what's out of hand and what's not? - This is getting really old. [scoffs] - What's getting old? What is it, Semih? Just stop getting jealous, okay? Maybe you don't like being in a relationship, Semih! - Def. - Maybe I'm boring. No, you're not. I'm just a little weird. - Def! Def! - Fine. [birds chirping] [Semih] Isn't it great we came out here, huh? - Hey, I told you about this before. - Who told you I wanted a kid? - Yeah, but we were slowly going that way. - No, we weren't. My friend just gave birth. Can I not talk about that? And if I did want one, why would I do it with you? You're right about that. You have to have sex to make a kid. So... I have a job, dammit! I'm not messing around like you always are. [Semih sighing] You always need action, something going on. You can't be still. Like you have a bug up your ass. Start rowing. No, no. Let's float here a while. Nah, why don't I see what it's like to be still. [groans] [sighing] [smacks tongue] - [water splashing, boat banging] - What are you doing? No! Come on, then! - Whoo! Let's go! Whoo! - Whoo! - [serene music playing] - [Defne hollering, laughing] [both breathing quickly] - [sound of water running intensifying] - [music stops abruptly] [Semih inhaling] Yes, I know that it's not done yet. That it has a long way to go. [Ceyda] Mmm. [smacks tongue] Yeah. This is not us. You said you'd tell me if you couldn't do it. - I'm working to try and fix it. - Even working's not enough sometimes. - Keep at it, but don't base it on this. - Yes, ma'am. [indistinct chatter] - I want to ask something, Ceyda. - Quick, please. Would it be possible to receive advance payment? Advance? We dispensed your salary. I know, but I'm having some trouble with my rent. I just... I'm planning to mo... Hello. İsmail, Semih's coming to you. Give him an advance for the new contract. [hangs up phone] - I think you were about to say thank you. - I really appreciate it, thank you. Mm-hmm. Make good on this, or I deduct it from your salary. - Yeah, for sure, I've got it. - Yes, you do. I got it. Oh, Lord. [indistinct chatter] [phone ringing] I said, "You expect us to work, but you never sent us the details," letting him have it. Then he says, "Ceyda, I sent the e-mail." Özge, what is wrong with you? What were you thinking? - [phone buzzing] - [woman] How could she miss that? - [Özge] I honestly never received it. - [Ceyda] I don't need your excuses. I told the man that we didn't have it, and I took quite a lot of... Yes, baby? - [Ceyda yelling] - Why do you sound like that? What's wrong? Oh no. [Ceyda] ...the hours I pay you... Oh damn. Oh, my poor baby. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know. How could I forget? I can't even imagine. [smacks tongue] Don't cry. [Ceyda] There's a lot riding... Sorry for your loss. For sure. Uh-huh. [softly] I know, my beautiful darling, I know. - Say something. - I'm truly sorry. Oh, you're... All right. - And now it's all better. - All right, listen. Hey, stop, stop crying. Listen to me. Listen, Ceyda squeezed in another meeting. I need to go back in there right now. [chair slamming] I'll get over there... I'll get over there as soon as I'm out. All right. Okay, love you. Bye-bye. [Özge] What meeting? [exhales] The meeting, you know, we've got a meeting. [meekly] Yeah, like you attend those. Def's grandmother passed away. - My condolences. - Yeah. I'm not good with these kinds of things. What kind of things? Things, you know. Funerals and so on. Crying people and all that sort of stuff, you know. - That is not for me. It's not my thing. - It's a part of our lives. [Semih sighing] What's up with you? Honestly, the same. Wanna just get the fuck out of here. Ceyda's absolutely crushed me. She's never happy with me. Shh-shh-shh. Hey, hey, what happened? You'll sort this out, no big deal. She took it too far this time, Semih. Like I was a kid. She screamed at me. I know, but that's just Ceyda being Ceyda, isn't it? Forget her, what'd Ugur say to you? He likes what I do, but at the end of the day, he's Ceyda's husband. What he thinks matters. She's just same old Ceyda. It takes it out of me. Of course it takes it out of you. - This is work. - [sniffles] Get some coffee and pull yourself together. You hear me? - You're something, you know? - Mm-hmm. You're supposed to be at a funeral, and you're consoling me. Wipe your tears. Let's go. Work. Allez, allez. [exhales] - [groaning] - [door closing] [phone ringing] - [sniffles] - [indistinct chatter] [traffic passing by] [elevator dings] [sniffles] - Does your offer for help still stand? - [elevator dings] Hmm? Pizza and wine tonight. On me. Hmm? [prolonged] Please. She's gonna burn me to a crisp! - [laughing] - Come on, come on. Come on! - All right, I'll call my folks at home. - You're the best. - [phone ringing] - Keep the cotton balls, have to take this. Hello. I'm on my way there, Mom. No need to panic. I told you, he's there, waiting for you. Why couldn't you get him on time? What if something happens to him? He's grown. What do you expect will happen? And why didn't you tell me earlier? How could I know when he'd land? - I sent you a text. - I told you my phone's screen is broken. Then go get it repaired. Hüseyin called. He said something about eviction. Are you moving out or what? Damn, why in the hell is that man calling you? Because your phone's broken, son. Can we talk later? I'll call you another time. Bye, Mom. Okay. Got it. [presses button] - [alert dings] - Hi. Hello. [indistinct chatter] You did not. This cannot be happening. Oh, Def! [laughs] This is a surprise. [laughs] Excuse me. The two of us know each other. - If you'd switch... - Don't switch, I'm good. Don't bother. I'm good. - I don't want him... - She's pretending she doesn't know me. - She doesn't want... - Problems? No problem. She's been bugging me since I came aboard. Don't know what you're supposed to do. She's asking me to sit with her. And I'm an aisle person. [Defne sighs] [indistinct chatter] Kars seems like an interesting place to visit. [sighing] I'm sick and tired of your eccentrics, all right? - You don't care for me. - I'm here because I care for you. No meetings for once? Shocking. [scoffs] I know what I did, but Ceyda stressed me out. You get me? I know it's stupid, but I couldn't get out of the office. I couldn't make it to the funeral. I'm sorry about what happened. - I wish I would've been there. - I wish you wouldn't be here. But you hate these conferences, Def. You know I know that. I can handle it. Without you. Oh, without me? Without me? Just watch me. Watch this. I'll crash this plane. Where's that red lever? I'm gonna bring this plane hurtling to the ground! All our lives just go away. You hear me? I'm joking. I'm just joking. We had something we needed to work out here. I'm sorry. We're almost there. See you in Kars. [smacks tongue] Listen to me. You are not allowed to bother me today, okay? Hear me? I don't want you near me, I don't want constant calls. And really, just don't do anything stupid. No planning your schemes. Okay? - Hear me, Semih? - Shhh! I can't focus on my reading? Don't worry about me. - Psst! - Huh? Is the minibar paid for? - Hello, welcome. - Hi, thanks. [soft jazz playing] - [indistinct chatter] - [smacking tongue] Whisky, please. Single. Thank you. You bet. Give me another. [sighing] Nice tattoo. Did it myself. Wow. Thank you. [giggles] - What is it you're doing here? - [laughing] My job. Oh yeah? [flirty] And what is it that? My girl, I'm with her. She's at the conference. And so you're here to, like, do what? Raise her morale? - [laughing] Or what? - Give me a napkin, could you? I'm a fan of Kars. Really? And what do you like most about Kars? Er... It's cold, but pretty. Beautiful. And you? Why aren't you in there? Mmm. It's just a formality for me. - My dad was nagging me about it. - Is he the company president? Kinda. Yeah. Well, my family has a "corporate" history. - Okay - Expecting me to be their next in line. - [both laughing] - What? And you're not? Of course, hope stays alive until you die, but I don't get any joy from a conference. [car horn honking] What kinda place you have in mind? A place I could own. Which is to say, some place that I can afford. [laughs] Good coffee, snack selection, and some afternoon cocktails. That's it. Cool. We'd come. You better. Don't you ever get tired of yourself? [Semih exhales] Don't know. [giggles] There's no time for that. So, you're full-up? [Semih laughing] Anyway. I should bounce. So how do we exchange our, um... our numbers, do you... Or should we just... I'll put it in right now. So subtle, wow. [both laughing] Yeah, so, with no worries, you can return to your room, and to your girlfriend. Nothing wrong happened. But, you know, I have to get you out of my brain. And I'll deal with that. Just me up there. Just that. [Semih laughing] I'm gonna get going. Great. - Good night. - Yeah, good night. [Defne groans] Good morning. I couldn't find an open florist. [sighing] [exhaling] I am so sorry. - [sniffles] - [softly] I truly am. Tell my grandma yourself. She loved you so much. And it never made sense to me why. - I'm finished with the tattoo. - I don't want one, no way. The hell does that mean? [papers rattling] See? A fish. Dedicated to all the Pisces in the family. - [heavy rain falling] - [Semih] Mm-mm. The Beril you talked about. Who is she? An old friend. Why don't I know her? 'Cause we don't see each other these days. What if someone I don't see anymore texted me? Or if I texted them? [Semih exhaling] Well, I guess I'd ask you who they were, Def. "You're like a store that's open 24/7." "But when you get there, there's always a line." Huh. Mmm. She's funny. But I'm not like that. [annoyed] Did I say anything like that, Defne? Huh? So how do you plan to reply? A smiley face. Smiley face. How am I supposed to reply? I... I'm not done yet. - [exhales] Well, I... - [sighs resigned] I hope every door you find is open for you. Okay, baby? I hope all doors open for you. Then you can hang out in the hallway. That's your thing, right? See? Here's the hallway. - You're breaking my heart. - Enjoy yourself. [Semih] Def? [knocking on door, trying handle] Fine. I picked him up, we're on the road. Okay, Mom? Okay, son. Drive safely. I sent you some tomato paste. Give it to Defne. Okay? - [boy] See you, Mom. - Okay, babies. Fuck the tomato paste. [sniffles] How's Antalya? - It's hot. - Hmm. It's cold here, man, I got the chills when we landed. It is. Where's Defne? Is she around? Nope. We ended it. What? Hey, Gen Z, how can you ask me that? Ooh. Not looking good, brother. Hell you mean? Is she really that angry? Hey, tell me already. Well, dude, she deleted all the pictures on her profile. [scoffs] All of them, for real? Yeah, bro. She really did. But still no bikini photo up yet. What does that mean? Well, "I'm available." Yeah, man. Get your bags and we'll go. On it. Gotta take care of something. What do you say? How much? Nine hundred for you. What? Nine hundred? What does a new one run? Parts are expensive. I'll pay a little more and get a new one. What do you want? - This is for you. - What are you doing, moron? It's from Mom, bro. - Stop, man. - She said you weren't gonna fix it. Please take the money. [doorbell rings] - Poyraz! Come on, man, we got pizza. - [pressing door handle] What do I owe you? Ah, we can work something out, you don't worry about it. - Did you forget I was coming? - Are you serious? Come in. - Hello. Am I interrupting something? Huh? - No. I'll take that. Three years he's been stuck, going nowhere. I'd prefer that than study something I don't like. - Fuck off. He lives on his dad's money. - And what, you aren't? Mine takes care of himself. His dad could take care of everyone. - Different dads, same mom. - Oh, well that's new. Check it. Thirteen years. Look at the two of us. - So what do you want to study? - Molecular biology and genetics. At Bosphorus U. - Oh. - Little man dreams big. That's great. At least he's aiming for something. Let him be. Yes, but he's never thought about where he'd live. I barely make ends meet. - Don't worry about it. - Why don't you take a look around? I mean, it's not my plan to come live here. Oh. - How about studying architecture? - No, just molecular biology and genetics. You're determined. That's great. [Özge chuckles] Kitchen's cleaner than I'd thought. Way to go. [plates clnkring] You guys look sweet. We're over. It's official. If you say so. [footsteps leaving] [magnet hitting floor] [intense music playing] [indiscernible] Look at this design style. You need to make sure you speak about the colors. [indiscernible] This is important. Write this down... [indiscernible] - Just take deep breaths, we'll be fine. - [doorbell rings] - [Hüseyin] Good evening, Semih. - Yeah? We talked about the eviction agreement, remember? - Okay. Thanks, sir. - Take your time. - Thought you'd like a look. - Thanks, sir, yeah. You'd be smart to read these notes in the morning, before you go into the meeting. [traffic noises] Everything's okay, right? All good. Okay. - What? All good. - Okay. Yeah, yeah. SEVCEN REAL ESTATE AGENCY APARTMENTS FOR RENT [game music playing] You think I would've deleted my photos? To begin with, you would need an account, bro. But, everyone's on it. Could be hard for you. Yeah, so if I'd had one? Would I delete them? You would, bro. You'd want her to see your profile, and then get hurt. She's trying to hurt me. For sure, bro. I mean, yeah, you... And then, maybe herself too. To avoid the heartache. [items thrown in bin] [car door opening] [plastic bag rattling] Hey, is this a bikini photo? Yo. You've finally made an account, huh? Give me a follow, bro. Tell you what, do you mind if I don't come? Can I drop you at campus? Is that okay? She's back on the prowl, so all plans go down the drain. That's not it. I have a ton of work to do. Hey, bro? You said that you were gonna move out... Mm-hmm. So what's gonna happen if Defne comes back? She's in for a big surprise, what do you think? She'll find an empty apartment. Not as easy as deleting photos. [engine starts] Look. Are you depressed or something? Why do you keep asking me about this? I was just wondering, bro. Well... Something like that. More or less. [sniffles] That is all I had. Next time you pitch something, stand up so it looks like you give a crap. "Well, something like that." I don't think you even know what you're talking about. From day one, I've been encouraging you, patting you on the back and everything. But nobody's home. We say yes to anything you guys ask for. Don't we? This one's on me. Either it's completely on me, or none of you are in the vicinity of having work ethics, you don't know what teamwork is, and you're clueless! Just leave. We'll talk once I'm calm. - Semih? - Your concepts are garbage. She's right. Are you being cute? How was that what we talked about last night? I take it back. She's wrong. I can salvage this, it's fine. - We'll see what you salvage. - Calm yourself! [door closing] [sighing] [door opening, creaking, closing] [locking door, grunting] [sighing] - [keys clanging] - [huffing] [birds chirping] [traffic passing by] [papers rattling] [rhythmical music playing] [Nazim] Hey, what's up, Seksek? [Semih] All good. You? [Nazim] Good. What's happening? Is Defne back? [Semih] Why'd she be back, dude? You nuts? [Nazim] Why haven't you called me? Thought you made up, so I stopped calling. - [Semih] I told you I was working! - [Nazim] Cool. Find a new place? ♪ Sevcen Real Estate Should take us to a bar ♪ ♪ Sevcen Real Estate Should take us to a bar ♪ [laughing] [music intensifying] [doorbell chiming] [Hüseyin] Oh, Semih. - [muffled] And how are you, sir? - Fine, son, thanks. What's up? - I came to settle that thing, you know. - No need to hurry, my boy. Please, you called my mother. So that you know, I'll be gone in a few weeks. - All right, Semih. - All right. See you. Say hi to Melahat. - See you. Thanks. - Buh-bye. [sexual moaning] [sexual moaning intensifying] [birds chirping] [Semih moaning] Such a gentle touch. [sexual moaning] This place is a bargain for the price, and you can move in now. - More than enough. I like what I see. - The owners are decent. And um, the guy used to be in finance or something. I don't think he's seen the place. He's not rushing things, and he's classy... Should I keep going or what? What's with you? Your ink. Where'd you get it done? It's good. - Well, I know a guy. He's over in Kadikoy. - Hmm. - The talented, but annoying type. - Aha! Yours is nice too, hah. I did most of 'em myself. Ah. Hmm. A bit aggressive, though, but... [Hande moaning] [Hande squealing] [Semih sighing] - Ah, okay. - Okay. [Hande chuckling] [Semih] All right. [both awkwardly laughing] Okay. [Hande exhaling] What do you think, should you come with me to get something to eat? Oh. You're not about to give me the talk, right? Where you say, "You were too hot, I couldn't help myself." That one? No, I'm just saying why don't we get something to eat. Not sure about that. It happens. Next thing you know, I'd ask what happened to the passion, and you'd be screwed, wouldn't you? Listen. I'll move in here, okay? - This is good for me. This is all fine. - You know the deal. Deposit's two months. I don't know if he'll budge. His wife is very sweet, but you can't ever know with these things for sure. Getting to know each other would be a good idea... - Set it up! - All right. My fee isn't negotiable. A month of rent is my finder's fee, even if they help you. Don't get confused because we almost made love, all right? Did I say that? If I fucked every guy I found a place for, this area wouldn't let me live it down. How can you say that? Open the door. Don't think I'm not curious about who it is you're running from. What? You're in a real hurry, so I'm wondering who's been on your tail. It's no one. [traditional music playing] - [Semih] Welcome home. [stops music] - Thank you. [phone dings] Hey, my uncle's asking for an answer. [sighing] Are we officially a no on Hannover? You said you didn't wanna be a pencil-pusher. True. I did. Good for me. [scoffs] We've been over and over this. My opinion hasn't shifted. That place is suffocating. I don't speak the language. What would I do there? But you're definitely free to go. Oh, thanks. I'm aware of that. I've had enough of corporate life, bae. Eh? - Semih, this is my job. - That is not at all what I'm saying. I just mean I don't want that for us. - And those were your words, not mine. - You're not going, so I won't. Okay? Don't do that! Don't you put this on me. It's nothing like that. I told you. You can go if you wish. But I won't be there. I'm not your patsy, let's get that straight. I haven't thought this through. It was all your whining about "euros, euros." Like I'm some slave to money. Your folks have got a pile. Uncle, hey. You're in a meeting? Okay. All right, all right. I'll just tell you. Uh, we talked it through. Well, he's doing well career-wise, so we shouldn't disturb it. - [banging noise] - [Semih grunting] In a few years, maybe. Yeah, but not now. And they told me that I... that I could get assistant manager here. And if I got that, we'd be good. No, we're okay. Yeah, we're good. We'll just be more good. He says hi back. See you. Is that how big my nose is? Hmm. - [spraying] - [seagulls squawking] [ship horn blasting three times] [ship horn blasting five times] So that whole Hannover idea... it's good we dropped it, right? We're in Istanbul, Def. Look around. There's not another one. There's not another me either. [Semi sighing] [Defne sighing happily] - I love you so much. - [giggling] - That felt good. - [both laughing] Please say it again. - [exhaling] I love you so much. - [waves hitting land] [sniffles] How are your dreams of happiness? - Partly cloudy forecast. - [both laughing] But the sun will come out sometime, right? [chuckles] We'll see to it. [both chuckling] - Mmm. - Mmm. [Semih] Mmm.

You been whining about it since this morning, dude. - If you got it covered, I'll take it. - No, give me that. Oh, that's quite sweet. Brother, you are a really great guy, but you've got no sense.

[upbeat music playing] Yeah, we both talked about it, but we actually broke up. Oh. I had no idea. It's okay, man. How could you have known, right? - It's okay. So she's going abroad, huh? - Well, that's what she said. Okay. She'd had it on her mind, so yeah. - I'll see you, bro. - Yeah, see you.

[groaning] Come on, Defne. - I'll call the office and... Semih, stop... - [coughing] Defne! What? What? You're not making any sense. Come on! Get up! - What are you doing? - Don't call anyone. - What are you doing? - I'm going to the bathroom. [groaning] [moaning with discomfort] Hello. We... we need a cab here. [Defne] Okay. At 27 Açelya Street, please. Yeah, we don't need the cab anymore. I called out to the guy from our balcony. [sighs] He didn't hear me. Sorry about that. Thank you. Semih? [knocking on door] Semih, open the door. [annoyed] Semih, are you a damn child? [sighing] [banging] [door creaking, slamming] [rhythmical music playing] [closet door creaking, shutting] Poyraz? - I didn't wanna interrupt your work. - Ah, too late for that. There's this great Swedish DJ doing a set tonight. We'll be there. Okay, that's cool. Wanna come? I thought we could go together. - So... - Oh. No, dude. I mean, I've got all these due tomorrow. I don't know how I could make it. [inhaling] Want me to call Nazim? No, he got us the tickets. We'll go on our own. - Oh? - Oh yeah. All right. Well, cool. - Yeah? - Sure, sure. Have fun. - See you, bro. - See ya. [door closing] Poyraz, have you and Defne recently spoken? Nope. Something wrong? No. No, nothing's wrong. Just wondering. - Okay. - Okay. - Good luck. - Thanks. [slow rhythmical music playing] [phone dings] [lowering volume] [Nazim] Seksek, it's Defne, she's here! - [rave music playing] - Everybody's vibing. Thought you should know. - [presses button] - [music stops] - [rave music playing] - [people talking] Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey! What's up, guys? I told you I'd get him here somehow, didn't I? Nailed it. [Semih] Hey, so, where's Defne? He's asking where she is. Defne's not here, it's just us. It's lit, dude! See how I made him crawl? I told you you can't forget her. [laughs] Hey, let's just have some fun. - Fuck you, man! - Whoa, my dude, calm down, huh? - You're sick, you know. - Hey, Seksek. - What the hell? - Hey, just calm down. - Staying hung up on her isn't helping. - Stop. Let her go. It's chill, it's chill, come on. - What's going on? - I'm fine. Just have to work it out. Come with me. [hard hitting music playing] Are you mad at me because I called Özge, bro? No, this isn't about you. I didn't get what was going on, dude. You couldn't be alone because of me, so I thought I'd call her. No, no, it's got nothing to do with you, and I didn't want that. Thanks anyway. Hey, bro, so I've got this thing with me. - What is this? - Nazim gave it to me. [grunting] - [Nazim] What the hell? - [Semih] You fucking kidding? What's this shit? What is it? I'll kill you! - [Nazim] Shut up! Ow! Let go, dammit! - [Semih panting] [brawling noises] [Nazim] Take it [laughing] - Easy, man. Hey! Easy! Easy! Easy! - Fuck you! [Nazim] Moron. [laughing] [vomiting, coughing] [spitting] [coughing] Go fuck yourself, Nazim! [rave music playing] - [dog barking] - [moped driving] [drunken] Defne. Hello? Hello, brother. I'm Semih. Nice to meet you. See what Defne's up to, huh? Going to Hannover? [sniffles] That's it, I give up. [sniffles] No more, not anymore. Hey, dog, do you know Defne? Gonna throw up! [coughing, spitting] I couldn't throw up. [traffic noises] [crow cawing] [groaning] Uh, I think... I think you're the one I'm supposed to be with. Not think, I know it. Yeah! Here I was, wondering where you'd gotten off to! Here and there and back again. [exhaling] You got coffee? We're closed for the day. [chuckles] Well, I didn't come for the coffee, Ber. - Ber? - Mmm. Could you love on me, you know, just for a little bit? Semih, love? Can you just love on yourself instead? Yeah, I'm aware of that option. - Hmm. - That's easy. [smacking lips] [sighing] Honey, well... you're too late. - Hmm? - Flirting was nice for me too. [inhaling] But now, [smacks tongue] I'm beyond all of that. Why won't it work? I am pregnant. - [laughs] - I'm... I am! Amazing. Could I get that hug now? [Beril] Whoa. [Semih] Mmm. - [headboard banging] - [sexual moaning] [Özge] Semih. Get up, now. We're gonna be late, c'mon. [Semih grunting] [stretching] Morning. [groaning] Yeah, yeah, good morning. Ceyda's gonna rip us a new one. Get up. Yeah? Don't you dare try and judge me, man! [chuckles] What are you laughing at, joker? I've been confused. You know that, dude. And it just so happens that I love myself and the life I live. Okay? What's with the condescending look? I will slap you so hard. I'm not talking, baby girl. Come on, zip it, let's go. For once, I was impulsive. You guys do what you want, but then when it's us... - [knocking on door] - ...doesn't apply. [Defne] I... I'm here to give this to Semih. They brought it to me. Def? Def? Defne? Defne. Defne! Def! Defne! Defne! You're moving to Germany? Huh? - Yes. I am, next week. - Why? Semih, unfortunately, you're not entitled to ask me that, my dear. Is there someone else? Would it be any different if there were? And what about the bikini shots, huh? Is this the Inquisition? No, it isn't! I... It is what it is! Thought you preferred to stay offline, Semih? - Can we talk for two minutes? - What's to talk about? There's nothing to say. - How are you doing? - Good! - Are you really? - What are you asking me? How would I know? You think I know what I'm asking about? Are you over me? We did this yesterday. What? Yesterday? De... Defne? You really don't remember? - You wanted to throw up, but you couldn't. - A dog... But it was a dog. The things people forget. I come home, and Özge is opening the door? - No, she's with Nazim! - Hey, all right, whatever! I just dropped by to give you your phone, now I'm going. - Goodbye. - Def. Def. Hey, just one thing. Did I say something wrong? Just tell me that. No, you didn't. And yet, you didn't say anything right. What was I saying? You're asking me? What you said to me. "Did I mess up? Was I right? Was I wrong in what I did?" Semih, it's you. Always was. Where's Defne? [loudly] Where did Defne go? She's not there! [scoffs] There's no Defne! I was waiting for a sign, Semih. I mean, a sign, something! You didn't even ask me, "Hey, where'd you go?" Huh? You didn't call me. I mean, you sort of did. You did, but [sighs] you don't remember it. It's always your arrogance. You're so wrapped up in yourself, you didn't even worry about me. Forget it, Semih. Forget it. You know the path you're on. Don't leave it. [hard knocking on door] [approaching footsteps] Hey, Seksek! [door shutting] [mug clanging] [Semih] Come again. - Hey, for real? - Yeah, for real, dumbass. Your big brother's here. And you're getting into Bosphorus, I can feel it. - [exhaling] I should be going. - Yeah, go on. - Let me know when you get there. - Okay, bro. - And take this. - Hmm? - What is it? - A cup, man. Give it to Mom. Yeah, for sure. - Okay, I'll see you. - Yeah, bye.. [engine starting] [car driving away] [Semih] Yezo, I'm not feeling well. I know, I know it's due tomorrow, yeah... I don't know! Tell'em my disc got fried, I had a panic attack, anything! I can't finish it in time. What are they gonna do, kill me? I just couldn't. Okay? [traffic noises] [dog barking] [sighing] - [knocking on door] - [cheering on TV-game] [sighing] You haven't moved out. Ceyda? Depression, right? [scoffs] I'm not sure. Think it might be? That girl crushed you when she went. That's not all of it, Ceyda. When she left... I don't really care about your shit, or what you do, or anything else for that matter. Fact is that you gave your word. We're not playing pretend. Get in a ball, cry, whine, and finish what you started. I don't get it, don't you feel a little embarrassed? You assured me you had this and got paid in advance without hesitation. Where is your respect? It's easy to win when you're the one making the rules. That is not real life. I ask myself if you are just lazy or scared of competition? And then I go, "Ha! Why do I care?" Who'd care about this, anyway? Who'd bother? And why should I? Really, why should I even care? But it's not that simple. Life isn't just the path that you're on. Keep your promise and don't damage our friendship, okay? - Ceyda, I'm sure... - Fuck this. [Ceyda sighs] [door slams shut] [Semih] Hello? - [woman] Semih, sweetie? - [Semih] How're you, Mom? [mother] Poyraz told me something. [Semih] Uh-huh? [mother] How're you holding up, baby? [Semih] Good. [mother] So, what happened? Do you wanna talk about it? [Semih] It's nothing. [mother] Son, Poyraz gave me your letter. [Semih] It's not from... [mother] It's from your dad, baby. I know that. But it was addressed to both of us. [Semih] Mom? [mother] Hmm? I went in the bathroom. The day my father left. And there it was. He'd taken everything with him. He had left nothing behind. Like a message he wouldn't return. [mother sighing] He was true to that. He didn't come back. [crying, sniffling] That piece of shit was there the morning Defne left. [mother] Oh, my baby. Why did you take it with you? It was the only thing left from him, why wouldn't I? What's it for? [sighing] We were in Düsseldorf, I guess. We got it there. It's nothing special. I don't think leaving it was deliberate. He left in a hurry, you know. [inhaling] He probably just forgot to take it with him. Wouldn't even part with his sins. [chuckling] They're here. What? The sins. I inherited them. [crying] I can't ask anyone to stay who wants to go. [sobbing] [calm music playing] [sniffling] [Semih sniffling] And what happened with you? [mother] I was sad. - [Semih] I know that. [sniffs] - [mother] What'd you expect, Semih? What would you expect, baby? I was destroyed. You don't need to be scared. He taught me what to do with heartbreak. [Semih] I don't know. You didn't tell me what to do with a broken heart. [mother] Everyone's heartbreak is their own, son. [sad music playing] [Semih] I'm heading out. [Ceyda] And I was just looking over that last job you sent me. Ah, yeah. It's all buttoned up. Yeah, yeah. Congrats, it's a job well done. I need to ask you something. - Hmm? - Why'd you come? Well... I thought you weren't hearing me. That is, I started to think you didn't care enough for your boss. Not to mention, your mom... Elif Hoca, my teacher, means a great deal to me. That's why. Thank you, Ceyda. - Take care of yourself. - Take care. [grunts] [sighing] All right. Here you are. My guitar is yours. - Wait, mine? - Begum's waiting for a call from you. Who's Begum? The guitar instructor. Aw, Semih, you... I can't believe you did that. [calm music playing] [Defne] You can tell my grandma yourself. She loved you so much. And it never made sense to me why. BIRTH: 10.17.1936 - DEATH: 11.11.2018 PRAY FOR HER SOUL [cork clinking] [uplifting music playing] [sighing] I like it. [music intensifying] A CONSTANT ITCHING AGAINST ONE'S NATURE [man] It's, er, popular, I guess. Always is. It isn't that easy. You have to think of tomorrow. Right, sir? You gotta plan ahead. The trips you take... You know. Taking the animal home is easy. But can you care for the animal? You gotta give it some thought. Everyone loves 'em, yeah. But loving them is never enough. You know, even love has its, um... You have to take them for walks, get them to run, and give them whatever they need. [dog barking] But, sir, I have to say, there's something odd about them. They love whoever takes them home. Like love machines. Everyone says they can take care of one. But by the third day, the dog is back on the street. I mean, why would you even adopt it, if you can't care for it? Right, sir? [whimpering] But I got a good feeling about you, sir. You wouldn't abandon 'em, would you? - No, right, sir? - Huh? - You wouldn't abandon it. - No, no. [clears throat] I believe this guy here and I have met before. Yeah? What do you think, bro? - Should I take this one? - [dog whimpering] - [Semih] Rustem. Can I call you Rustem? - [panting] Cool, thanks. We'll see what happens, Rustem. You'll have to deal with me, sometimes. I've just started to learn. I admit it. But you can count on me, Rustem. That's right. You can count on me. [serene music playing] [birds singing] Semih? What? Who's this? Er, Rustem. [giggles] Are you the bad boy type? Ah, look at you. [laughing] How are you? I'm fine. You know. Scraping through. - You? - Good. [chuckles] All settled. In Germany. I'm on vacation this week. I fly back today. That's great. - Glad I bumped into you, Semih. - Me too, yeah. It's so unlikely. What did you do? - Huh? - This thing. "A constant itching against one's nature." - Turgut Uyar. - It's very nice. Always. Ah, but I'm not sure this is what I'd pick for you if it were up to me. Okay. What would you say for me? Don't know. [chuckles] Maybe a firework. And behind it is the darkness. [laughing] I thought you'd told me everything you wanted to say, but... [sniffs] It's good to remember, huh? It's great to remember. Come on, boy. [serene music playing] [sighing] [music fading out]
