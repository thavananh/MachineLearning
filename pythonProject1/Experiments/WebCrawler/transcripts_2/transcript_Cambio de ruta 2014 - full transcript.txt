Okay, who's next? Thank you. This last port survived oblivion. These temples contain images from the gods... Yummy! Smells good! Hey, you're home! Good. - What'd I do without you? - Starve to death. You're right. Hey! My favorite vegetarian food! Today I had the greatest group. There where people from Japan, Spain, US, Saudi Arabia... - Wow! - I took them to the jungle. Remember I used to dive from...? Hey, Nicte, Nicte... Any hunks? Any handsome guy... with whom you'd like to get wild? Come on! Just asking. Wild mambo is very important. The body needs something other than food. Endorphins make you glow. It shouldn't be me preparing your supper. You don't have to. Don't be silly, that's not it. I love doing it. Anyways, you should wear some make up. A little eyeliner. Anything. It's been a long time. You'll forget how to use it. I can't believe we're having this conversation. Doesn't matter. While the time comes... - you can be self-sufficient. - No way, mom. Just let me show you. - Just take a look. - Forget it. - Okay. - Thanks. I'll set it right here. Let's have a nice supper. Just let me tell you there's a new product. - Really? - It's great. It's called "Papa Smurp". - "Papa Smurp". - I've sold three this week. - No way! - There must be a reason. Of course. I don't think "Papa Smurp" is for me. Okay, but I'll leave it right here. Good morning. - Hi. - Good morning. - This is for me, right? - Yes. Thanks. EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH Thanks for joining me today. I'm glad we're all here. I have great news. But, before we start just as we do every month... we'll acknowledge the employee of the month. The employee of the month is... our dear Nicte Flores. - Thank you. - Congrats, Nicte! This is the 18th month in a row that you are... the employee of the month at Tours Tours. - Congratulations! - Thanks. - Here you go. - Thanks. Give her an applause. Now, I'd like to share some news with you. You know this job takes courage and commitment. I still got the courage, but I'm lacking the other one. So, after a millionaire offer I got... We're getting a raise. Well, actually, no. My friends, I've decided to sell this company. But, don't you worry. Your jobs are safe. You're the best tourist guides in the Mayan Riviera. You'll be working under a new administration. The new owners will come talk to you tomorrow. Thank you, really, for your commitment. You all live in my heart. See you. - Where are you going now? - To the Bahamas. - Really?! Wow! - Yes. My regards to your wife. - I won't see her soon. - Did you have a fight? Nope. Don't tell anybody. I'm taking my new friend, Natasha. Hum, well... lots of changes, huh? It's never late to fulfill your dreams. - Being a tourist? - More or less. A billionaire divorcAc, with a permanent suntan... and if I get lucky... might appear on an elite magazine. You might, yes. Well, hum... good luck. Work is not everything, you must have a life. - Okay? - I will. This is my life. - See you, precious. - Bye. Good luck. - Did he say Bahamas? - Yes. He's stupid. What's in Bahamas to beat this place? Nothing really. Maybe he just needs a change. - What about me? - What about you? You want to go with him? These changes never work out for the better. Our pay could go down or we could draw the short straw. How about a little positive energy? He said everything will be fine. You always see the dark side. Because I know them... - Paul? - Hey, how was your trip? Fine, thanks. Did you get the Canopic vases? Yes. Just want to make sure... they're in the correct order. Paul, there are only 3 sets of 4 vases. They're aligned as in a crime scene. What do I do? Set the flat capped ones in a corner. The ones from the first middle period... are the ones with the human heads. Set the ones of Orus' children horizontally... So people can see the Gods' heads. How do I arrange the organs? There's not a set order. I don't know. Stomach, bowels, lungs and kidney. There's no vase for the heart? No. The heart was left inside the mummy. It's the soul's core. Come on, you know all this. Anyways, did you finally read your dad's letter? "Dear Cristobal, I worked hard to ensure..." a good future for you and your mother. However, when she died, I was lost and moved away. Now, at the end of my road, I realize I gave up... what was most important. I missed out on a lot of things. Unfortunately, my time is running out... and I won't be able to make it up to you. You must now you've always been my inspiration. I hope you'll forgive me and remember... the happy times we shared with your mom. Now that I'll be gone, I need you to take care... of Arroyo Tours Associates. The Tourism Division IS NOW... at the Riviera Maya developing a project. Go check on it and see that this new administration... lives up to the values that have made this company... "what it is today. Love, your father." - Excuse me. - Yes? - You work here? - Yes. You're dressed like Indiana Jones. Cute. But this is no disguise contest. I don't get it. I'm in charge of the company's image. You know, presence, style, power. We've got to do something about this. It works for me. Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon. Today is a very important day in Arroyo Tours. We're pleased to greet you, professionals... in the hospitality of the Riviera Maya. I'm Victoria, your new Director. I'm here to tell you that as of today... we will work together, heart to heart. You won't be just employees anymore but associates. Yes, that's right. Arroyo Tours associates. You won't have to worry about salaries... or overtime anymore, as you will get... a 0.005% shareholding. So, let's welcome this new era. Starting next week, you'll be receiving training. Simple safety and confidence requirements... for both you and us. Any questions? Okay, then. Besides changing the company's image... in order to obtain identity and standing... we will modify the food supplies as well... as we're missing an opportunity bias there. Ms. Jones... what's your real name? Nicte. Very well, "Nike", come to the front. Come on, don't be shy. Okay, we'll do an exercise. You'll be a client and I'll be your tourist guide. I'm the tourist guide. I know, it's just role-playing. It's make believe, just to make a point. Think you can do it? Okay. Two steps back. Go on, further back. Now come. Hey! How are you doing today? Welcome to Arroyo Tours! This week we have 2 for 1 in all beverages. Great opportunity. Would you like something to eat or drink... before going on this super exciting tour? No. Okay. This could happen and in this case... better not insist. Note your stops should be in spots with no shades. This way you'll promote beverage consumption. Okay, "Nike", let's try it once again. Go back. Further back. Now. Now. Hey! How are you doing today? Welcome to Arroyo Tours! This week we have 2 for 1 in all beverages. Great opportunity. Would you like something to eat or drink... before going on this super exciting tour? No. I don't think you're getting it, darling. - You should say yes this time. - No. Say again? I don't like your game. It's harmful to health... and to the environment. Don't give me that look, you don't like it either. Everything okay? The Big Boss is here. Cristobal Arroyo is on his way. Cristobal Arroyo... as in Arroyo Industries? The very same. I've met him. He's a "'museum worm". He works at the New York Met. He's an anthropologist. Nothing is by chance, Victoria. We'll see. I hope he's here just to visit pyramids. - Hello. - He's here. - I'd like to see the manager. - Come with me. Smile. Let's go. Welcome to Play a del Carmen. I'm Victoria. We met at a convention in Paris. Long time ago. - So, how was your trip? - Fine, thank you. - Everything went smoothly? - Yep. This is Julia Guerra. She's in charge of the corporate image. Hello. - Welcome. - Hello. So, would you like us to show you around? Sure. It's for today, people! Come on! That woman needs a kilo of poc chuc. Next? God, they're slow! Oh, good, it's cool here. The use of air-conditioning, besides being an expense... doesn't help us make the clients thirsty. Take a sheet. You look nice in the uniform. You do. Okay, let's start. You're acquainted with the new standards of ISO 9001. How would you apply them and what would be... your idea of an effective benchmarking? - Are these the questions? - Yes. Is there a problem? Being a tourist guide is much more than this. It's about architectural wonders, nature. It's sharing those things with tourists. Sharing our ancestor's history. - It's much more than... - Okay, she has no idea. What is the tourist influx rate for the last 15 years... for the Riviera Maya? You don't know? What does that have to do? A lot, my dear "Niche", a lot. Don't take this personally. I mean, it's nothing against you. This is called "corporate vision". We need our associates to have it in order to grow. Okay, that I can study but... let me show you what I know. Please. No, darling, go study and then you show us, okay? - Thank you. - Thank you, "Nize". - Next. - It's Nicte. Nicte. Next is Dimento and he won't know... those answers either. - Next. Dimitri. - Dimento. Your turn! Oh boy!! Look at his hair! We must do his hair. Julia, I need a word with you. Darling, your attitude doesn't help much. Want to keep your job? Start studying... and leave the rest of the business to us. That's our thing. Demetrio needs polishing, by the way. Do you know how long it takes for a cigarette butt to degrade? Do you know what it is like to work with this heat... wearing these uniforms? You're a business expert but, you have no idea about Mayan culture. How dare you! Are you making a scene? I give a shit about your thoughts! If you don't like our changes the door is wide open. Actually, I don't like your changes. I don't like the way you treat people... nor how you treat the environment! So, I quit. What's going on? We just saved one compensation. I could see that coming. - If it's not good, better gone. - Of course. Hey, those are Gucci's latest, right? One more. What is it, sweetie? I've never seen you like this. I' need to talk to my dad. I'm waiting for him. If I tell you now, I'll start crying and lose composure. I hate her Spanish accent... and her shitty ISO standards! She said Dimento needs polishing. Maybe a bit, but I'd do it. Or better not. Tourists love him just like he is. Benchmarking! Bench-marking! I don't get you, but here comes your dad. Vent your sorrows as I think you're a bit drunk. Did you like the show my rain deer? It's an excellent song, right? Hey, come on, let's talk. Tell me everything. - Anything else? - Thank you. I like the place. I saw it yesterday. Jazz in the middle of Play a del Carmen, huh? It's not New York, but it's okay. What I find great is your being here. Cheers! You're the Godfather of our growth in Mexico. - To the Godfather then! - Cheers! So, are you visiting the pyramids? I can be your guide if you like. I've learned a lot lately. It could be fun too. Of course, but... I'd like to relax a bit too. Sure, you relax and enjoy. We're here to do the hard work. You can come to the office anytime. Even better, Julia will prepare a briefing... So you know what's going on. That'd be great. If it's not too much to ask. No problem. I can bring it to your hotel. Thanks. By the way, I left my things at your office. - Is there someone there? - Sure, Pedro will help you. Do you mind if I print? From my computer? No problem. Would you like company? No, thanks. I'd like to walk a bit on my own. You two stay and have fun. I think I drank a bit too much. You know... I can't keep working at a place with heartless people. They're not aware of the importance of... sharing. My boss and I are opposites. I love being a tourist guide but I can't stay there. - Well, don't. - That's the point. I quit. I'm officially unemployed. I think this is your big break. - Come on, dad. - Of course it is. You know the trade, you're the best at it. It's time for you to grow. And growing hurts, honey. But you must do it. It's time for you to go on your own. To pursuit your dream. You think I'm capable of doing so? Absolutely. Although you won't go on your own today. You'll stay over at our place. MEGA COMPLEX ARROYO RESORTS 1,500 HECTARES, 2 GOLF COURSES What is this? Leave the package aside. Very well. Now, slowly move it closer to your "untulu". It's Mayan. Okay, we'll call it "cocoon". Very well. Make sure it has batteries. It should vibrate. Give me a sec, princess. I was talking to my daughter. I have the duck, which is waterproof, and the bunny... - Do you feel better? - Yes. Elo? - I think she found it. - You're a genius! Poor Elo. So long using it and she didn't... know what it was for. Anyways, your dad told me. It's good you quit. That company wasn't for you. I agree with your dad. You need to start your own business. That's right. Celery juice. Great moisturizer. - Oh, no, mom! - It is. You need a new vision board. Get your goals in there. You know I trust these things. They always work. What should I write? I'm lost. Think positively and positive things shall come. Decreet! Chin up, honey. Darling, we'll always be here for you. Take it easy. Okay, get your act together. There's a lot to do. Drink your juice. Hangover? Nothing better than a fresh juice. - And a good orgasm. - Mom! You're right. Car me lit... How's the job treating you? They're exploiting us. I work overtime... and they told me I need brackets. That sucks! Poor you! I could get run over by a bus... and you wouldn't care, huh? I mean, you didn't even call. - It's just... - It's okay, I'm better now. Good thing you can make it up to me. It's called karma. Oh, come on. Let's start our own business. Let's be partners. No bitches around, no uniforms, no brackets. People with heart. I don't know. Come on! I'm doing it. But without you, you know I need spice in my life. Who spices up my life? Who? Who? - Who? - You're being cruel. You're right. Come on! Please please. Do it for me? We need loads of money to do that. Have you seen the look on the tourists after our tour? They love it. Tips! We got tips! We have to go for it. It's now or never. Come on! Let's do it. - Our own business. - Yes! It's like going on the zip line. At first you're scared, but then, you relax. - I can't say no. - Who are you talking to? Shush! Don't interrupt. I'm talking to Big us. Big us? My shaman suggested to give voice to my inner child. - And you call him Big us? - Yep. Dimento... Big us... I need you. Let's start our own business. One... Two... 50-50. 50-50! - You share your 50 with Big us. - Deal! Let's go! Let's go! Oh, Nicte! My princess. Princess, my ass! My queen! What wouldn't I do for you! Let me warn you, the bus is not at its best. It needs spare parts and stuff. But, better a bird in hand than... You'll like it. Okay, where is it? What happens if you throw a duck in the water? Don't know. What? It swims. A duck. A duck. A duck. A duck. A duck. Look at this beauty! Specially for you, princess! What do we need to get it going? A miracle. Must change the brakes, the clutch, the gear-box... the radiator, the upholstery. Just minor details, right? Minor details, yes. So, my young entrepreneurs. Scully and Mulder checking their X Files! We're in a bit of a rush. So, I once had a dream and I woke up... as the alarm clock rang. I realized I had to pick up my business. I would've been like him. A bit shorter and funnier. But I'm fucking used to eat 3 times a day. So, okay, how much? An eye for an eye. 64 million pesos... and 47 euro cents. What do you say? Just kidding. It'll cost a lot but... We have an offer for you. You won't be able to resist. You give us the truck for free... and we'll make your dream come true. Cristobal! I have some questions about your project. Of course. Shoot. Do you have to destroy a big area of mangrove swamps... - to go through with it? - Well, yes. Sacrifices, sacrifices. We need that territory. Some hectares are not as important... a sit is to feed hundreds of people. Feeding hundreds of people? You don't know how many people are involved here. There's a lot of poverty. Would you rather have swamps or children... having access to education and health services? It doesn't have to be that way. Yes it does. Forget about romanticism. This is reality. We're talking about lots of families yours included. Besides thousands of employees. I don't get what's the problem? I'll go through the conditions again... and we'll talk. Okay. Okay. What else? We must think about things the others don't offer. Besides asking them to push the truck... we can offer an all-inclusive experience. All-inclusive? Yes, as it includes an expert on spring-breakers... called Dimento. You say "jump" and I say "how high". And it also includes a very handsome man... along with imaginary friend. - No? - Big us? - He's not included. - He's not, okay. So, let's visualize. Let's think if we ask the Universe... everything is possible. Visualize and carry through. That's how things work. What are you doing? What's this contest about? Tour Guide is the major international... tourism magazine. Registrations are per destination. Hey, it's only them here! To improve their service, they need competition. But they are a "Monopholy". "Monopoly", remember? You know what? We must put an end to this. - So he wants to help? - Now he is enthusiastic. It turns out he's interested in everything that goes on here. I gave him some papers to keep him busy. I've invested a lot of time in this project... for him to come and hinder it. The truth is he's a hunk. He has a naA-ve air. He could use a good fuck. Hey, nice! Now we're talking! That's the attitude! That'll get him off our backs. You know everything that is at stake here. Down to business then. - Hi there! - Hi. How are you? I know a great Yucatan food restaurant. Join me for supper and we can talk shop? Thanks but I have lots of work. Is that it or you don't like Yucatan food? I know a Spanish restaurant too. I love Yucatan food. Some other time? Promise? Sure. Destroying 200 hectares of mangrove swamps just like that? Well, the poverty... I know there's poverty here... but there must be something we can do. I don't know, maybe... Find out about fines, international permits... the impact on the environment. Hey, how about that guy? - Him? - We have nothing to lose. - Okay, let's try. - Cool. Hello. - Hello. - Sorry for the delay. Are you ready for your best tour ever? We guarantee we'll take you to awesome places. Sinkholes, mangrove swamps, natural reserves. - Mangrove swamps? - Yes. Your timing is perfect. - I'm Nicte, your tourist guide. - Cristobal. I'm Dimento. Together we are Nicte Tours. - Ready? - Ready. Ready. - Let's go! - Let's go! Is this your first time in the Riviera Maya? I was here as a kid, but it has changed. True. It has changed a lot. My dad used to bring us here. I liked it was not crowded. That's nice. I like this place. I feel positive, energized, you know. I know my way around here, you'll have fun, trust me. Careful! Don't touch that tree. That one. This is a Chechen. Mayans used to tie non-natives... Ito it as 1t oozes a toxic resin which can cause... - even third degree burns. - Really? Unfortunately it's not done anymore. - Excuse me? - I meant, fortunately. Now, the only way to heal a burn caused by the Chechen... Is using the Chacah, which is this tree right here. This one. - Are they always together? - Always. Nature is wise. Always, next to a Chechen is a Chacah. That's interesting. Let's go. I've always been amazed by this caverns. It's as if Julio Verne had been inspired by them. How is it a drop of water can make this forms? It's amazing. Look. There is Dimento. And a heart there. In all cultures... the heart has always been most important. Don't tell me you're a tourist guide too? No, I'm an anthropologist. I thought you were after my job. For real, an anthropologist? You must know much more than me. Not about these places, but I can tell you... the heart has always been sacred in every culture. Did you know organs were kept in different vases? The heart was left inside the corpse. That's why the heart is the top offering. How about if we stop thinking for a while... and just let ourselves go with the water flow. Come. Float face up. Play dead. - Did you eat lead? - I'm no good at playing dead. Let yourself go, I'll hold you. Okay. Word says, 65 million years ago, the peninsula... was underwater and a meteorite pushed it out. There's a lot we don't know. That's why I love the past. People were wiser. For starters, they took care of the planet. We don't. That makes me angry as I believe Earth is our home. It's was gives us meaning, what holds us. Life is full of surprises. True. Life is full of surprises. - Best tour ever. - This is awkward. We now. Tell your friends. On the contrary, it's embarrassing. We owe you. We wanted to take you to more places. Nic, this is broken. Hey, I had a great time. No way I could repay you. - Big tip. - You're right. It's called gratitude. Nothing to thank us for. We ought to pay you. Say what? Thank you, really. In fact, sorry for the inconveniences. We're just starting. This was our first tour. - Really? - You're our back man. You should be proud. Actually we are. It's just a matter of fixing some minor details. No problem. Close it. Ready? Let's go! Once again, sorry for the inconveniences. To make it up, we'd like to take you meet our sponsor. We won't take no for an answer. Your sponsor. Yes, the chubby guy with the cigar. She says he's a great comedian. I could make it on Friday. I can use some smiles. Great. Great. Doubly great. Thank you, Cristobal. Here, this is our number. Hire us again or recommend us. There's her number too. Next time, I promise this bus won't break down. - Thanks again. - You're welcome. - See you soon. - Okay. - Bye - Bye. Okay, let's go. Thank you. - Hello, Julia. - Hello, Cristobal. I went shopping and found the perfect glasses for you. Thanks. You shouldn't have. - Nice hotel, huh? - A bit excessive. You'd rather have a straw roof and sand in your bed? - Maybe. - I see. When I first got here, I found local stuff charming. Then, time goes by and you realize they are not like us. They are too simple-minded to understand. Sometimes I am too simple-minded to understand. You consider yourself simple? As simple as that. Need me to explain? I didn't see that coming. If you need more explanations... I see you need to rest and a shower. - Good morning. - Morning, Nicte. What might be his sign? Sign? Cristobal's sign. What do you think? If my ancestors don't fail me... I think he might be... Tzootz. - Bat? - Yes. He looks like one. He doesn't look like a bat. Either he is a Moan or a Dzec. Owl or Scorpion? Which gets along with the peacock? - Now I get it. - So? What would you like him to be? Scorpion. When you feel that energy, you just feel it. Everything has meaning. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think so. It was quite real. He has beautiful eyes. You like him? Let me remind you scorpions sting. - With their tail. - You're so bitter. Just saying. Just taking care of you, but suit yourself. Great job, you're a great partner. Get some rest. See you. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. - Sorry for being late. - I just got here. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. Hello. Anything to drink, sir? Of course. Ladies first. - What are you having? - Me? Bloody Mary... do you have celery? - Yes. - Two sticks. - You? - The same, two sticks too. Okay. - How's the job? - Very well, we're doing fine. In fact, if you like, after the show... there's a beautiful place I'd like to show you. I owe you part of the tour. You owe me nothing. It was great. But we can go. Here's Johnny! He's our sponsor. Hello! I'm Johnny, but I like my friends to call me... Johnny. It's a pleasure being here with you. We always have people from all parts of Mexico... and from all around the world. - Where are you guys from? - Spain. Spain. Just remembered a story about two Spanish friends. They were hunting. One says to the other: "Did you see that dead seagull?" Benancio goes, "where, where?" Now, I have a friend who is a great tourist guide. She's quite witty. Once she came up with a... tour for cross-eyed people. So, on the bus she goes, "if you turn to your right"... you'll see the ocean to your left". You know what an iguana said to another iguana? We're iguanitas. Did you know mangrove swamps do miracles? They do? How? They're the habitat of fish and shrimp. They absorb the sediments that kill corals. They absorb contamination, prevent erosion. They are a wall to contain hurricanes and storms. I didn't know all that. Hey, look! What's that shinning in the water? That's a "noctiluca", a protozoan. They shine in the ocean. - Can I touch it? - Yes. Come, I'll show you. Amazing! I can't believe it. I've never seen anything like it. This is one of my favorite spots. My mom used to bring me here as a child. I'd spend hours looking at them. I called them sea fireflies. It's magical. In fact, I had never brought anyone here. I'm lucky then. - Hey, Samuel, how are you? - Very well. Good seeing you! How's the job going? - It's been 20 days already. - 20 days! I can't believe how time flies! I think initiative is key in this business. - You think so? - I do. So, I need you to do me a favor. Would you promote these brochures for me? I promise you won't regret it. Tourists will love them. Kukulcan will be mad. What if I get caught? We have a contract with Arroyo Tours. Well, they don't offer what we do. Besides, they won't know. In the remote case they did... you can tell them tourists couldn't resist... these super brochures. Just look at them. They're great! - May I ask you something? - Sure. - Are you pro monopolies? - No way! I knew it! When I first saw you, I thought... this guy supports and values local work. - Oh, Nicte! - Come on! Our basic services are almost 40% above the average. I'm sure by the end of the year... our annual profit will exceed that 40% We're working on it. If we want our profit to keep going up... we must keep that growth rate. What would the growth plan be? Well, first we must win the Tour Guide contest. That's a fact as we have no competition. That will put us in the map of international tourism. Well... Besides the contest, what does the plan imply? I'm telling you, darling. It's step by step. First step is to win the contest. That's why we are expecting Mr. del Castillo. It's important for you to trust me, Cristobal. I know what I'm doing. I won't risk the company's interests. - You're getting all wet. - Thanks. - What's distracting you? - Nothing. Can I ask you a big favor? I must turn in these papers and I need a witness to sign... - or they won't accept them. - What are they? It's just a list of people who don't meet... our job requirements. They don't meet certain criteria, like Mr. Perez... who failed the first aid exam. That's risky. Anyways, it's nonsense. - I'll find someone else. - I'll sign them, no prob. Besides, Victoria is accountable... you'd be only a witness. Okay. - There you go. - Thanks. I owe you one. You don't say! That's terrible. It is. Would you please help me? Of course, girl, I'll help. Schedule an appointment in this book. Nobody told me I needed an appointment! You do in order for us to assist you... just like you deserve. Besides, you need to bring all proofs and documents... So we can proceed. How long does this take? - 10-15 business days. - Say what! That's too long! I need to work! Did your license expire? No, it was revoked. "Nike"! How is it going for you as a freelance? You should know. You revoked my license. - I have to get a new one. - Poor thing! - One never knows who to trust. - It was you who revoked it! I wish I had that power. Better check who signed those papers. Good luck, Indiana Jones. Oh, my regards to your friend Cristobal. Dimento. What! Here he comes. This won't take long. How do you dare! How could you! Do you think I'm stupid? Best tour ever! Best week ever! What a nerve! You tricked me! Well done, Cristobal Arroyo! - I don't... - Aren't you Cristobal Arroyo? You're to blame for my license being revoked! I can't enter the contest thanks to you! You want to keep everything! Keep the Riviera Maya for yourself! You deserve it! - Listen... - Shut up! I don't want to see you ever again! You used me. The connection I felt with you wasn't real. Go to hell! - Hey, what's wrong? - My license was revoked. I'm out of the contest. It's in four days. No can do without my license. Maybe it's just bad timing. Obstacles in life are for us... to prove our passion. If this is what you're passionate about... it'll happen. I dreamed about my band... and my dream came true. We do great. Most important, Nicte... I'm happy because I do what I like. But I can't do anything about this. It's not just about my career. - I want people to see this. - There's always a way. I remember the first time we went to Chichen. You were 5 and you told me: "Dad, I want to be a tourist guide"... and you are. You're a fighter. You're a first class tourist guide. Thanks, daddy. - I love you. - I love you, honey. So, let's get to work. When the going gets rough... OK. - Nic, we need the permit. - I know. So, what's the plan? - Won't you pick up? - I don't want to. He's been calling all day. I'm not up to it. Period. I have an idea. We enter with no license. When they check, you'll have the new one. Besides, they will love our tour for sure. The license is just a minor detail. You think? Come on, who's straight in this country? What if... If we ask, a "no" is for sure. We're striving for a "yes". I don't know. We have nothing to lose. We have no job. We have no one to answer to. Okay, let's do it! We'll sign up and we'll win! - That's the attitude! - Right! - Pick up. Poor guy. - No. He's a traitor. Now he's a traitor. Before he had beautiful eyes... he was an owl who gets along with a peacock. Stop it or you and I will have problems. We must focus on our work and on winning that contest. Okay, I'll sign us up as it was my idea. And you're not yourself today. Hey! Hey! I love you. What would I do without you? Thanks for coming. I was panicking over... meeting the judge. - It's okay. Don't worry. - Good morning. - May I ask you...? - We didn't order yet. It's for the gentleman. - Oh, God! That's him, right? - Yes. Hey, youngsters, how are you? - Nice to meet you. - I'm your fan. Thanks. - How are you, young man? - Fine, thank you. - Good. So, what's up? - We're waiting for the judge. Well, here I am. I'm the judge. That's right. I love the Riviera Maya. I did lots of soap operas here. It's one of the most beautiful places in the world. I've done my share of traveling. This place is wonderful, yes. We're trying to have quality tourism here. I hope people value it. Of course, we'd do better with your support. Oh, you have it easy. - You have almost no competition. - Almost? Yes, this girl, what's her name... - Nicte. - Right, she signed up too. She used to work for you but now she's on her own. That's not possible. I think it is. She has her own bus now. You shouldn't support someone without a license. What happened with her license Julia? Hey, you know. You signed her revocation. Well, hers and some others. Nic! There you are! We were supposed to meet. - Are you okay? - Yes. Well, not really. What Cristobal did really hurt. The beautiful-eyed guy. I hate him, I love him, I want to kill him. I want him out of my heart. Chin up, Nic. Time heals everything. - I'm so stupid. - You are not. It's just you give your heart too soon. He used me. He used us to know our places. You know, it's good I'm alone. You're not alone. You're a great woman. You have me and Big us. Let's go win this contest. It's good you're here with us. A member of the Arroyo family will make... the investment more reliable. It's important you support our initiatives. Is that our competition? Please! Isn't that Cristobal over there? Oh, yes. I don't care. How frivolous! - Where did she get that bus? - I don't know, Victoria. - Just forget him. - Shush! He's not worth it. Who would get in that thing? And she has no license. That's serious. It's important we adhere to the standards. They're here. Go get the judge. Nice tour, Julia. - You're a darling. - Our pleasure, judge. Remember, traveling with us... you get discounts in shopping outlets. Yes, yes. Thank you. - Mr. Eric del Castillo? - Yes. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Are you the judge? - Yes. I'm Nicte Flores, tourist guide. - You're Nicte? - Yes. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. - Ready? - Give me a sec. - Just one stop. - Will it take long? I'm going to pee. Won't take long. Sure. Did you see who that was? - Mr. del Castillo! - Hi, Victoria. - How are you? - Very well. - Did you enjoy the tour? - Yes, it was nice. Good. Just one thing. If you're taking another tour... make sure everything's in order. Yes, of course. Thank you. - No problem. - Well... If you'll excuse me, I have an important matter to tend to. See you. Mr. del Castillo! How was it? - Very nice. - Good. Now you have to go with Nicte. - There's a lot to see yet. - Really? Forget about standards. Keep your heart and eyes wide open. - You won't regret it. - I promise I'll go. It changed my life. My life will change too if you don't let me go pee. Oh, excuse me. Okay, we must keep calm. Act normal... Here he comes. - Here he comes. - Mr. del Castillo. I'm ready. Nicte Flores. - I already introduced myself. - Love your name. - We welcome you. - Thank you. This is my partner, Dimento. - Dimento? - Dimento. Nice to meet you. - This is my mom, Rosita. - Beautiful lady. - Nice to meet you. - My pleasure. The girls from the Riviera Maya chorus. - Chorus girls? - Yes. Let's get rolling, girls. - How do I get in? - Through the back. Let's go. You'll experience lots of things today. Seats provide a massage too. We have several emergency exits... And if you need some oxygen... just stick your heads out the windows. I'm just kidding. Welcome to the tour. Thank you. Do you trust me, Don Eric? Sure, girl. Why? I'm blind folding you. We'll play a bit with your 5 senses. Will I be okay? You'll be fine, promise. I'll ask you to hold my hand as I'll be guiding you. - Oh, God. - Let's go, girls. - Blind man's bluff? - That's right. Ready for seeing your soul? - Am I dying? - No. Okay. Breathtaking! - Are we walking here? - Yes. - Let's do it. - Be careful. Is it fun doing soap operas, Don Eric? It's nice, yes. Stop, Dimento. Pull over. Pull over. Hi, sir. Come little one, we'll give you a ride. Come on, get in. Ready? Let's go. Long walk? A bit. Thanks, Miss. - Are you speaking Mayan? - Yes. It sounds nice. Is he the guy who appears in soap operas? Yes, he is. He looks taller on TV. Bye-bye! - Bye-bye! - Bye-bye! Sorry, that wasn't scheduled. On the contrary, it's good we gave them a ride. It's giving something in return. This is their land, and they let us be here. It's a way of saying thank you. My ice-cream is delicious. It's coconut flavor. So is mine. You must be proud of your daughter. I am. She wanted to be a tour guide... since she was little. She gets post-cards from all over the world. Tourists love her. She was born to be one. You just said it. Would you mind taking a picture with my friends? The chorus girls? Of course not! - I've been an actor a long time. - I see. Let's see. Thanks for everything, Nicte. It was a wonderful tour. You're the best tour guide ever. Thank you, sir. My pleasure. There's something I'd like to confess. - Okay. - My license expired. But my new one is coming along. I know it's a must, but it's almost ready, I'm sure. Thanks for your honesty but... things are not up to me. There's a jury. But I'll try to help you. Thank you! Thank you! Don't get so excited. We'll see. But I'll tell you one thing. It had been a long long time since I had such a good time. You made me feel a child again. Just look at me. God bless you, girl. Likewise. Take care. Listen to me, please. - What do you want? - I didn't know I was... revoking your license. I would never do that. Is that what you have to say? I don't care. It's late. I'll win that contest. I know, but I wanted to tell you I'd never hurt you. I think of you all day long. In your eyes, in your smile. I want to be with you... and you know it. If I had a vase, I'd put my heart in it and give it to you. I don't care, so keep your heart as I don't trust you. Stop calling me. He betrayed me. He lied. - Did you listen to him? - Of course I did. I know you, darling. You get angry and you get inside a shell. I think he's a nice guy, who loves you. Honey, relationships are based on communication. But true communication means... you speak and the other one listens... and then the other way around. You think your dad and I haven't felt like... killing each other sometimes? But we love each other. We have controlled our guts. If you love him, which I think is the case... go for it. Stop acting like a child, don't be afraid. Don't miss the chance to live it. - Fancy, huh? - It is. - Mosquitos will feast on us. - I'm nervous. There he is. Of course he is. It's a great night for us. - It is? - Of course. I'll make it simple for you. Arroyo Tours is a tiny company... run by one of the major corporations worldwide. Arroyo Industries. Among other things, it builds luxurious complexes in... let me see... oh, yes, in the Riviera Maya. So in the hypothetic case you won tonight... all this will be ours. I think you've given your last tour. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Please take your seats, our ceremony is about to start. Thanks for joining us tonight. - There's the winner. - Sweetie. What's going on? Very well, it's Mexico's turn. To grant this award, let's welcome Mr. Eric del Castillo. Good evening. It's a great honor for me to be here tonight... to grant the Tour Guide Award to the best... tour guide in Mexico. I'm aware of the importance of treating tourists right... and of sharing all the riches of your own places. But a good tour guide goes beyond that. He is someone who knows well his country's treasures. Someone who makes you feel good. Someone who allows you to open your senses... your soul, your heart to contemplate... beauty at its fullest. Someone so passionate about his work... that he transmits it to the tourist. Well, ladies and gentlemen... as you know this is an international contest... Subject to all standards and regulations. This is why tonight, the Tour Guide Award goes to... Arroyo Tours, at the Riviera Maya! - Congratulations, Cristobal. - Thank you, Eric. Good evening, I'm Cristobal Arroyo. I'm a member of the Board of Arroyo Industries. Nicte, don't leave. I need you to listen. Arroyo Industries is a guest at the Riviera Maya. My company is here to take care of the ecosystems... to contribute to sustainable development... it would never destroy mangrove swamps. Do you see that lady standing there? She ought to receive this award. It's hers. She's the best tour guide in the world. She taught me this land IS our home. It's what's gives us meaning, what contains us. Our roots. Here's my heart. It's yours. You know it. We can't let this feeling slip away. It's special. It's magical. It's from other lives. Let me take care of you. I miss you a lot. I love you. I love you too. What did she say? She said "I love you too". Congratulations!
