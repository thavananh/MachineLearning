Another poor bloke that fell out of line. We better bloody well keep you on your feet. [explosions in the distance] - Halt! - Halt! [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [engine revving] Okay. Okay, okay.. [explosions] I know what you're thinking about, sir. But don't try it. Haven't got much choice. This leg's stiffing up on me. I shall be able to move it tomorrow. - Then what should we do? - We'll get you through, sir. On one bowl of soup you had two days ago? You've got enough to do to look after yourselves. [speaking in foreign language] Think I'm gonna take a nice little walk. It's too dangerous, sir. [whispers] Oh, shut up. [explosions] [twigs crack] [twig cracks] [explosions] [instrumental music] [male narrator] There was a man named Charlie Coward. An ordinary soldier with an ordinary background. But sometimes, as a man who stands out from the crowd. He's more resourceful, more daring and more determined than the others. Sergeant Major Coward was one of these. This is his story. [music continues] [explosions] [speaking in foreign language] [car honking] [dramatic music] [music continues] [speaking in foreign language] [dramatic music] [speaking in French] Anglais. Anglais!

Im namen des Fuhrers 'Gut mein Sohn.' Gut mein Sohn. [speaking in foreign language] Im Namen des Fuhrers [speaking in foreign language] - Hm? - Geben Hand. [speaking in foreign language] Achtung! [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [all shouting in foreign language] [train chugging] [harmonica music] [indistinct chatter] Hey, lads, sergeant's got something here. [chuckles] As soon as this bloody thing stops, we'll all be off. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [blowing horn] [speaking in foreign language] [air hissing] [shouting] - Why are we stopping. - The train is stopping. [indistinct chatter] [harmonica music] [indistinct singing] It just isn't safe. [whistling] Who did this? Who hacked the wagon, hm? It's those bleeding mice you got around here. You know, we nearly lost him just now. - You are in charge here? - Well, I was, yeah. It's sabotage! This is the last time I travel by this road, I tell you that for a start. [indistinct chatter] Oh, that's not first class. [indistinct chatter] [train horn blaring] Hey, sarge, that's a ammunitions train.

Home sweet home. Still, in comparison with those death factories or concentration camps life here really wasn't.. ...really wasn't too bad. As a matter of fact, we even had our own little palladium. We were allowed letters from home. Sports and above all, sometimes we got parcels from the Red Cross. The food in these packages often meant the difference between getting by and going hungry. But they also had another use. The cigarettes, the chocolates, the soap and all that stuff could all be used for bribing a goon. [male #1] 'Report to the recreation field immediately.' 'Report to the recreation field immediately.' [dog barking] [indistinct chatter] [speaking in foreign language] 'And the firearms.' I wonder what they're up to. Target practice by the look of it. You will listen! Yup! [indistinct chatter] 'The German Government has always been mindful' 'of the duty it owes it's prisoners.' 'But the German Government was shocked to note' that after the recent abortive enemy raid 'on the seaport of JIP' many German soldiers were found 'shot in the back.' 'Their hands having been tied behind them.' Therefore, the German Government 'has no alternative' 'but to show it's horror' 'at this barbaric treatment of its soldiers' 'by making examples of the terror gangsters' 'who perpetrate the uncivilized crimes.' God almighty.. They're gonna shoot us. In the future, you will have your hands tied from nine in the morning until nine at night! [laughing] Alright, you English pigs. Tie them up and see how funny they find it. You know, I think I know a way to make these blokes sorry they ever started this. [chuckles] It's good, eh? [laughs] Go to the latrines. Tell the others. To the latrines, tell the others. To the latrines, tell the others. Oh, God. Thanks. Right. Break free into lines, join the queue. [indistinct chattering] [speaking in foreign language] - Hey, Bill.. - What? You see what I see? Why it must be 1000 more to do. Oh, 1500 at least. Fifteen, eh? - Yeah, easy. - Oh, I suppose you're right. We'll be here all night then, won't we? Ouch! This is my third time, you know. I wonder how long they'll pull this stuff remembering faces. They're looking at our wrists and our marks. [dog barking] [whistling] Gonna get dark soon. Yeah, we'll have to bring the candles out. I haven't got any candles. - There's some back there. - No, used them all up. - Every one of 'em. - Eh, um.. Have, uh, haven't.. No, no, no. It's alright, it's alright. - You get on. - Okay. [male narrator] And so, round and around we went. That's one little game the Jerries didn't try again. ♪ I wonder why ♪ ♪ You keep me waiting ♪ ♪ Charmaine my Charmaine ♪ ♪ I wonder ♪ ♪ When bluebirds are mating ♪ ♪ Will you come back again ♪ ♪ I wonder ♪ ♪ If I keep on praying ♪ ♪ Will all our dreams come true ♪ ♪ I wonder if you ♪ ♪ Ever think of me too ♪ ♪ I'm waiting ♪ ♪ I'm sorry ♪ ♪ All is.. ♪♪ [all shouting] [all cheering] Quiet! Quiet! The goons moved off! [indistinct chatter] Let us all know why you're here. To start a new tunnel. Is there really any use in trying again? - 'Yes!' - 'Yes!' It's them blasted sunken Mikes that have done us in. Sure! The Jerries can pickup the sight of our shovels fifteen even, twenty feet away! But not 25! That's how deep we'll have to make it! [all shouting] The tunnel will start in hut 110. That's a bloody long way from the outside. Two hundred and eighty feet to the trees be on the wire. [all shouting] Quiet, quiet, quiet! [indistinct chattering] It will take four to five hundred men to pull it off. We'll need diggers, stooges, undercover workers. How many will be in on the escape? A 100, maybe? [all shouting] Look, look! Look, you all know what the kraut said. They'll take it out on any of us left in the compound. So a hundred blokes! A hundred get their backsides outta here and the rest of us take the rap. - Yeah! Yeah! - Yeah! With our bloody hands tied behind our backs from nine to nine. Look, if you gentlemen have forgotten you're supposed to be fighting this war. Not sitting on your backsides waiting for it to finish! Well, a fat load of fighting you'll be doing with a bullet in your back. And that's likely to happen to any bloke that goes through that tunnel! Ah, they won't shoot you. It's against the rules. [all shouting] Rules my eye! It won't worry Jerry any! I'm stayin'! [all shouting] [indistinct chattering] Just because there's no top brass around here to give orders it doesn't change a damn thing! We are soldiers! We've gotta make every effort we can to escape! That's our duty! [all] 'Yeah!' [all shouting] Quiet, quiet, quiet! Quiet! He's looking this way. Hold it, hold it, listen. This tunnel's gonna go through. It's gonna be difficult, dangerous and damn hard work! Yeah, and damn foolish! Now, look, alright. Suppose we do get out. We get caught anyway. Of course some of us will get caught, but some of us get away! And we'll be pulling Jerries away from the fighting to look for us. - 'Yeah!' - He's heading this way! Quiet! What do you know? That is worth the risk! Just to get outta this stinking joint! [all] Yeah! As soon as he's gone, we'll assign the jobs. Starting with the undercover workers. Come on, men. Hurry up, Hurry up. [instrumental music] [indistinct singing] [singing continues] [all shouting] Oh! [singing continues] [cheering] [instrumental music] A factory of undercover workers. And all under an umbrella of lassitude. Of bored, frustrated idle prisoners. Miserably waiting for the war to end. They converted all uniforms blankets, scrap material anything they could lay their hands on into civilian clothes. The forgers laboriously copied passports travel papers, work permits. They duplicated the cloth covers. Even the official seals. Bits and pieces of information gleaned from every possible source.. ...were pooled in the making of maps. Resourceful carpenters fashioned the digging tools and pinched the wood to shore up the tunnel. But perhaps the most important of all were the engineers. The blokes who designed the tunnel itself. A goon. The workers were protected by an interlocking system of stooges. All materials could be concealed on a moment's warning. Dry runs got it down to a, well, a split second basis. Twenty five feet below the surface was a small room at the mouth of the tunnel. Okay, Charlie. Air for the diggers was supplied by a very ingenious pump. The bellows were made from kit bags ribbed with wire. The pipes which sent the air through the tunnel were put together from tin cans joined end-to-end. Go and have a shower. I'll take over. Up you go. Mind how you go, boys. Carefully. [wood creaking] Right! Get moving. Just empty that sack. Don't bring up anymore, boys. - It's getting late. - Alright. Quick, Frank, thread. [wood creaking] - Get me out of here. - Now, wait a min, wait.. Get me out of here! Let me out of here. Pringle, hold it. [yelling] I gotta get out. Keep still. [clamoring] [male #2] 'For God's sake, stop it. 'you'll bring the whole thing down on us.' - Joey, watch it. - I couldn't help it. Don't worry.. Now just stay calm and I'll get you out. [wood creaking] - Come on. - No, no. I wake up and I can't sweat it. The same bleedin' dream over and over. [wood creaking] Take it easy. It's like a vice clamped! Like a bloody coffin! [wood creaking] [tunnel collapsing] Are you alright? It's a cave in! 'Get out!" I can't move! I'm trapped in the sand pouring on top of me. [choking and coughing] Come on, man. Come on, come on. I can't move. I can't move. [indistinct mumbling] Don't come down! It's a cave in. What's happening there now? [grunting] Come on. [wood creaking] [grunting] Now be gone. Get out yourself. [wood creaking] Hold on. Now, pull! Come on, pull! [grunting] Now, give me your other arm. Give me your other arm. - Got it? - Yup! [grunting] It's caving. [grunting] [clamoring] - What's going on? - What happened down there? - Come on. - Anybody hurt there? - What happened? - Ah, it's all my fault. - Your fault? - Bloody hell. [clamoring] He's got claustrophobia. It takes more...guts for him to go down there than any of us. Tell you what? Take him down to the shower. How the hell are we gonna get rid of all this? Ah, I don't know. We missed flipping sand behind the walls in the eaves, under the buildings spread it on the field. Damn, we've even shoved it down the latrines. In fact there's only one place we ain't stuffed it yet. And I might try that next time I see old Schmidt. [male #3] 'Go on, hit.' I'll catch that. - Over here with the ball. - Alright, come on. [indistinct chatter] - 'Let's go.' - 'Over here, sit over here.' Hey! - That's it. - Alright, come on. - 'Over here.' - 'Over here, quick.' [footsteps] [indistinct chatter] Just had a signal from Hut 1-12. a goon's on the prowl. - Heading this way? - Could be, not sure yet. - Let's get cracking. - Hurry up. There's a goon on the prowl. Quick. It is a goon. And he's headed straight for here. - Get Coward. - Grab that. The goon's coming, quick! Oh, alright, let's go. Get inside. Well, he's not inside, but we can't take a chance. Put the stove back. Move everything. - What about the sand? - Put it all back in the hole. - Go on, hurry up. - Okay. What we gonna do now? [indistinct chatter] We gotta hurry! [intense music] Oh, captain, I was hoping I might see you. Uh, sergeant major, about your request regarding more fuel for the stove.. Yeah, it was getting pretty nippy in the hut in the evenings, with all this snow and everything. I thought the men might get ill. I will see for myself what it's like in your hut. But it is war and we give all that is possible. I'm afraid sergeant major, your men will have to lunge, jump, work, and keep warm so. Yeah. It's Schmidt. He's getting closer. [indistinct chatter] Frivolous claims we cannot make up on our great people. [male #4] 'Don't break away yet.' [indistinct chatter] They suffer too for victory. Your discomfort, just little, just nothing. Compared with the destruction of Britain with the new fuhrer but.. Boom! Understand? - You mean it's very accurate. - Yeah, accurate. We would like to know and we will find out. [indistinct chatter] By orders all the army officers must be questioned. They say new invention. New nothing. [intense music] Well, as a matter of fact, as a matter of fact.. ...there...there is a new device but.. ...oh, well, ten to one it's not the one you're thinkin' of. So? Well, when I was working at de Havilland's just before the war they were experimenting then on a.. ...uh, on a secret bomb site. This is very interesting. - Is it true sergeant major? - Yes, yes. Quite true it is. Quite true, but.. [dramatic music] ...working on Fuhrer'ssecret. Come on! Of course. [intense music] Morning, sir. Morning, sir. [male #5] 'Morning, captain.' You say, it is cold in here, sergeant major? It is hot. Too hot! 'Look at the men.' 'They're sweating.' All of them are sweating. Sweating because of the heat. [scoffing] More fuel. No time for such nonsense. - Oh,sir! - Oh,sir! [instrumental music] That's a real beaut. I don't think even ol' Himmler could tell which is which.. ...if it had a photo.. Yeah, it it had a photo. Ooh-oh, look who's coming.. ...headed in this direction too. He couldn't have seen the permit. Not from that distance. We shall soon find out. [whistling] HerrBoliden wants to see you. Come. I don't like the sound of that. Neither do I. But if we can bribe a goon into giving us a permit why not a camera? Boys have already pulled their cigarettes chocolates, soap. We've got a goon on the hook we've just haven't got any bait. We can't wait for Red Cross passes. We gotta bribe those goons with something. Well, you wish me luck, I'm on my way. Oh, sergeant major this is HauptmannNicki who wishes to talk with you. I shall like a few words with you. HerrBoliden,I don't think we need to detain you. Thank you. Now, do sit down, Mr. Coward. Thank you. Tell me. Are you fairly comfortable in camp? Well, it's a bit neighborly, yeah. I miss the pubs but.. ...otherwise its alright. Lamsdorf is a far cry from London, I'm afraid. But still...we can be generous, Mr. Coward. As you'll find.. ...the more intelligent of us have great respect for the British. A lovely country thought that is. I toured in London for a couple of years. Did you live there? No. Not in London. Just outside. Near that de Havilland Works? Not far away. Can you forget for a moment that I am a German? Frankly, I find that a bit of a job. I'll have a go. Why? I bet you know, don't you? What was your job at the factory? Oh, I had all sorts of jobs. Dummies, sometimes. Prototypes? Things like the experimental bombsite? No, not exactly. But you heard about it? Oh, yes. I heard about it alright. 'From whom?' Well, friends like, you know.. Did they show you anything? Show me anything? This was top secret. Will you be sensible and cooperate? Well, I'll try. Cast your mind back and recall anything. Anything at all about it that you can? Um, well, I'm not very good at, um.. I'm not very good at describing things. But you could sketch the idea? No, I can't draw a straight line. I can just manage noughts and crosses. But you could try. We can piece it together. Let's start right away. Now, this is a hell of a thing you're asking me to do you realize that, don't you? Now, what's in it for me? What do you want? First of all, I want your personal word that none of this reaches the ears of British Government, alright? And.. And? Double rations for all the men. Double rations? Well alright, then.. ...cigarettes, soap, chocolate I'll settle for that. This too is a difficult request. But perhaps it can be arranged. That's all. [door closes] [Charles] Milk chocolate. Marvelous. Do you want a piece? Ah! Don't be so greedy. You have a little bit, there you are. - What is this? Swiss? - Bavarian. - From the Bavarian Alps. - It's delicious. Still, there's nothing like a good cigarette. [exhales] Aye. And there's this freshly brewed coffee - Aye. Uh-uh. - Look, here. [whistling] Here. Bastello, pay attention. All this can be yours. The lot. A camera? - No, no-- - No, no, no. We don't want just a camera. I want film, developer, printing paper-- No, no, it's-it's too dangerous. You mean, it's more dangerous than you lending me your work permit. Ah, but this is different. If they search me I am supposed to have a work permit. Oh, yes, I know you are. You were supposed to. So you're going to give it back? Well, I don't know. That all rather depends, doesn't it? [sighs] I'm.. But a camera! No, I can't do it! Y-you're asking too much. Alright, well, I'm afraid we shall have to go to the camp commandant. It's a pity. Yes. You've been trading with prisoners. And we've got three witnesses, haven't we? Hm. Now, all of you.. ...you'll be sent to the guard house. You'll be sent to the Russian Front. Unless, he's very unlucky and get sent to a firing squad instead. - Yeah. - Would they do that to him? - Of course. - Of course, they would. Alright, alright, I'll-I'll see what I can do. Oh, but...my permit. - Oh, your permit. - Yeah, yes. Yes, on delivery. On delivery. Here, anyway. Take these two on accounts, see. Put 'em in your pocket. Take 'em home to Broomhilda. Now, off you go. There's a good boy. - What time is it? - Eh? - What time is it? - Eh...twenty past. I've got very important meeting with some gentleman from the Luftwaffe. In a few moments, as a matter of fact. You don't mean you're gonna show them that lunatic plan of yours? Well, it is not a lunatic plan. J. Walsh gave me a hand with it. He actually worked on the bombsite? Oh, no, he-he-he didn't work on it. But...well, he's an engineer, you know. He can make it a bit more closable. Now, look here, Charlie, it's one thing fooling Schmidt and Necke, I mean.. ...well, they don't get the brainy boys to run a POW camp. Besides they are not technicians. - But the Luftwaffe-- - I know, I know. But it's just a matter of, well, spinning this thing as long as we can, that's all. They might send you right into a bloody concentration camp. You know, I had thought of that now as a possibility. Little late, isn't it? Anyway, can you two blokes think of any better way of getting the loot to bribe the goons with? No. So this has gotta do the job for us. [Charles] Now, like every, uh, every brilliant invention this is really very simple. A-a vent, a vent leads from the nose of the aircraft Type this down to this kind of a vein. And then the air comes in down here and turns it around like so, you see. Well, at the start of every bombing sortie.. ...this master pointer here is set to any of the targets you see on this star like Essen.. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Frankfurt, you know? - Yeah. - Well, this then in turn-- [speaking in foreign language] [male on speaker] 'Report to the recreation field immediately.' 'Report to the recreation field immediately.' - Oh, now what's happened? - They've discovered the tunnel. - Oh, blimey-- - The old one, not ours. [speaking in foreign language] [indistinct chatter] [shouting in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] This will not do! You're children, to imagine you can outwit the resources of the German army! 'Even if you do manage to crawl through your ridiculous tunnels' 'you cannot possibly get back to Britain.' 'It is too far!' But we've already taken the boards from your tunnel.. '...and trucks, heavy trucks..' ...will run backwards and forwards over the top.. ...until it is all.. ...caved in! [laughing] [siren blaring] Like, wow, how was that cave in? [siren blaring] Now, what's on? [siren blaring] [engine revving] Now what are they up to? The big brass has been here before but nothing like this. [male on speaker] 'Attention, please.' 'Attention, please.' 'Sergeant Major Coward.' 'Sergeant Major Coward.' 'You're wanted by the commandant.' [sighs] Perhaps they want you to have tea with Hitler. Well, if they do, I'll get you an invitation too. Tell him I'll only take three lumps of sugar though. [knocking] [male #6] 'Come on in.' Well, sit down. [speaking in foreign language] Sergeant major, here, please. Coward, well, I'm not entirely satisfied with your story. Oh, really, sir. I don't understand, that I'm sure. Don't you? I suggest that this.. ...this contraption of yours is complete fabrication from the beginning to end. Oh, I don't know what you mean sir. Do you take us for idiots, sergeant major? Well, of course not, sir, not-- Don't interrupt, these gentlemen here left important work mainly to find that your so called bombsite is absolute nonsense! Are you calling me a liar, sir? Don't you start-- Look, I'm only asking you if you're calling me a liar. First of all, you force a.. You force a prisoner of war to commit an act of treason. - A force? - Yes, force. Ugh! [speaking in foreign language] According to the terms of the Geneva convention.. Silence! Men. [indistinct chatter] Quiet! A toast to the sergeant major's return to our fold. [cheering] They give him 90 days, he's out in ten. - That's so jolly. - 'So jolly.' The commandant and I, the commandant and I are like that at the moment. [cheering] Alright, alright, we made a little deal together. Deal? What kind of a deal? Oh, well, I-I agreed to, uh, head a work detail. At a ruddy lumber mill no less. That's why you were let out of solitary? Yeah, it wasn't for his health. Ah, they made it too easy for him. Them Jerries are up to something, if you ask me. Yes, uh, where are they sending you? Poland. Where in Poland? I don't know, Breslau, why? Nothing. Oh, well, I'm going with him. - 'You what?' - I volunteered. Well, somebody's gotta keep eye on him.

Yeah, well, I thought of that myself. You see, we need more things for the escape. More detailed maps, latest time-tables. Yeah, well, I got a list of all those things. You see, I worked it out that a prisoner of war would be a bit more free in a prison camp like that rather than this sort of a place. Hmm. Considerably more. Under some conditions that allow a POW into town. - With a guard. - Yeah. Even without one. Really? You see, um, we have a possible contact in Breslau. With a Polish underground. - In Breslau? - Mm. Blimey, that's a coincidence. That could mean something. That could mean a bullet in the head for you. Now, you get this straight. When you're fooling with the underground you're no longer considered a POW. - But a spy. - Yeah. Wait, do you, ah, do you know who the contact is? Well, the person's connected in someway with, um, optometry. - With what? - Ah. Well, you know glasses. Oh, yeah, yeah, I know. And the password is "cleaning cloths". - Mm, cleaning cloths? - That's all we know. It's not much to go on, is it? - Dangerously little. - Hmm. It could be a trap.

Please. After you, Mr. Coward. The sergeant major last one, was very good man. He get men work very hard. I like. I make sergeant major nice spirit. We friends too, eh? Well, that depends. Yeah, sergeant major. How do you like? You mean, you're gonna give me a room to my self? Yeah, yeah. Undspecial rations. You eat with us. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But where do the men sleep? They sleep over there. They are lazy. They need good sergeant major who works them. [instrumental music] Hello, mates. I understand you got a spare bunk here. Alright, I'll have this one. Well, that's if you don't mind. - Hey, look, mates, if it's-- - Alright! What the.. [music continues] Hello, chaps. This is a funny kind of a welcome. Who the hell do you think I am? Bloody Hitler? Look.. What's it all about? I'm Sergeant Major Coward. Would you mind explaining what the trouble is? Look, for the last time, what's the trouble? Alright. I'll take you all on. One at a time. And that goes for you too, jacker. - Drop that! - Hey. Hey. 'Hey.' [music resumes] We know why you're here. Plan to work the flamin' guts out of us. Live like a Lord yourself. Get everything you want from that fat slag of an underofficer. The bloke ahead of you tried it. This shredded his kisser like ground meat. And who's next? The Jerries told us all about you. How you got their blasted interest at heart. 'And that you're worse than the other bloke' 'ever thought of bein'.' Hey, you see, I told you they was up to something. They made it too easy. Yeah, they wanted these blokes to do me in and save them the bother. Yeah, and do you know why? Because he's been giving 'em too much trouble. And I'm goin' on givin' 'em too much trouble too and you're gonna help me. A great new chapter starts from tomorrow. My first problem was to get to town without a guard. Without a guard.. Without a guard. Gradually an idea began forming in my mind. I noticed, that with Germanic precision the underofficer in charge of the lumber camp lit his pipe everyday at the same time.. Get out! ...and at the same place. Funny how many fights there were among the POW's. Blokes made it look pretty real, too. [indistinct chatter] And they did divert attention. Soon, we'd got more petrol stashed away than a whole refinery. There was petrol in the fire buckets in the extinguishers even in the emergency water turbine. And all for a purpose. We waited for the first hot day. Everything was rigged. Waiting for a match. A match carelessly tossed. [flames burst] [yelling] Water! Water! Get buckets! Right now! Buckets, right now! Come on! [indistinct yelling] [bell ringing] [indistinct yelling] What are you doing? We're trying to choke the fire. Use dirt not wood! - Dirt? - Dirt! Oh, you mean this stuff? - Oh. - Oh, alright. - Get the hose! - 'It's right here!' [soldier #1] 'It's right here! It's right here!' Not the blankets. Water! - Alright. - Water! [flames bursting] [indistinct yelling] [indistinct chatter] 'Fire!' Clear! Clear! Connect the hose! Let go! Let go! [yells] [laughing] Find some water! Connect the hose! [yelling] Turn on the water! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! [indistinct yelling] Sorry, guvnor. [fire crackling] [man yelling] [clamoring] Get some sand! Get some.. - Tractor. Tractor. - I can't drive a tractor. Drive the tractor! I've never driven one in my life before. Drive it! Oh. [engine sputtering] [engine whirring] [explosion] [rattling] [explosion] [rumbling] [indistinct yelling] [fire crackling] [rumbling] [sighs] Cheer up. Not much longer. [indistinct clamoring] Aah! [explosion] Excuse me, sir, can I have a word with you? Well, I just, umm.. ...I just hope you don't think that, uh we had anything to do with this very nasty business here behind us. I mean, everybody saw you strike that match in wood part, you know. - It was accident. - Oh, come on. The sun in the wood so hot, combustion. Now, look, you know very well it wasn't an accident and you know it wasn't combustion. Now, don't you? Well, then. But we think you're a very nice old bloke and I'm gonna have a talk to the other men and see if they'll, uh, well, keep quiet about it. Yeah, but I want a favor from you in return. Oh, what? Well, I'm not getting enough freedom at the moment, if you know what I mean. And I would like to go into town without a guard. - No escapes. - No what? No, no, no, no escapes, no escapes. I'll give you my word of honor on that. And a British officer never, never changes his word of honor. As an officer of the glorious Third Reich I accept the solemn word of honor of a British soldier. Oh, that's very nice of you. Thank you. But you don't try to escape. No, no, I won't escape. Rest assured, I won't escape. Hey, Charlie. What happened, did you get it? - Yeah. - Well, without a guard? Well, you know he's in a spot. I said I'll speak to the blokes and ask them to keep quiet about it. Well, you don't trust him, do you? Well, of course, what else could he do? He can have you shot in the back. Oh, don't talk rubbish. You get caught in town without a guard he will get you for trying to escape. He will, and no messin'. Straight out. Yeah, straight out, well, you bloody well know. [instrumental music] [speaking in foreign language] Umm.. Uh, glasses. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Uh, "O-W-P-T-L-Z-B "D-G-H-R-O-C-S-E F-E-P-A-K." [speaking in foreign language] Hmm? [speaking in foreign language] "O-W-P-T-L-Z-B-D "G-H-R-O-C-S-E E-P-F-A-K." There's nothing wrong with your eyes, sergeant major. They're perfect. It's your memory that's bad. Well, I don't really understand that. You'd forgotten on the first run through it was not the F and P that caused you difficulty but the E and F. There's not much wrong with your memory, is there? Or your English. - Why did you come here? - Ahem. Umm...would you like a cigarette? Yes, please. Uh, what-what's your name? Irena will do. Mine's, uh, Coward, Charlie Coward. - Something wrong? - No, no. I was just surprised to see a woman optician, that's all. And why not? No reason. How very fortunate for you, Mr. Coward that they should allow a prisoner of war into town without a guard. Well, you know about the honor system, don't you? For special prisoners, of course. Of course. - Very special. - Oh, I know what it is. You think I'm one of those Jerry's stooges, don't you? From up of the lumber mill. [bell dinging] It's none of my concern, Mr. Coward. Please excuse me. [speaking in foreign language] Well, Mr. Coward. I wanted to know if you could help me to get some materials. Materials? Cleaning cloths? That's a very strange request. Could you help? Such luxuries are hard to come by. I'm afraid there's nothing I can do for you. Well, there's just one other thing now.. Good day, Mr. Coward. Do you know if there's other opticians in the town? Yes, there is one other. But if you don't wear glasses, why do you want cleaning cloths? Would you mind giving me the address please? I'll do better than that. I'll take you there. Uh, it's not necessary, really, it's very kind of you but it's not-not a bit necessary. But it might be difficult for you to find it by yourself. Where'd you learn your English? Umm, I'm sorry I forgot something. I'll be right back. [dramatic music] [music continues] I had promised to phone a customer. Oh! What about your English? I've been for about one year in London. Oh, what were you doing? Refraction work. At a clinic. Oh, where? You're very inquisitive, Mr. Coward. Well, you don't mind tellin' me surely. Well, at an eye hospital. Uh, which one? The one in Kensington? That's right. Oh, I know. It's in Marlowe's Road, isn't it? Yes. You know, I don't know whether to chance it and make a run for it and get a bullet in my back or tag along with you to the Gestapo. I'm a Gestapo agent? Yeah, and a very stupid one? You've fallen for a very old trick. I've described to you perfectly the location of a hospital St. Mary's Hospital. How interesting. And the eye hospital is in Soho, not in Kensington. Not the one I refer to, Mr. Coward. I refer to Moorefield Eye Hospital that's on City Road. And for your information, sergeant major you described the location of St. Mary Abbot's Hospital. However, eh, an understandable confusion. St. Mary's is in Paddington, opposite the station. Yeah, well. Maybe you're right. It's in Praed Street. Uh, shall I describe the building? No, no, thank you. Uh, no, I know it very well, thanks. As you said, Mr. Coward, it's a very old trick. But it works two ways. Well, it's like a broken coin, isn't it? I mean the two pieces fit together. Not entirely. The shop is over there. And, uh, again, Mr. Coward, good day. Incidentally, you'll find that optometrist a loyal Nazi. Oh, Irena.. Irena. Alright.. ...I haven't got very much time to play around any longer. Are you with the underground? May I offer you some advice, sergeant major? It's still dangerous for prisoner of war to linger in town for too long. You shouldn't overdo your privileges. I've been overdoing them already. Every visit to town counts. Exactly. What do you need, Mr. Coward? Look.. ...everything that's on that list. Maps, time-tables. [speaking in foreign language] He looks a bit angry, don't he? [speaking in foreign language] [whistling] [whistling] Come here! This man is a prisoner of war. How dare he go to town without a guard? 'How dare he come here sauntering' 'like it was his own private club?' 'What is the meaning of this?' [Charlie] 'I-Ijust had some personal business, there in town.' So, HerrUnderofficer accommodated you? Don't be too hard on him, he's only trying to be a good scout. - A good scout? - It was perfectly alright. He had my word. I gave him my word of honor. [speaking in foreign language] 'Now, just what about this fire?' 'Things always happen when you're around.' 'What do you know about it?' 'How did it start?' [Schmidt] 'It was the heat combustion.' [male #7] 'I'm asking you again, Mr. Coward.' - What happened? - I saw it start. A pile of logs, they just went poof! [male #7] 'Exactly, what happened?' It burned down. [male narrator] Our next assignment was in the railroad repair yards. The buildings were of brick and steel and completely fire-proof. However, to show their good intentions POWs went about their work with a soul stirring display of willingness and boundless energy. The Jerries were delighted. Of course, there were one or two things they didn't know about. A carload of green paint consigned to a concentration camp would suddenly be shunted to the Russian front. While a carload of canned meat intended for the front would go to the concentration camp. [train whistling] Propellers for a submarine base would head for the farmlands. And ploughs to the submarine base. Watch it. Okay. [metal clanking] [speaking in foreign language] I'm cutting these bolts on the, uh, the guard.. the iron guard. Good, good. For this sabotage, you'll be shot. All of you. Several times. The visor was made of cardboard polished with boot black. Insignia carved from wood and covered with tinfoil. The coat was cut from a blanket with the fuzz shaved off and blackberry jam from the Red Cross parcels boiled down and the strainings used as dye. The boots cost a tin of cigarettes and two, uh, cakes of soap. All carefully hidden between the walls.. ...until.. [train whistling] ...until the first delivery of our repaired cars. What's the German for "over there"? Dort druben. [hissing] [indistinct clamoring] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] - HeilHitler. - HeilHitler. [speaking in foreign language] He may have suspected something. - I'm not sure. - I know. And the German uniform, where did you get it? The blokes up at the camp made it for me. It doesn't fit anyway, but it just had to do. Huh, did you have to take such a terrible risk? Well, believe me, it was the only way to get here. I get the papers. [speaking in foreign language] [Irena] 'You didn't give us much time.' We're being moved out. What happened? It's too involved to tell you. But if I'm right, we'll be shipped back to Lamsdorf tomorrow. We did the best we could. Uh, it's marvelous. There's maps and time-tables. Everything we need. Thank you. [speaking in foreign language] Did you set the date, I mean for the escape? We're aiming for the 26th, that's the night with no full moon. How will you get to the border? By the dawn train from Lamsdorf the next morning. But if you don't speak German, you don't have any chance. I'm sure. [dramatic music] [screaming] [banging on door] [Irena shouting indistinctly] [speaking in foreign language] Stop, where do you think you're going? - To powder me nose. - Alright. [speaking in foreign language] [shouting in foreign language] - HeilHitler! - Heil.. Heil. Where have you been? Where do you think I've been? Come on, get cracking.. Ah, good, good. Why do I have to do all the work around here? Yeah, blimey, you're fit. What's the matter with you, you've got a splinter? [chuckling] [whistling] Cole. Here, Cole. Do you know what I just heard in there? Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Take your hands out of your pocket. Do your collar up. Where do you think you are, on your father's yatch? What do you want? I was just gonna tell a bit of news, that's all. What news? Charlie Coward's on his way back. Charlie Coward's on his way back? Where'd you get this? I was just sweeping up in office there. It came over the telephone. That's a turn out for the book, innit.. ...sir? I wonder if he got the maps and time-tables. Oh, even if he did how's he gonna get them past the inspection. Charlie, we're nearly there. Yes, I know we are. Hang on, I'll think of something. I always get my best ideas just before the dawn. Yeah, well, don't look now, mate, but it's daylight. I'll said I'll think of something. Hey...where are they? - What? - The papers, where are they? - They're in my kit? - In your kit? Well, in me kit, in me clothes, what's the difference? They'll search everything, kit, clothes down the skin before they're finished. Hey, I know what's wrong with you. You're still worried about that girl, aren't you? Of course I am. I left her in a terrible hell. I shouldn't have done it. From the look of things, it might bloody well all be for nothing. Good plans of cheering me up for God's sake. [mumbling] I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll pull the old switcheroo gag. What do you mean? A bloody thing-- You have another fit, you have a fit. You do it marvelous. - Yeah, I know. - Well, alright. If they find these papers on me they'll know they came from the underground. Where else could I have got them from? Well, they still have to trace it back to her. I shouldn't have done it to her. - I really shouldn't have. - Anybody.. Hey, man, it's alright, I shouldn't have done it. [speaking in foreign language] Now remember, you keep ahead. Open your kitbags. [groaning] He's having a fit. Lift him now, come on, get him off the floor. He's often like this. It's the food. You-you alright? You alright? You've got his kit? Oh, have I? [speaking in foreign language] [groaning] I'm sorry, sir. I fainted. I'll be alright, now. [speaking in foreign language] - What now? - You do whatever I do. Hurry up! - Start scratching. - Scratching? Scratching. It's you again. [Schmidt] 'First of all you try to make idiots of us.' With your ridiculous.. - What's the matter with you? - Huh, lice. And, I warn you, if you think you could go on.. Lice? Oh, terrible. Oh, I got it. But there's hundreds more. There it is. [Charlie] 'Don't move.' Missed. Get out of here! - Both of you! - Oh, ta.. [male narrator] On the 22nd, the escape committee swung into action. A strange electrifying tension crept through the compound. It was nearing that crucial day. The day set for the tunnel break. November 26th. Shilling's walkin' East, between 118 and 119 headed for the generator house. By the 23rd, the stooges had been quadrupled. And a vast system installed for checking the moments of the goons. The undercover faction was put on all out basis. Work permits, travel papers everything had to be stamped the 26th. Please, help me with this. - Yes, stick it on the chair. - Alright. Oh, oh, don't just stand there, grab a pen, mate. We haven't got much time left. [male narrator] On the 24th.. ...a group leader was assigned to every 12 men. I was one of them. Anybody else here only speaks, uh, English? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Blimey, Pringle, it would be you. Come, stand to attention. Stand up when you're talkin' to me. Well, you go off with Robinson then he'll do the talking for both of you. Now, you'll need maps, time-tables, money travel permits, that'll be fixed arranged, uh you know, we'll work out the details later. - So, I'll see you guys. - Yes, sir. Who's next? Jim Osborne, sir. I intend to get to the Czech border on foot. Yeah, well, you only need maps and a compass. You speak any other language? No, sir. Aren't you the bloke that, uh was against this idea in the theater that time? Yes, sir, that's right. And what's given you a change of heart? Thought of a nice little lager, did you? No, sir, I was, uh.. ...I've been thinking about what you said. You know, about being a soldier and duty and all that. All I know is he's done a lot of work on it. - He's our chief engineer. - That's my game, isn't it ? That's what he used to do in City Street. Dig tunnels. Alright, alright, we don't want your life history. - Yes, sir. - You'll take a chance with him? Yes. Alright, you're on. - Thank you very much, sir. - Now, what's your story? Well, I thought if I'm, started to move down.. [male narrator] On the 25th.. ...each group leader held a final dress rehearsal. [whistling] - What's you name? - Jacques Vivien. - Where you employed? - Zam Industries, Hamburg, 8-3-5-9 Burg Strauss. Here's my permit and letter from the company. - When did you start there? - July 16, 1942. And where'd you come from? Uh, uh, Leon, number 77 General Policze My wife's name is Evon with three children. - What's your name? - Otter Minnce. Here, Charlie. It's the schedule for tomorrow night. Cole thought you might wanna brief the men on it. Yeah, thanks. This is the schedule. Every 30 seconds, starting at 7:00 p.m. a man will be dispatched to hut 110. By 20:30 all 180 should be there ready to go. Each one of you'll be given the precise second at which you ought to leave your hut. The precise route and the precise moment of your arrival. Well, what about the chaps that bunk in 110? I mean the one's that aren't going? Well, they'll change over with the ones that are going. - Alright? - Yeah. Fine. Now, that's the end of the first dummy run. Now, remember, on that night behave as if it was all perfectly normal. You've gotta be absolutely natural. [dramatic music] Fifteen seconds left. Good luck. See you at Piccadilly Circus. See you. [music continues] That's it, Pringle. Now, let see, 18 men leave from the other huts. You'll be the next to go from here, Martin.. - ...in nine minutes. - Alright. - Alright. - Scheele, you're up. - Pringle? - Yes, sir. - Alright. - Good luck, Pringle. I won't let you down this time, Charlie. - Sir. - I promise I won't. I know you won't. Let's get you out of there. Well, that's it. We've checked every bloody inch of the whole bloody length of that tunnel. We're not guaranteeing anything. - Blankets laid? - Carpeted wall to wall, sir. - Good. - My name is Paul Vandrom. I'm from Amsterdam. I'm an attorney. How's your German? [speaking in foreign language] I hope it's alright, for your for sake you know what it means. - From your wife? - Yeah. You know, you'll see her again, I'm sure of that. You alright? - Yeah. - Hmm. Just wanna get going, that's all. Yeah, we all do. You'll be going soon enough. - You alright? - It's the waitin' that gets ya. Yeah, I know, doesn't it? You'll be off. Half a mile across from here. They've almost completed their rounds. Good. That's half mile the other way. He's out at the guardroom. Right on schedule. [dramatic music] Where's Krausman?. He's also entered the guardroom. There are no more goons patrolling the huts. Good. I'm on my way. Be safe, huh? Thanks. Higgy Spring, sir. Great, alright. - 20:30 hours. - Yeah, I know. Well, they've all arrived. This is the last man. - Connelly? - Yes, sir. Alright. Well, now, pay attention. As you know, Charlie Coward goes first. He'll make the breakthrough at the other end. We've left two feet of earth to the surface. Now, if everything goes according to plan he'll come out in the pine grove. Just a couple of points before we start. It's gonna be very tricky going through this tunnel with all your gear. So whatever you do, don't whack the shoring. 'Don't even brush up against it.' 'Otherwise, we shall have a disaster with the whole lot' 'collapsing in on top of us.' Second point is, those going by rail, will leave first. They've got very tight time schedules to fill. The first 20 men will wait in the tunnel.. ...until I've broken through. 'We aim to get one man out every four minutes.' 'The rest of you will wait here..' '...in this hut..' '...until your names are called.' After all that...this is it. So, good journeys, keep moving.. ...and good luck to you. - Good luck to you. - Good luck to you. - Good luck. - Good luck, mate. - Okay, fine. Pope. - Here. Ciao,mate. Me last will and testament. Alright, cheers. Good luck. - Bennett. - Here. - See ya, Bennett. - Good luck, Bunny. All the best, Ben. ♪ You take the higher road and I'll take the lower one ♪ - Campbell. - Sir. ♪ For me and my true love will never meet again ♪ ♪ On the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond ♪ - Boyle. - Sir. - Alright, good luck, yeah. - Good luck. - Davis. - Sir. [grunting] Okay, Mace. You make the 20th and it for the moment. Yes, sir. Alright, Charlie? No, I've st.. ...struck a...a root. I'm trying to move it. [creaking] [coughing] [panting] Charlie, the-the air down here, it's getting bad. Well, don't waste it talking then. I never said a word. [coughing] Krausman's suddenly left the guardroom. - He's starting back this way. - Krausman left the guardroom. - He's starting back this way. - Krausman left the guardroom. He's hardly ever bothered about us after lock up. Krausman left the guardroom. Of all nights for this to happen. Just because he's left the guardroom it doesn't mean to say he's gonna come in this hut. Then what's he doing? What's he up to? Charlie, I-I'll come on, give you a hand. No, stay where you are. You can see there's only room for one up here. [coughing] Krausman still headed this way. What'll we do? Just wait here like sitting ducks? [male #8] 'What else, there's no way to cover up.' Not a 180 blokes in all this rig. Look, maybe we can just make it if we chuck all these clothes and gear down the shaft. You want the 20 men in the tunnel to suffocate? And that's what would happen if we put the stove back over the hole. Well, why don't we jump the goon the minute he comes in? And how long do you think we'll get away with that? They check on the goons every few minutes. Quiet. All of you. [coughing] Charlie, this air is getting very bad. H-how much longer? [panting] I don't know. You better warn Cole. You got a pencil, Bennett? - Y-yeah? - Yeah. Here you are. [coughing] There, quick, Bennett, pass that back. Pass the note back. Coward's having trouble. Pass it back. Coward's having trouble. - Pass it back. - Pass it back. - Pass it back. - Coward's having trouble. - Pass it back. - Coward's having trouble. [dog barking in the distance] Looks very bad, boys. Krausman seems to be heading straight for this hut. They must be suspicious. So many men coming in and out of here. There's always that much activity when we have a party. Well, this doesn't seem a bit like a party. Wait a minute. Doctor's right...a party, yeah. It's a long shot, but it's worth a gamble. Come on, boys, a party. Sing. Come on, come on. [crowd muttering] [indistinct singing] [concertina music] [laughter] [indistinct singing] [concertina music] [singing in foreign language] Hey, you, you're drunk. You're drunk. [cheering] I'll get you. Shh, shh. Quiet. Quiet. Shh. Quiet. [concertina music] Bennett, he's-he's done it. Get up. [dramatic music] [male #9] 'Charlie's broken through.' Thank God for that. Bill, now listen to me. We miscalculated. It comes out this side of the trees. Forty foot from a goon tower. - Oh, my God, no. - Yeah. Now, listen, the first chap that gets out gets into the trees, see. Soon as he sees it's all clear he chucks a pebble into the hole. That's the signal for the next bloke to move on. Alright? Have you got it in your silly head now? - Yeah. - You're quite sure? - Yeah. - Well, it's a good thing. I wanna you see up and front. - Hennis. - Right. - Good luck. - Good luck, matey. Good luck. Okay, Robinson. Come on, come on. Are you alright? No. No, I'm not alright. And I'm not going. Who you going with? I'm to join.. I'm to join Osborne at the station. Well, go on, get going. Look, I don't want a Jerry bullet in the back. This war can't last forever. [Cole] 'You've been teamed up with Pringle.' 'And he can't speak French. He's depending on you.' To hell with him! To hell with the lot of you! A man like that will be no use to Pringle. Nor to anyone else. [Cole] 'How 'bout it, Pringle?' I'm on my way. When do we go? Get a few more out first. [instrumental music] Um, Robinson pulled out on me. - He what? - What? I'll have to take a chance on my French. Come with us. No, three together, we can't do that, it's much too dangerous. You better replace Robinson and go with him. What, and dump you? We we have no choice. I know my French is lousy, but without it you don't stand a chance. Yeah, well...I should've thought of that before. Well, I'm off. See you at the Rose and Crown. Won't you? [dramatic music] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Um, ya. [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [man on PA speaking foreign language] Thank God you're alright. We've only got a few seconds to talk. Yes, but, what are you doing here? You told me about the escape at 26, Lamsdorf. You're crazy, you're mad, you should never have come here but...I'll never forget you for it. Thank you. They won't look for an escaped prisoner if he's travelling with a woman. But you can't come with me, Irena. If they found you were helping me to es.. If they found you helped me to escape, they'd shoot you. Whenever I talk German to you say "ja". But it-it's too dangerous. It's dangerous to talk English here. [speaking in foreign language] Ja. Mien Gott. [speaking in foreign language] - So, where are we going? - The dining car. I had to get you away from that old man. [speaking in foreign language] Fraulein. Bulgarian? [speaking in foreign language] You think we got away with it? I'm not sure, but.. ...we'll find out as soon as we reach Vienna. Oh, no. No, no, just stay here a minute. But not for long. We're supposed to be in the dining car, remember? I didn't like the way that old man looked at us. He could be here any second. We could be caught at any second.. ...and never see each other again. Would that mean...much to you? Yes. All I can do now is get your tickets straight through to Budapest and.. ...see you safely aboard. Irena...when this war is over.. ...I'm gonna come back and find you, I want to try. I promise. You'd better, sergeant major. We must go now. It's not safe for you here on the station. They always check up on people. I think I'll better go ahead and get your ticket. Alright. Uh, I'll give you the money. Will, uh, 50 do? I'll follow you. [woman on PA speaking foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [woman on PA speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] You looking for me? [speaking in foreign language] [woman on PA speaking in foreign language] Hello, Charlie. Well...that was a bit of a washout, wasn't it? [male narrator] And so, we were shipped to another work compound. This time at the infamous IG Farbon plant. Located near a concentration camp who's name is now a symbol for the most bestial depravity.. ...in the entire history of mankind. Finally, when the Allies closed in, we were driven relentlessly further and further to the West. Until one day, Billy Pope and I managed to escape somehow and.. ...we posed as workmen, cleaning up the rubble. [engine revving] [engine revving] Hold it, put your hands over your head. Oh, look behind you. Oh, mate, are we glad to see you. I'm Sergeant Major Coward. The Royal Artillery. I'm trying make my way to the American lines. Yeah, uh, m-me too. You only have a mile to go. Only a mile? You'll never make it, buddy, there's a road full of krauts between here and there. - Good luck anyway. - Good luck. - Yeah, ta. - Ta. Four years a-waiting. - Good luck. - Good luck. Bye-bye. And one little mile full of krauts. One tiny bloody mile. Might just as well be a thousand. Have you ever wanted to be a fireman? Have I what? A fireman, 'cause now's your chance, come on, out. [bell ringing] Oh, cross your legs, Charlie, here they come. Too late, mate.
