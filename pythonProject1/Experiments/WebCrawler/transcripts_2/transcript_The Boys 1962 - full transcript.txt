I swear by almighty God that I will faithfully try the issues joined between the Queen and the prisoners at the bar, and true verdict give. Are you all sworn? Members of the jury, the prisoners stand indicted for that they on 15th January 1962 in the county of London murdered Arthur Walter Baxter in the course of theft. They have pleaded not guilty. It is your charge to say, having heard the evidence, whether they be guilty or not. Sit down. My Lord, I prosecute in this case with my learned friend, Mr Crowhurst. The defendants are represented by Mr Montgomery and Mr Morris. My Lord, members of the jury, the prosecution's case is that the 4 defendants conspired to rob a garage, known as the Lantern Garage, situated in Perth Street in the West End of London - and that this plan led to the savage murder by the accused of one Arthur Baxter, who was the night attendant at that garage. I'll bring before you evidence of four hooligans on the rampage in the suburbs and in the West End of London, who knew where to find about ?100 in cash. This money was kept in the cash box in the office of the Lantern garage. I will show you how the four defendants left their homes in Wharf End in the East End of London, scandalised, intimidated and brow-beat their way to Perth Street, broke into the garage through the side door, and opened the cash box to find not ?100, but 15 shillings. I put it to you that when they were surprised in their act of plunder by this 74-year-old widower, Arthur Baxter, they brutally put him to death with a knife. Describe to us the scene that met your eyes. The body of the deceased was behind the desk, doubled up. The clothing was dishevelled and very bloodstained. In the deceased's hand was a ?1 note. The floor was covered in blood, files from an open cabinet were scattered about. There'd been a violent struggle. Did you perform a post-mortem examination on Arthur Baxter? I did. On the morning of January 16th. Would you tell us what you found? The main artery leading from the heart had been severed. There was a severe haemorrhage in the left lung. There were six deep incisions in the upper back, penetrating to about three inches. There were two incisions in the upper left lung, two between the left clavicle and the spine, two in the lower artery. With what were these incisions consistent? They were consistent with having been made by a knife or sharp blade. Acting on the statements of the accused, I ordered the area around Waterloo Bridge to be dragged. What did you find, Superintendent Larner? A knife, my Lord. Would you look at this please? Exhibit seven. This is the knife, my Lord. You are an analytical chemist at the police laboratories? - Yes. - Would you look at that knife, and tell this court whether it was the one you examined. Yes, that's the one. You found specks of blood underneath the blade and analysed it. What were your findings? I compared it with blood from the deceased. They were identical. Expand on that statement please... - See if Patrick Bell's arrived. - Yes. The knife had been in water some time... - No sign of Patrick Bell. - What is the idiot playing at? - He has rather a long distance to travel. - So have we. - Your name is George Henry Tanner. - Yes, sir. Address his Lordship, will you please? And is your address 18 Acorn Lane, Wembley? Yes, sir. Are you the owner of the Lantern Garage, Perth Street, Soho? I am. - Was Arthur Baxter employed by you? - Yes, he was. Now... I want you to look at the defendants and tell his Lordship and the jury if you recognise any one of them. - Er, yes. - Who? - Er, the one at the end. - You mean Coulter? Yes, sir. Would you tell this court how you recognise the defendant Coulter? Yeah. He's an apprentice mechanic, sir. He works for my friend Mr Champney who runs a garage in Hackney. He visited my garage with his boss. - When? - Just after Christmas. Tell us what happened, Mr Tanner. Take your own time and watch his Lordship's pencil. Er, well, I always work in the office till about seven at night. This was about 4.30 in the afternoon. Hang around, Stan, I'll only be a minute. Anybody home? Harry! How have you been since Christmas? I got your card, thanks. See, I'm in the money. - That's my apprentice Stan, remember? - Yes, I remember. - What's the matter, Harry? - I'm in a bit of a jam about storage space. - I was wondering... - If it's about that shed, I sold it. I got an offer I couldn't resist. Sid, this is Mr Champney. He owns the garage in Hackney. Harry, this is Sid, my day man. - How are you? - Hi. - That's a bit risky, isn't it? - What? The cash box isn't hidden. Haven't you got a safe yet? - How much you got in there? - Never more than ?100. You must be round the bend! A business like this with no safe. It's on order, I promise you. Here. There. It's on order. It's all right. It's not fair on Arthur. He's got to stay here all night. - I usually empty it at midnight. - I wouldn't like his job at night. The safe is coming. It'll be all right. - You know the trouble with you? - What? You worry too much. When he saw you looking at him, he averted his eyes from you and the cash box? Yes, sir. - Sly and furtive, you said? - Yes, sir. Isn't it strange, Mr Tanner, that you didn't have a safe? Yeah, well, I've been meaning to get one. I should have got one, but you'll have to put that down to a trusting nature. - I've been taken for a mug many times before. - Yes, quite. About the night of January 15th. - Did you empty the cash box? - Er, yes. About midnight as usual? No, no. It was a Thursday, and I wanted to take the cash at about 10.30 because there were wages to make up. and my wife objects if I sit up late. How much was left in the cash box at 10.30 on the night of January 15th? Oh, about... er... 15 bob. 15 shillings. Tell me, Mr Tanner. Would Coulter have known that you always empty the cash box early on a Thursday? I didn't mention that at the time. Thank you. That's all. - Mr Carlton... - Tanner... - What? - Tanner. Mr Tanner. You're a trusting man. Yes, sir. More than ordinarily trusting. Yes, sir. Much more than ordinarily trusting. You trust anybody. It never occurred to you anybody might want your cash box. That's correct, sir. So trusting that you watched the defendant Coulter every moment that he stood there? - Oh, but... - You did on your own admission. "I watched the defendant Coulter. He had a sly and furtive expression as he watched the cash box." Yes, but I mean, it's obvious he was watching the cash box. - Some you trust and some you don't? - That sort of look I don't trust. What is there about that face you wouldn't trust? Well, er... It's the er... the eyes and the mouth. That's only my opinion. Do you believe that there's a criminal type of face? Yes, I do. Yes, I do! - That face, for instance? - Well, as I said, it's only my opinion. We must certainly never forget that it's only your opinion. Mr Tanner, you've been asked whether you trusted the face of the defendant Coulter. Did you have any reason to trust his face or him? No. None at all. And to quote your own words, you have been taken for a mug before? Yes, sir. That's all, Mr Tanner. Thank you. Call... Er... Charles Mark Salmon. Are you employed as a conductor by the London Transport Executive? Yes. Look at the defendants, Mr Salmon. Have you seen them anywhere before? Yes. Tell us where and when. I saw these boys at the stop in East Indies Street. There was quite a bit of fighting. INDISTINCT SHOUTING Hang on, fellas! 'Ere, fellas! All right, lady? Let me give you a hand. I don't want none of that on my bus. - None of what? - Put that knife away. - I'm putting it away. - You nearly killed that old lady. What old girl? Don't give me that. I've got six at home. If they were like you, I'd beat them! You can start on me, mate! Not on the bus, but I'll meet you outside! - Let's get off then! - No, you get off. All of you! All right. Give us your fares. Give them to me, fellas. There's your wages. Now go and get them, eh? I'm sorry, sir. - Get out of it! - Excuse me! Get out of it, you ruffians! - Was this the knife? - Yeah. - It was this sort of knife. - Definitely this type of knife. I remember him closing it. Now, throughout this incident, you said that Coulter's attitude was surly, aggressive and menacing, didn't you Definitely. Thank you, Mr Salmon. What newspapers do you read? - Newspapers? - Mmm. Newspapers. Well, I suppose the Daily Mirror. On Sundays, the Sunday Express. News of the World? On your way to work yesterday, did you read your paper? I glanced at the headlines. - Is that all? - I haven't got time for more. What do you do with your time? I work, sir. I work very hard. Speak to his Lordship, will you? Do you work overtime? Yes, my Lord. How much do you earn? With all deductions, about ?11 a week. - That's including overtime. - What are your commitments? - How many have you got in your family? - Eight of us. You must have an anxious life. How do you manage? I get by. You don't have time to think or read, it must be one long headache. I manage. I cope. I get on top of things. Are you an out-patient at St Thomas's Hospital? Yes, I am. Being treated for a nervous disorder? Yes, I am. We'd better change the subject, hadn't we? When you first saw these boys, what was your impression? I don't know what you mean. What sort of people did they seem to be, Mr Salmon? Milkmen? Postmen? Politicians? Teddy boys. - What do you mean by teddy boys? - Well... They dressed like Teddy Boys and they behaved like... Teddy Boys. Have you got any Teddy Boys in your family? - Oh, no. - How do you know? They don't behave like hooligans, sir. Not that I know of. I hope they don't. I hope so too. Thank you. My learned friend is interested in your private life. - Tell me, do you have a happy home life? - Oh, yes, sir. Are your children troublesome? No, no. - Do you manage to live on your wages? - We always have done, sir, and we always shall. Thank you, Mr Salmon. That's all. That'll do, Mr Salmon. Call Samuel Wallace. - He's here. - Where was he? I met him coming back from the Tower. - The Tower? - Should be in the bloody Tower. Do you know the defendant Stanley Coulter? - Yes, I do. - Has he ever been to your billiard hall? Yes. But I should tell you that he'd been barred from the hall because he was a troublemaker. No, Mr Wallace. What can you tell us about the evening of January 15th? Oh. Certainly, yes. It was quiet, see? Early in the evening, I was at the snack bar, serving a customer, when I first saw him come in. What do you want? I can see there's nothing doing here. Not for you there isn't. Go on, off out of it. I'm looking for somebody. Not in here, you're not. Look outside. How can I look outside if he's in here? What happens if I don't go? Wheatley's over there. He's liable to go raving mad. I'll pay him back. How? You haven't got 50 quid. Tell him I'll have 50 quid. Tell him I'll have a lot more. You? Come on, Stan. That's about the size of it, yes. Yes. Same colour. Yes. Same type of knife. You say that Coulter was barred? Did he know he was barred? He certainly did. I made that very plain to him. He was a scorer at snooker games. He used to get a percentage of the winnings. He mis-scored in favour of a player and the game was declared void. We believed he'd done it deliberately. Thank you, Mr Wallace. Mr Wallace, your customers play for stakes. Have you got a licence for gambling? No, sir. They do it without me knowing. I see. On this night when Coulter made a mistake with the marking, did you know they were gambling for ?50? No, sir. I found out when the bubble burst. I see. What do you do when you find they're gambling? I sling them out, sir. But my facts are that on this occasion, it wasn't the gamblers, it was Coulter who was "slung out". Well, I... Speak to his Lordship. Are those the facts or aren't they? Well, yes, they are, but... No buts. I put it to you that if Coulter had been gambling, he wouldn't have been slung out. He might have been. He was an undesirable. What do you mean by that? He was always on the fiddle. Always trying to con people. Oh, you mean he wasn't gambling for ?50? No re-examination, my Lord. Thank you, Mr Wallace. Call Randolph St John. - And you are a stockbroker? - Yes. On January 15th, were you driving along Wharf End Broadway? Yes, I was. - At about what time? - About 7.15 pm. Kindly look at the defendants over there, and tell his Lordship and the jury if you've ever seen them before. - All of them. That night. - What happened? One of my tyres went flat and I pulled up rather quickly. Another fellow behind me brushed my bumper. I got out and we exchanged a few words. You've got a blow out anyhow. There's no garage around here. Wait a minute. Phone this number. - They'll send a man along. - Thank you. Get away from there! - What are you doing? - You've got a blow out. That's nothing to do with you. Clear off! And if you find something valuable, you're welcome to it! - Careful, Ralph. - I'm not intimidated by a few thugs! - Careful who you're calling names. - Here's some money. Now go away! Don't give them money! - There are four of them! - I don't care! - They've gone. - It's just like Chicago! It's just like bloody Chicago. Look at this thing. If I'd had time, I'd have called a policeman. You were frightened? I wasn't frightened, so much as the lady. I don't believe they'd have done much. Their type is a coward at heart. Thank you, Mr St John. You didn't call a policeman because you hadn't time? Yes. I suggest that the real reason you didn't call a policeman, was because the lady with you wasn't your wife. That is nonsense. I suggest it was your attitude that was aggressive, not the defendants. I suggest that you wanted to put up a show for your lady. Absurd! I wasn't threatening them. Now, one last question, Mr St John. When you first saw these boys surrounding your car, what was your impression - your first reaction? What sort of boys were they? Describe them. They were trying to steal from the boot of my car. No, no. I mean, what sort of boys? - Uncouth? - Yes. - Uncivilised? - Yes. - Teddy Boys? - Oh, yes. Thank you. Mr St John, was the lady you were with that day known to your wife? Certainly. Did your wife know you were taking her to the theatre? Yes. - Who was this young lady? - My wife's sister. Thank you. That'll be all. Worth a try. Robert Norman Albert Brewer. And your occupation? I'm employed by borough council as attendant in gentleman's convenience, Wharf End Broadway. Mr Brewer, look at the four accused, please. Have you ever seen them before? Yes, I have. They all come into my washroom that evening. Tell us what happened please. Well, I was outside in office, see, and I heard this row, so I come down the steps... INDISTINCT SHOUTING He shoots! Goal! 'Ere! Where do you think you are? - Playing for Spurs, of course! - No, it's West Ham, innit? Behave yourselves. I've had enough of yobbos. What do you mean, yobbos? Be careful what you call people, grandad. Just get out of here, go on! Me, him, him and him are coming into some money, then we won't have to come down this stinking hole. That's right. Not after tonight we won't. We're only your best customers. Go on. Sling your hooks. Get out of it, smelly. And you're not coming, I told you! - I'm coming. - You're not old enough, Billy! - I'm old enough to go to his garage! - Get lost! You'll get us all nicked. You heard him. Now, stay here! They left the young one, but he ran after them. Let's be sure of their words, Mr Brewer. Herne said, "Me, him, him and him are coming into some money"? Yes, sir. And Coulter said they wouldn't go down there again after that night. - What did you understand by that? - They could afford a better place. And Herne said, "I'm old enough to go to the garage." Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr Brewer. Don't leave us just yet, Mr Brewer. - How old are you? - 70, sir. - What was your job before you retired? - A carpenter, sir. What was your wage when you were a carpenter? Anything between 13-14 pound a week, sir. And what's your wage now? Altogether, ?3.18 a week, sir. Do you think a boy of 17 today gets too much money? Yes, sir, I do. - You called these boys "yobbos"? - Yes, sir. Yobbos? What do you mean by yobbos? Er... Yobbos is er... layabouts. Why layabouts? They were just out for the evening, weren't they? I know yobbos. They're Teds. Are you proud of being a lavatory attendant? That's a most unseemly question. The witness needn't answer it. Well, I will answer it. I am proud. Very proud. Pardon, m'Lud. I withdraw the question. You can't. The witness has answered it. I'm sorry, m'Lud. Thank you, Mr Brewer. It's all right, Mr Brewer. You can go now. Call Gordon Percy Lonsdale. - Is Patrick Bell still out there? - Yes. Stay with him till he's called. We can't have him wandering off again. I was with the Ministry of Pensions. I'm retired now. Speak up please, and address his Lordship. Sorry. I was with the Ministry of Pensions for 32 years. I'm retired. Where were you on January 15th at about 8.30 pm? I was in a queue outside the Princess Cinema in the West End. It was my wedding anniversary. I'm a widower. Look at the four accused, Mr Lonsdale. - Have you ever seen them before? - Yes. Outside the cinema that night. - Did you have cause to speak to them? - I did. They were causing a nuisance. One at ten shillings! BILLY: One at ten shillings! - One ten shilling, please. - Sorry. There's a queue. I'm in it. You have to wait for the commissionaire to call. But he... Won't they serve you? Ever been had then? Good picture? Enjoy the picture? A bit short though. I bet that film steamed your glasses up! Aren't you 16 yet? Move off or I'll call a policeman. No, I'm stopping. This if for everybody. I can stay here. - I'll give you a minute. - I'm stopping. This is a public thoroughfare. I saw you do that! You're the sort who'll end up in prison. The type who hits old ladies over the head at night. You ought to be in an institution. - What are you talking about? - You just cut that down! - I didn't cut nothing. - Don't come that on me! Everybody saw you do it. Look at the blade of your knife, huh? Yes. This is the knife, my Lord. When he tried to cut the rubbish bin, he made a pattern of blunt edges that I remember very clearly. Are you absolutely sure of this? Oh, absolutely, yes. Thank you. Part of your evidence was, "as soon as I saw them" meaning my clients, "I recognised them as wild, aggressive and surly." Can you recognise these qualities in people on sight? I think I can, yes. Could tell us where you took your degree in psychiatry? I haven't taken any degree. Not? Oh. I suggest it was your attitude that was wild, aggressive and surly, and it provoked these incidents you so graphically described. That's nonsense, it's not true. Very well, whether it's true or not, perhaps you could demonstrate to the court these qualities you possess, the ability to recognise the wild, aggressive and surly. M'Lud? I would like to call a person who I may call later as a defence witness. - What do you want to do with him? - I want him to stand beside me to assist this witness demonstrate his power of character assessment. Have you any objection, Mr Webster? None at all, my Lord. Very well. Call Patrick Bell. Patrick Bell! Just stand there, Mr Bell. Will you take off your overcoat? Now, this gentleman has certain physical characteristics. Perhaps the court may hear your judgment of his character. I wouldn't dream of doing that. I've no wish to insult the gentleman. He's prepared for anything you have to say. How does he strike you? I can't do that. Why not? Because this is a law court, not a public street? Come along, Mr Lonsdale. Be bold. In his natural environment, I'd say he possessed some of these features. If you want me to be more explicit, the hair, the sideburns, the forehead, those clothes. But I could be wrong. I'm not infallible. What is his "natural environment"? I don't know. Of course I don't know. Could you also be wrong about the defendants? I wasn't though, was I? They behaved like vandals. Thank you. Will you wait outside? Now, I'm going to ask you once more. Was there anything in your attitude that provoked the defendants into this vandalism? Nothing at all. Thank you. Mr Lonsdale, about the serrations on the blade of the knife. Have you any doubt that this was the knife you saw? None at all. Thank you, Mr Lonsdale. That's all. - You're a shop assistant? - Yes. On January 15th, were you in the saloon bar of the Knight's Arms public house, Tottenham Court Road at about 9pm? - Yes. - Would you speak up. - Pardon? - Would you speak up? Yes. Do you remember meeting any of the defendants there? I do. Tell the court what happened. I was sitting at the bar with a friend. We were going dancing. 'These two fellas come up.' Hello, darling. Drink up. Where are we going? - Where are we going then? - Go away. Where are we going? I thought we were going dancing. That's right. Dancing. Look at the time. Excuse us. We've got business. There's time. We're laughing here. We've got to get ready. - We've got an appointment. - The nerve! I suppose you think we're a couple of tarts. "We've got some business to do." Is that right? Yes. "There's time," said Coulter. Thompson said, "We've got to get ready." - Yes. - Thank you. - You objected to them, Miss May? - Yes, I did. You're sitting in the bar of a public house and you object because two boys talk to you? It wasn't that. I just didn't like them. - Why? - I don't like Teds. - Why? - They're roughs. They're trouble. - I suggest to you that you didn't object... - I certainly did. Will you let me finish! And you were waiting to be picked up. Your objection was that they left you in the lurch. That's not true. All right. Do you frequent public houses, Miss May? No, not usually. We were waiting for the dance to start swinging. Thank you. That's all. - Call... - Ann Celia Barker. Are you employed as a barmaid at the Three Aces public house in Perth Street? I am. Is it possible to see the Lantern Garage from the window of your bar? Oh, yes. It's only about 30 yards away and it's all lit up at night. There are four accused here, Miss Barker. Would you tell his Lordship and the members of the jury if you've ever seen them before. Yes. They all came into the bar on the evening of January 15th. It was about 20 to 11. 'When they sat down, I couldn't see what they were doing, 'but then I went to collect some pots.' Nothing to worry about. It's a garage like any other. Do what you're told and you can't go wrong. Ah, come on, let's have it away. Here you are, Stan, it's like this. Look at this cigarette packet, would you? Do you recognise it? Yes. This is the one. Did you see who did that drawing? Yes, it was that one. What were the others doing? Oh, they kept looking at the garage. Would the usher show that to the jury? Members of the jury, you will see that there are two drawings like petrol pumps in front of a building. Miss Barker, how many petrol pumps are there at the Lantern Garage? There are two. I thought they were drawing the garage. I thought, "Trouble", as soon as I saw them. - What did you do the following morning? - I contacted the police. The detective found the plan in a dustbin. Thank you, Miss Barker. "I thought, "trouble", as soon as I saw them" you just said. Why did you think trouble, Miss Barker? I expect trouble all the time in that district. Let me put this to you. If an identical situation had arisen and they'd been dressed in city suits with short hair, you wouldn't have thought "trouble" then? No, of course not. I know this type. No more questions. I'm a little surprised that you've no further questions, either about the cigarette packet or the conversation about the garage, or the defendants looking through the windows. No, my Lud, I accept the witness's statement. I have no questions. Neither have I, my Lord. Thank you, Miss Barker. My Lord, members of the jury, that is the case for the prosecution. We're past time, Mr Webster, so I shall adjourn. Be upstanding. All persons having anything further to do... I knew that cigarette packet would do it. He hasn't got a case now. We'll get a decision tomorrow. Tell Hodgson we can take that brief in Exeter. Right. You lost the knife. I told you, I lost it the following day. If you'd lost it then, somebody else might have used it. They've identified your knife! - It couldn't have been mine. - Why are you so certain? I told you, I put it by my bed. Did any of you see it after that? - You may have lost it. - I didn't see it. I still had it when I got home. All right. Now, Webster is... Will you listen to me?! Webster is blackening your characters to such an extent that you'll be found guilty, knife or no knife. You tell me what the witnesses say is true. I can't go on shouting "circumstantial evidence"! You've got to give me something to go on. - We've told you. - You haven't. Look at the statements you made. You confirm everything they say. You threatened an old man - you've admitted it. You took a... You took a pound off a girl, you said so. You deliberately slashed the rubbish bin. Don't you understand? This is hooliganism right across London. I thought you were defending us. What have you given me to defend? You throw a fare across the bus. Why were you using a knife on a bus? Cleaning your nails? You don't believe anything we say... If I believed you, you'd be found guilty on your own admission! You spread your net of terrorism half over London! Listen to me. You knocked down an old woman at the bus stop. - I was going to apologise. - Not good enough! - I was going to apologise. - Don't keep saying that like a parrot! Why were you looking through the door of the garage? I wasn't looking at the cash box. I can't remember what it was. You'll have to remember, if we stay here all night. What are you hiding that's more important than yourself, you idiot? - Lay off him. - I'm not paid to lay off him! Leave him alone, you fat old...! He didn't mean it. Billy. Why is fat a swear word? - I didn't mean it. - You used it as a swear word. - He didn't. He just called you fat. - Yes, he did. No, he didn't! I knew about that word long before you were born! I've never been allowed to forget it. - He's said he's sorry, didn't he? - What difference does that make? Does it help him understand why he said it? Or what happened to me when he said it? I was back at school, standing far away from the swimming pool. - Why? - I didn't want to be pushed in, you chump. Work it out yourself. A fat boy has to stay at the back. If he doesn't, you can depend upon some youngster singing out, "Look at that fat man." Well, we've dealt with fat boys. Let's talk about Teddy Boys. I've told you more about myself than any of you have told me about yourselves. I don't want you to go into the box and just repeat what's written here. I want the court to hear what Ginger and Barney and Stan and Billy are really like behind this great tough act. And, remember, you'll be dealing with Victor Webster. My Lord, members of the jury, in the case for the prosecution, you have heard that the four defendants set out, on the evening of January 15th, with a plan to rob a garage. Any number of witnesses have stated that they betrayed their intentions by advertising them in a vicious, unruly and boastful manner. It has been repeatedly suggested that they entered the garage, were intercepted by the attendant, stabbed him to death, and on the way home, they threw the knife, the weapon of murder, into the Thames. Then they conspired together to conceal from this court the responsibility for this savage act. You have heard Coulter's knife identified before and after the crime. A cigarette packet, a manner of behaving, all these have been brought before you as evidence. They are nothing but a farrago of circumstantial evidence which would never have got to court had the defendants not finished their evening near the garage, hadn't happened to leave the public house moments before the murder. Apart from that, my clients have no case to answer. I shall show you that the knife is one of thousands on sale in London of an exactly similar make, and that the serrations on the blade could be easily reproduced. The defendants crossed the bridge that night, but so did thousands of others, on foot, by bus, and in innumerable cars. You will wish to hear of the hooligan behaviour of these boys. My Lord, they will go into the box and you will hear an unbiased account. This was a perfectly ordinary outing, as innocent and as innocuous occasion as any upon which four boys of this age have organised an evening out, on that barren Thursday night before payday. Call Stanley Herbert Coulter. Take the book and repeat the words on the card. I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. You're Stanley Herbert Coulter and you live at 106 Grand Buildings, Wharf End? Yes, sir. First, remember what Mr Tanner said about your seeing his cash box and overhearing the conversation? - What have you got to say about that? - It didn't happen like he said, sir. Sid, this is Mr Champney. He owns the garage in Hackney. Sid's my day man. - How do? - Hi. - That's a bit risky, isn't it? - What? The cash box isn't hidden. Haven't you got a safe yet? - How much is in there? - Never more than ?100. You're round the bend! A business like this with no safe. It's on order, I promise you. Here. It's on order. It's all right. It's not fair on old Arthur He's got to stay here with that, you know. I take out what's in it at 12. - I wouldn't like his job at night. - I know. The safe is coming. It's all right. - You know the trouble with you? - What? You worry too much. - Is this the calendar? - Yes, sir. Exhibit 13. Members of the jury, you'd better see it. Of course, you did see the cash box being opened. Yes, I did see that, sir. Did you at any time plan to rob the garage? No, sir. Let's come to the events of January 15th. It's been said that you left home that evening with a plan to go to town and break into a garage. Is this true? No, sir. We hadn't intended to go out at all that night. I'd seen Billy outside the building site where Ginger works and I went over. # Tote that barge! # Lift that bale! Is that all you managed to do then? - Don't kid us you're working. - Hello, Stan. That's a man's job, not for nippers! You couldn't do this if you tried. - Let's have a go then. - Oh, no! The union would have something to say about that, eh, Charlie? That's right, Ginge. You're scared to have a man on the job! Hey! You going out tonight? - Going out tonight, Stan? - I'll think about it. What you gonna do if not? Gonna watch telly? There's a good show on. You watch it. TRAIN RUMBLES PAST - I suppose the doctor left here quickly. - She was here all morning. Should have got a man doctor. She don't know what she's doing half the time. Here, give me that, I'll take it. I've done some bread and butter pudding. Grub's up. Come and get it. Let's have you then. Oof! You weigh a ton. Nice bit of fish. Cooked specially for you in the grill room of the Savoy Hotel. I'm obliged. Them flats are going up quick, eh? Yeah.. We'll have one of them ourselves soon. That's right. With bells on. No, straight up. The town clerk's put us on top of the list. Pull the other one, Stan. Ask Dad what's happened to that wireless. Them floorboards are damp again. I'll see Dad about it. Hey, how do you fancy a bit of bread and butter pud? All right, mate. - She don't want any pudding. - Take her some just in case. - I told you, she don't want any. - All right! She's been going on about those new flats again. - You been down the council? - What's the use? - There were 4, 000 on the waiting list. - Keep on at them. - She can't stay here. - You go down? - I've been. - Then stop blaming me. Her wireless has busted again. It's that damp. - I'll fix it. - You'll fix it? KNOCKING KNOCKING - That's my mum's room there! - I forgot. You coming out? If I can make some money, I'll go to the dogs. I got ten bob. So open a bank account. Now buzz off. - Should I get my hair cut? - I don't know. You'll wake my mum. Don't you shift yourself, will ya? Stan? Stan. Stan. You ain't half a lot of trouble, waking all the neighbours... Get me some fags. Don't tell your dad. You know you're not allowed to smoke. Oh, go on, get me some fags. Bring them back with you. - It'll go to your chest. - My chest is all right. - All right, mate. - Take it. - You keep it. Have a smoke on me. - Oh, thanks. Gotcha! Why don't you get off my back? - I can go to the dogs. - You're not old enough. I'm 16, aren't I? INDISTINCT CHATTER - I've got the money. - Get off my back, will ya? Shove off! - Let's go to the dogs. - You're too young. I'm 16! - Watch it! - I'm sorry, Stan. What are we gonna do tonight? So the plan wasn't to go to London at all, or to rob a garage? The plan was to get some marking to finance an evening at the dogs. Yes, sir. Mr Salmon has said that he saw you fighting at the bus stop, that you knocked down a lady, jumped on the bus, brandished a knife, and when you saw him, you threatened to beat him up. Is he right? Well, yes, sir, but it didn't happen at all like he said. When Billy and me got to the bus stop, 'Ginger was going on about his union card.' He's not a member! - Hello, fellas. - Stan and me's going to the dogs. - It's a mug's game. - Are you going to meet a bird? We might go to the pictures. Yeah. Stan, how's your mum? - She had the doctor today. - No, she didn't. - She's a woman doctor, ain't she? - No. She's a man doctor. Stan, your mum got cancer? Here, he was only asking! Stan! Here! Here, fellas! Here, hang on, fellas. Hang on, fellas. That's nice. You've just knocked some old girl over. What old girl? - There. Look. - Where? I didn't even see her, did I? - It was when you pushed Billy. - I didn't do it. It's him pushing. She must be all right or he wouldn't have started the bus. - You should have picked her up. - I didn't knock her down. - He knocked her down. - You always pick on me. - Who says it was us? - Go and say you're sorry. - Go and tell them you're sorry. - You pushed me. Just go and say you're sorry. All you've got to do is say, "Sorry, I didn't see you." - If it's easy, you go down. - All right. I'll go down. I don't want none of that on my bus! - None of what? - Put that knife away. I'm putting it away. You nearly killed an old girl. - What old girl? - Don't give us that cobblers. I've got six at home. If they were like you, I'd give them a belting. You can start with us, mate! - I'll meet you outside anytime! - We'll get outside then. Come on, you get off. Come on. All right, fellas. Give us your fares. Give them to me. There you are, mate. There's your wages. Go and get them. I didn't see the lady, sir. I was cleaning my nails with my knife. It's a habit I got. Yes? I'd like to say I'm sorry now, if it'll do any good. To the old lady? I'm sure she'd accept your apology. Mr Wallace, the manager of the billiard hall, has spoken of your menacing attitude. You said, referring to a Mr Wheatley, "Tell him I'll have 50 quid. Tell him I'll have a lot more." It wasn't my idea to say that, sir. When we got off the bus, we walked down Broadway and Barney and Ginger split off to go to the pictures. You stay down here. - I can go up there. I'm 16. - No! It's dead dodgy in there. If there's a game, I'll call you. You've got to find ?50 for Wheatley. He's probably forgotten it by now. Anyway, I only made a mistake with the scoring. - You can tell him you'll get it. - Yeah, with bells on! - You might win it at the dogs. - With my luck? What does you want? I can see there's nothing doing here. Not for you there isn't. Go on, off out of it. I'm looking for somebody. Not in here. Look for him outside. How can I look for him outside? What happens if I don't go? Wheatley's over there. He's liable to go raving mad. - I'll pay him back. - How can you pay him back? You haven't got 50 quid. Tell him I'll have 50 quid. Tell him I'll have a lot more. You? Come on, Stan. - That was quick. - Yeah. A great giggle. - Billy, got that ten bob? - Yeah. - I'll open a bank account for us. - You don't need money for that. So you were on the defensive? Yes, sir. I was scared. I thought he'd clobber me any minute. Had you any intention of paying back the ?50? No, sir. I only made a mistake with the scoring. I'm sorry I did, but I did. I'm not going to ask you about the other incidents. Because I want to hear about them from the others. I just want you to tell His Lordship and the jury about your return home from the Three Aces. And remember, Speak to His Lordship. Yes, sir. Well, my Lord, we all left the pub just before 11 like the lady said. Ginger split off because he'd lost his union card, and Billy, Barney and me had a bit of a row about the fares home. We got that sorted out, and we took the number one bus across Waterloo Bridge straight home. Only I'd forgotten the fags for my mum, and I got them out of this machine by the shops, put them by her bed and went to bed. - And that's everything? - Yes, sir. Thank you. Is it your practice to terrorise bus conductors with knives? No. I was just putting it away, sir. Where is it now, Coulter? I lost it the following day. I wish I could find it, sir. - That's it, isn't it? - No, sir. Not if it's got blood on, it's not. I didn't kill him. None of us did. You knew where the cash box was and you were within yards of it at 11. You thought there'd be ?100 in it, but there wasn't. You killed Mr Baxter and threw the knife in the Thames. This is true, isn't it? No, sir. None of it's true, sir. I didn't even know we was near the garage, sir. I wouldn't have recognised it in the dark. Now, Coulter, supposing you had killed Baxter, you decided to lie and the knife had been identified in the same way, how would you have explained the knife? Well, sir, I would have said I'd lost it that day and somebody must have picked it up. But I had the knife when I got home. Thank you, Coulter. All right. Go back there. Brian Harold Lee. Take the book and repeat the words on the card. I swear by Almighty God the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. You are Brian Harold Lee and you live at 82, Grand Buildings, Wharf End? Yes, sir. You're a labourer for a removal firm in Stepney. Yes, sir. Now, we're interested in a plan for breaking into a garage at the instigation of Coulter, and stealing ?100 which wasn't there anyway. What can you tell us? Well, there was no plan, sir. Didn't you make a plan with Thompson when you came home? No, sir. That was just like any other Thursday night. My mate gave me a lift home on the van, and he dropped me near Ginger's building site. Righto! This'll do you. Oi, hang on! Oh, Barn, you went base over apex then! - What's all that about? - That's it, Barney. You could have broken my bleeding neck! Oi, you big berk! - Go on, you'll catch him! - Come here! You've been smoking too much, Barney. You could have broke my bleeding neck! Oi! Get him then! WHISTLE BLOWS Here, Charlie, put that away. There's my mate. Just a minute, Barn, I'm with ya. You wait till I see him tomorrow. I wish you was insured, Barney, you'll need to be. - Yeah. I wish this coat was. - You'll be all right. I hope so. It cost a bomb. - Going out tonight? - I'm skint. We could go to the caff. It ain't half been cold up there today. How was it for you? I'm knocked out, had a right hard day. Hurry up. I want you to take this shopping over to Ginger's mum. I'm busy. Look out! Blimey, look what you've done! You've squashed my new shoes. You leave them everywhere. I don't have eyes in the back of my head! You don't have to pay for them. ?38s 11d a pair they cost. You can't get them just anywhere you know - You walk on his winklepickers again? - Again? - Have you trod on these before? - Oh, shaddap! Take this over to Mrs Thompson. You've got a liberty after treading on my shoes. - My legs ain't up to it. - Neither are mine. I've been lifting crates of antiques all day. That's why your legs ache. Give them here. ?3 eight! You're a mug. That's the worst quality leather on the market. They're not made to stand up to her kind of weight, are they? Oh, take the shopping, Barney. - Doctor come to see Mrs Coulter today? - Yeah. Don't wonder she's ill, breathing the kind of air you get here. - They say it's cancer. - You're a right happy pair. - Take the shopping, Barney. - All right, Mum. I will. - You going out? - I'm skint. You haven't got a few bob till tomorrow? You could earn a few quid wearing them in a sideshow. Oh, very funny. You ought to be on the Palladium with jokes like that. HE WHISTLES Come in! - Hello, Mrs Thompson. - Hello, love. Got your shopping here. Thanks, Barney. Put it down. How much was it? Mum didn't tell me. Settle up when you see her. Here you are. - I don't know how much it is. - No. It's for you. - Oh, no, Mrs Thompson. - Go on, go to the pictures with Jim. Thanks, Mrs Thompson. - Enjoy yourselves. - We will. - Coming then? - Yeah, sure. - Ta rah, Jim. - Ta rah. - Don't be late. - No. Ta rah, Barney. Ta rah, Mrs Thompson, and thanks. It's all right. - What's wrong with your shoes? - Someone trod on them! I got my union card today. I've never seen one. Did Coulter tell you about the Lantern Garage or the cash box? No, sir. He didn't mention it, sir. You were supposed to have behaved like vandals and hooligans and to have boasted about stealing the money. One of the witnesses who said you behaved like a thug was Mr St John. Remember he said you intimidated him and his young lady? And that you wouldn't go away till she'd given you a pound? It wasn't like that fella said. Me and Ginger were looking for a film worth seeing. We couldn't find one, so we went to the caff. 'The other fellas were there.' Here, Barney! Hello! I thought you was going to the dogs. - What about the pictures? - Nothing on. Lot of pony. Ta, bill. Here you are. What happened to them two birds you had Saturday? - Went over the park. - What happened? - What do you think happened? - Phwoar! What do you mean phwoar? 16 years old and it's phwoar! - You heard what he said. - He said nothing. - What do you think I meant? - What? - Me and Ginge just went for a walk. - Yeah. That's right. You tell us what happened then? I hope you won't do this when you come to my garage on Monday. He said they went into the park with two birds. - Well? How do I know what happened? - There you are then! - You had an accident? - Oh, cut myself shaving. Shaving? What do you want to shave for? - I shave twice a day. - Twice? It's only bum fluff. It's like a scrubbing brush. Feel it. Feel it. I can't feel nothing. No. That's 'cause I shave twice a day. I got my union card today. You told us about 20 times. BANG AND HORN HOOTS There's something up. Billy, you're starting at the garage Monday, come and help. I'll get dirty. Come on, fellas, get to work. He's had a blow out. How does it open? - You've had a blow out. - That's nothing to do with you! Clear off! - Careful what you say. - I'm not intimidated by thugs! - Watch what you're calling people. - Do you want money? Now go away! - Don't give them money! - There are four of them! - Come here, Bill! Come here! - I'll give you a right good hiding! Give me the money back. I'm warning you, Bill, stop! Give that money back! When I get hold of you! Come here! Come here, Bill! Where's he gone? He's not here! He come down here! Wait a minute, he's in here. Come out! Give that man his money back. She gave it to us! Come on, give it back! We're taking that man's money back! BILLY: We can go to the dogs now. - Send him to Coventry. A majority decision. I'll send him to Coventry when I get hold of him. I'll give him a right good hiding! He's not coming out with me tonight. BILLY: She gave it to us. BARNEY: We're giving it back! - Get him, Barn! So I got the pound off Bill and we went to look for the driver, but we couldn't find him. His car was there, but not him. So we went back to the gents to wash up. - He said you behaved like thugs. - We wanted to help him. We would have changed his wheel for him, but he turned on us, sir. Now, Lee, you're accused of leaving the Three Aces public house, of breaking and entering the garage, and killing the attendant. What did you do when you left the Three Aces? We went straight home, sir. All except Ginge who'd lost his union card. We went straight home on the bus. Stan left us, then I went home. You were raiding that car, weren't you, Lee? No, sir. You didn't try to give Mr St John his money back, you wanted more! That's not true, sir. If there hadn't been people about, you'd have taken care of Mr St John too! M'Lud, I have never heard a more unfair question! I don't think I have either. Mr Webster, I'm surprised. - I'm sorry, my Lord - Anyway, sir, that wasn't true, sir. What did you do with the knife? Did you throw it into the river before the bridge or after it? We didn't get off the bus, sir. We went straight home. All right. You can leave the box. William Henry Herne. Repeat the words on the card. I swear the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. You're William Henry Herne of 92 Grand Buildings, Wharf End? - Yes, sir. - Speak up, Herne. Speak up and address his Lordship. You're an apprentice mechanic with Coulter at a garage in Hackney. - Is that right? - Yes, sir. And you had a diabolical plan on the evening of January 15th, right? No. I just wanted to go out with Stan. What's on the telly? I reckon you'll soon be shaving three times a day. Then four, then five. By the time you're my age, you'll be dead of exhaustion. He'll still be using your razor. I can't help it if my beard grows faster than yours. - Mine? - No, his. Stan shaves twice a day. When you start work with him, use his razor. Tell him to get his hair cut. You're looking more like your mother every day. It's dreadful. - It's the fashion, isn't it? - It ain't half shaggy. - Here, come on. - Where are you going with that? You can't see there. Come to the window. Here we are. Here, you've missed a little bit there. - Where? - No, that's the shadow of his ear. - Watch it, son, you'll need that. - Oh, shut up. - Shut...? My razor, my blades, my soap! - I haven't got any money. Yes, you have. I give you ten bob. When? There it is, look. Oh. Oh, thanks, Dad. - You're not wearing that shirt? - Yeah. Why? - It's filthy. - No, it's not. Well, what about putting the stuff back? - It's all right, duck, I'll do it. - Thanks, Mum. Where are you going? - To buy a razor! - Oh, yeah! So you went to meet Coulter to discuss your plan to rob the garage? - I just called on him. - Hold your head up and speak to his Lordship. Now, then, did you say to Mr Brewer, "Me, him, him and him are coming into money"? Yes, sir. It wasn't anything to do with breaking into garages. After we'd tried to find the girl who'd given us the money, 'they weren't talking to me.' If you're going up west, I'm coming. How does a geezer like that get hold of a bird and a motor like that? Probably a company director. - Cost a thousand quid. - Two thousand. - How can you spend ?2, 000 on a car? - I'm going with you. If you've got it, you spend it. How long would it take me to buy it? ?7.50 into 2, 000 - You ain't a company director. - Why shouldn't I be? That's right. You be a company director. If you're going up west, I'm coming! - What's he got that I haven't got? - ?2,000! You could win the pools. If I won ?100, 000 on the pools, I'd split it four ways, ?80, 000 each! You could buy that flat for your mum, and do you know what I'd have? I'd have a house in the country and under my bedroom window, I'd have a big football pitch, and I'd have Spurs down to play with only me watching them. Then if they were losing at half time, I'd put my gear on, and go out and score some goals... Don't be daft. I would! Look, here's the ball! It's Billy Herne! He's got the ball! 'Ere! Where do you think you are? - Playing for Spurs, of course. - No, it's West Ham, innit? Shut up and behave yourselves. I've had enough of yobbos! What do you mean? Yobbos? Be careful what you're calling people, grandad. Just get out of here, go on! Me, him, him, and him are coming into some money. When we do, we won't come down this rathole, will we, Stan? Right. Not after tonight we won't. We're only your best customers. Go on, sling your hooks. Get out of it, smelly. - You're not coming. - I told you, I'm coming with you. You're not old enough. I'm old enough to go to the garage with him! Get lost. You'll finish up getting us all nicked, my life, you will! You heard him, stay here. What do I want to stay here for? - What were they going to the West End for? - Going dancing. - Not to break into garages? - No. Barney had split this quid up. I had about 14 bob all together. Just a moment. Mr Lonsdale said that outside the cinema you used Coulter's knife to deliberately sever a bin from a lamp-post, and the rubbish tipped into the street. Is that true? Yes, sir. But I wouldn't have done it if he hadn't been there. I got on the train without the others seeing me and we all got out at Piccadilly. 'I saw the others come out over the other side of the street.' Hey! Oi, fellas! Hey, fellas, it's me! Here, Stan, wait for me! - Where are you going? - I'm coming with you! Here, wait for me! INDISTINCT SHOUTING This is a public street! Not a beer garden! A what? Andy Capp, look! Citizens should be able to walk in peace, not have to avoid hooligans. - Behave yourselves. - One at ten shillings! One at ten shillings! THEY LAUGH Wouldn't they serve you then? Ever been had, then? Good film? Good film? Enjoy it? I bet that film steamed up your glasses. Aren't you 16 yet? Move off or I'll call a policeman. Come on, fellas. Ta ta. No. I'm waiting here. This is for everyone. I can stand here. Very well. I'll give you one minute. - Billy, come on. - I'm warning you. - I'm staying. - Don't mess about. It's a public right of way. Come on, Bill. I saw you do that! You're the sort type who'll end up in prison. The type that hits defenceless old ladies. You should be in an institution. I saw you do that. - Dunno what you're talking about. - You cut that down! - I didn't cut nothing. - Don't come that. Everybody saw you. Look at the blade of your knife. When are you going to start growing up? - Billy. - Behaving like a pack of savages. Don't look at me like that. You slashed the bin because you were provoked? Yes. He kept on at me. Herne, did you kill Arthur Baxter? No, sir. I went home with Stan and Barney. We didn't go near the garage. You ask this court to accept that intimidating and terrorising these witnesses was letting off steam? Knives are drawn, money is stolen, people are assaulted! Chaos reigns, but it's only fun?! - I didn't mean... - Speak up! What did you say? I didn't mean to slash the rubbish bin, sir. You left the Three Aces just before 11 o'clock? - Yes. - You forced the door of the garage! - No, sir. - What? No! You killed Arthur Baxter or watched him being killed. No, sir. - You crossed Waterloo Bridge. - Yes, sir. - And threw the knife in! - No. I left the pub. I went straight home. JUDGE: Have you finished, Mr Webster? Yes, m'Lud. That's all, thank you, Herne. Call Patrick Bell. Patrick Bell! Take the book and repeat the words on the card. I swear the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. You're Patrick Bell of 50 Stadium Road, Walthamstow? Yes Tell the court your occupation. Yes. I'm the assistant priest of St Stephen's Church, Walthamstow. Thank you, Mr Bell. What does this mean? My Lord, Mr Lonsdale recognised in this witness's appearance characteristics which he described as "wild, aggressive and surly." Mr Lonsdale said he would be better able to recognise these qualities if he saw Mr Bell in his natural environment. I thought the court would like to know Mr Bell's natural environment. Did you dress up for this? Yes, my Lord. I wanted to help in every way. It's only the clothes. I always wear my hair like this. Mr Montgomery, I will not have this sort of masquerade in this court. - There are other ways to make a point. - I beg your Lordship's pardon. Have you any questions to ask this witness? No, my Lord. - Then kindly call your next witness. - Thank you. James Alan Thompson. Take the book and repeat the words on the card. I swear the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. You're James Alan Thompson of 72 Grand Buildings, Wharf End. Yes. You're an apprentice carpenter on the new flats near your home. Yes, sir. When you came home from work on January 15th, did you intend to go to the West End? No, sir. I met Stan, Billy and Barney, but they didn't know what we was going to do. I walked home with Barney. We got in about 5.30. - Hey, Mum, I got it! - Take your things off the table, Jim! - Take your boots off there! - I'm a member, Mum! - What is it? - It's me union card. "Amalgalmated Society of Woodworkers." Will it keep the money coming in? Don't take your socks off now. - I won't be a minute. - Hurry up, it'll get cold. I just want to put this away safe. - Where did you plan this robbery then? - We didn't, sir. According to Miss May, at 9 pm, you said, "We've got some business." To which Coulter replied, "There's plenty of time." You said, "We've got to get ready, see you later." - Did you say these things? - Yes, sir. After the trouble with that man, we was on our way to the dance hall. We'll have a drink here before the dance. Act with a bit of decorum. Smarten yourself up! We're up West, not down the building site. What about the money? It's five bob each for the dance hall. We need our fares home, so we've got enough for two drinks. I'll get the drinks. Give us a bob. - A bob? We're up West now. - Yeah. One and three. Here you are. Here. Right. SOFT PIANO PLAYS Four light ales, 20 Seniors and some crisps, please. Ginge, there's a couple there. Go and chat 'em up. Come on. They won't pull those birds. - If they go to the dance hall, we go. - Why? - We're broke! - We can meet them inside. Hello, darling. Drink up. Where we going then? - Where we going then? - Go away. Come on, Evie, we're going dancing. Oh, look at the time, Stan. We've got some business to do. There's time. We're laughing here. We've got to get ready. Sorry, darling, we've got an appointment. See you later. What a nerve! We're not a couple of tarts! I told you they wouldn't pull. Well? What happened? - He messed it up. - Shut up. He just doesn't think. Let's go. Maybe we'll find some more birds that he won't mess up. That's a good idea. Come on, Bill. DANCE MUSIC PLAYS Come on. - Here, Stan, where you going? - I don't want a drink. I'm not thirsty. Four cokes. Them birds were just waiting for us. We can't pay their entry in here. - We didn't have to come here. - That's what we come up here for! - I want to be with them birds. - Here they come now. Marvellous. Now you've really done it. Now they'll know we're skint. We'll have to make sure they don't see us. Not me. They didn't see me. Bloody nit! You lay off of me, Stan. - You can have it any time you want! - Fellas. - Bird ain't worth fighting over. - I want a dance. - Not with them birds. - There are other girls. Come on. Let's have a giggle. Come on. What a marvellous night this has turned out to be. Come on, I'm going. He won't dance. I'm not going to dance unless he does. Got blisters, Fred Astaire? I can't dance. My shoes are killing me. This is a square joint. I thought you'd been here before. I should be dancing myself. Where are those two birds of ours? They're dancing with one another. Go and ask that bird to dance. - That old boiler? - The place is full of them! So the great Romeo's come unstuck. - Turn it up, Stan. - Why don't we all turn it up? We can't go yet. It's lucky number night at 10.30. ?45! I don't think she's so bad, Barney. - Where's Billy? - I don't know. - He's dancing. - Where? That Bill is the greatest! Here, hang on, we'll send him up. - She couldn't dance. - You were doing some great steps. - Really? - Oh, great. - You don't learn it all... - Leave off. - Are them birds still there? - Yeah. - We can wait. - We didn't come up here to wait! Why don't you have a dance then? COMPERE: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. The time is now 10.30, and it's lucky number time! CHEERING We have ?45 for you very lucky people here tonight. If this charming young lady would like to put her hand in the box for the winning ticket, which is... Thank you. The winning number tonight is 0352. 0352. 0352. APPLAUSE Hey, how much money you got? - One and seven. Why? - Stan? - Two bob. - We've got enough for a light ale. - Let's go home. - Why? - How about our fares? - Bill's got enough for us. Am I treating you or something? Yeah. Don't you complain. You're lucky to be out with us. Let's go home. This is luck? Come on. Give us your money. All right, Ginger. We can't go home yet, it's early. Come on. Now we come to the vital part of the evening when Miss Barker says you drew a plan of the garage, and you looked through the window at it, and Coulter told Billy "when you get to the garage, you do as you're told." What was all that about? Well, sir, when we got to the pub, I brought this round of drinks and we all sat down by the window. We could go back to the dance. I... Why don't we see if we can see any gangsters? Eh? Gangsters? They don't wait around street corners for American tourists. What's up with you? It's the heart of the underworld. Barney's right. It was in the News of the World. An ex-superintendent said the bloke next to you could be a copper. It was in the paper, Stan. You're right. Stan. Look up there. - Where? - Those two birds in the window. They've got a record player on. STAN: I bet they've got a lot of drink up there. Big thick carpets and colours on the walls. Kissing and dancing till three in the morning, then leaping into the old bath. Would you like a flat like that for your mum, Stan? A room for her, a separate one for you, a breakfast room. That'd be nice, wouldn't it? I'll draw you one, Stan. We could come and have our Snap, Crackle and Pop with you. You wouldn't have a central light, you'd have "concealed lighting". You'd have brackets on one wall. And the other side is dark. That's what the sparks are putting in where I work. Like this. 'Ere, fellas. Let's go over there and knock on the door. You wouldn't know what to do if one of them answered. I could show you something. I'd have a bath. That's not for the likes of us. That's for the nobs that don't have to get up. You've got to be up at half past six Monday morning. Yeah, I'll be all right. Mum said she'll give me a shake. - Don't worry. - I'm not worried. It's a garage like any other garage. Just do as you're told. I wish I was up there with them birds. Ah, come on, let's go. 'Ere you are, Stan. Hey, my union card. I've lost me union card. Hey! I've lost me union card! I can't find it anywhere. It's all right, they print thousands... I've got to find it. I'll see you. You'd think it was his birth certificate. What then? I found it. I'd dropped it outside the dance hall. I took a tube to the Broadway, then a bus, and I got home about midnight. I put me union card back in me working jeans, and then went to bed. The evening was a total washout. Yes, sir. We should have stayed at home. You've been called hooligans. What have you got to say to that? I don't know, sir. We just behaved natural, but nothing seemed to go right. Thompson, I put it to you that you invented this losing of your union card. Why should I, sir? You've invented this episode of union card. You went with Coulter, Lee and Herne to the Lantern Garage. The reason why you've invented this story is because when you decided what you were going to tell this court, you said to the others, "Your story won't hold up. I'm going to clear myself." That's the truth, isn't it? I don't understand, sir. It's a fabrication, Thompson. A what, sir? You're lying, aren't you? No, sir. I've told the truth. Thank you, Thompson. That's all. Call... I think I'll adjourn the court, Mr Montgomery. - Certainly, m'Lud. - Be upstanding. All persons having anything to do before my Lords the Queen's Justices... PHONE RINGS - Hello. - Victor here. Tom, I'm going through the depositions again, word by word. - I may call you later. - 'Certainly.' Tom, what do you think? We may get a verdict on the knife. No, I mean the boys. Do you think they did it? I believe so. Don't you? I don't know. Anyway, I'd better get on. Bye. PHONE RINGS - Wellbeck 9816. - 'Tom, it's Victor.' Listen. Five and two, seven shillings, four and nine, ten shillings, one pound, that makes ?2, 6s and 11d. - That's what the boys started out with. - Yes. Work out their expenditure for the evening. Every penny counts. They bought crisps. Don't miss a thing. We'll compare notes tomorrow. - Yes, I understand. - Go through the entire brief. Right. Call your next witness, Mr Montgomery. My Lord, I wish to make an application. I'm seeking your Lordship's permission to put further questions to two of the defendants. I know I have a discretion in these matters, but to ask leave to recall a defendant for questioning is surely asking too much, especially in a case of this sort. I have never known such an application. I could only allow it, firstly, if Mr Montgomery consents, and, secondly, if it is made clear to the defendants that none of them need return to the witness box. I would only allow it if they were prepared to return. My Lord, my objective in making this application is because I believe that if your Lordship allows it, this court may be saved a great deal of time. My Lord, I have given this case a great deal of earnest consideration. I will not mislead this court into believing that I am altogether happy with our case. In short, there is much about some of the evidence that has been given by several of my witnesses that I believe to be prejudiced and mistaken. Silence. Silence. M'Lud, with respect to my learned friend, it seems to me the grounds he puts forward suggest that the Crown has already acquitted my clients. That is a question for the jury, Mr Montgomery, as you know. My Lord, if your Lordship grants this application, and if Lee and Coulter are willing to answer further questions, it may well be that I shall consider it my duty not to press these charges further, and to leave it to your Lordship. What do you say, Mr Montgomery? So confident am I of the innocence of my clients, I have no objection, provided they agree. Lee, Coulter. Are you prepared to answer further questions which the prosecution wants to put to you? If you are not, I shall not allow this application. - Yes, sir. - It's all right, sir. Very well then, Mr Webster. Brian Lee, please. Lee, Coulter said in evidence that he gave that when you left the Three Aces public house, "we had a bit of a row, Billy, Barney and me. "It was all about the fares home. Anyway, we got it sorted out." Now, neither you nor Herne have mentioned this row in your evidence. If you had this quarrel, could we hear about it? Go into details for me please. It was a misunderstanding, sir, about how much money we had left. Mmm. Well, how did it proceed? Um... Well, Ginger came flying out the pub, see? My union card! I can't find it anywhere. - It's all right. - I'm going to look for it! Anyone would think he'd lost his birth certificate or something. How much are the fares home then? Eh? How much are fares home? One and a penny. That's nice. I've only got fourpence left. How much have you got? Ninepence. One and a penny, one and tuppence. - Why haven't we got the fares? - It's your adding up. What do you mean? We gave you one and thrupence for them light ales. - How much were they? - One and a penny. Well, then you owe us tuppence each. But we bought them crisps, Stan. I didn't buy crisps! Ginger hasn't given us the change from his round. Marvellous, innit? Never mind. We'll fiddle the bus. "We'll fiddle the bus"! Wait a minute. What's the matter with you? What do you mean? You short of four stinking coppers, are you? Here you are then. You go on home. - Are you having a go? - Let him pick them up, Bill. - Don't you have a go with me. - You be careful. What do you mean? I'll punch your teeth in! Leave off! - Everyone had some crisps! - Shut up! What's the matter with you? Get out of it! I'm telling you, Stan, leave him alone! - So you fiddled the bus? - Yes, sir. We bought ninepennies instead of one and a pennies. Thank you, Lee. Any questions, Mr Montgomery? My Lord, I wish to put further questions to Stanley Coulter. Coulter, this is what you said, wasn't it? "I'd forgotten the fags for my mum and I got them out of this machine and put them by her bed. "Then I went to bed." That's correct, isn't it? You remember doing these things? No doubt about it? No doubt at all, sir. That's all right. I accept that. I'm satisfied as long as you can tell me where you got the money to put into the machine. You see, according to our arithmetic... you didn't have enough money left. Just tell his Lordship where you got the half crown, or two shillings, to put into the machine. I couldn't have gotten them then. I must have got them before. All you had to say, Coulter, was "I didn't know I had the money on me." That's all. Now you've decided to change your story and I'm not at all satisfied, neither are the jury. That half crown was part of the 15 shillings from the Lantern Garage! No, sir. It's no use lying now, Coulter. You went to two pubs and at neither time did you handle the money. If you'd bought them before, you'd have explained to the others. Anyway, on this, the most important recollection of the evening, the memory of buying cigarettes for your mother who was ill in bed, it's impossible you imagined you went to that machine. You said you had no doubt at all that you put the money in! Yes, sir. Now I'll tell you, Coulter, what really happened on the evening of January 15th. Broke and happy to be out, you were determined on a good time, but everyone you met put a damper on it. The last bitter pill to swallow was being short of your fare home. And lurking at the back of your mind was the cigarettes that you'd promised your mother. You didn't plan to rob this garage until a few minutes before the crime was committed. You didn't plan to kill anybody, but you did! Brutally! All of you! Ruthlessly! No, sir. Which one did it, Coulter? Who held the knife? I think it was young Billy. Young Billy. Your friend. The daredevil, the tearaway. He held the knife. He did it. A kid of 16 who idolised you. He didn't do it, sir. How did it happen, Coulter? We... We... We was fighting and... fighting. Leave him alone! Stay out of it, Bill. You're always the same, Stan. Cut it out! What's the matter with you? What are we fighting for? A blinking shilling! Look at him! We don't have to walk home! We shouldn't be crawling in the gutter! We should go home in a taxi! We're skint! Well, we'll get some money. Where? I know where we can get some money. I know where we can get a 100 quid! No, straight up! We can get ?100! What's the matter with you? Don't you want to go out on the town? Don't you want any birds? What's the matter? You cowards? All right, you walk home! I'll go out on me jack! I'll go out and have a dance and a nosh-up and all the birds on me jack! Marvellous, you are! Billy's out front, Barney's on the corner, and this copper comes along. Billy gets so scared, he can't move. Barney's seen the copper and he walks past the door, only I can't get out 'cause this copper's there. Then this car comes up and this geezer's coming through, and he's going to turn the light on... Copper's going to see the door's busted. And I'm stuck there. I've got this knife in my hand. You killed him, Coulter? My Lord, I must ask for a brief adjournment. Granted, Mr Montgomery. The court will adjourn for as long as you please. ... murdered Arthur Walter Baxter in the course of theft. Stanley Herbert Coulter, how say you? Are you guilty or not guilty? Guilty, sir. Brian Harold Lee, how say you? Are you guilty or not guilty? Guilty, sir. William Henry Herne, how say you? Are you guilty or not guilty? Guilty, sir. James Alan Thompson, how say you? Are you guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. M'Lud, I don't know whether my learned friend has any observations to make in respect of Thompson. The crown will not press for a conviction in Thompson's case. Your Lordship may see fit to adopt a certain course. Members of the jury, you've all heard and seen what has happened this morning, you've all heard and seen what has happened this morning, and I'm sure there can be no doubt in any of your minds that Thompson had no part in this crime. I am quite satisfied in my own mind there is no evidence on which any jury could convict him. I direct you to bring a verdict of not guilty. Members of the jury, on the direction of his Lordship, do you find James Alan Thompson not guilty? We do. Very well. James Alan Thompson, you are discharged. You may go. Members of the jury, you have heard how the other defendants now plead, but they are in your charge and I direct you to return a verdict of guilty. On the direction of his Lordship, do you find Brian Harold Lee, Stanley Herbert Coulter and William Henry Herne guilty? We do. My Lord, in view of the extraordinary circumstances, may I make a few observations before sentence is passed? Certainly, Mr Montgomery. My Lord, I don't wish for one moment to minimise the enormity of the crime. An old man... An old man. My Lord, I could say that any four boys, given the circumstances that involved my client, might have done this dreadful senseless thing. That any four boys, consistently condemned by social and economic background, by their fellow citizens, by their very appearance, took the inevitable next step, indulged in petty robbery. That this was a petty crime, and that the killing was as foreign to their nature as the killing of a bird or a cat. I could say that these were no more than boys trying to have an evening out. I passionately believe this to be true, my Lord. At the same time I could say, while we must not forget for one moment that a man has been brutally killed and a family has been bereaved, some of our concerns should be with the other victims, the guilty ones. My Lord, I have no right to say these things because I know that the law proscribes one penalty for my clients. Today this court must hear a sentence of death, and nothing I can say can alter that. Because my clients did not kill Mr Baxter for pleasure or in anger, or for revenge. Had they done so, the law would have said imprison them. They killed for gain. For gain, the law says kill. My Lord, this law is in need of a counsel. It stands accused, this law, particularly in this case. It's in need of an eloquent defence. It needs a bold counsel to come into court now and plead on its behalf. So who will plead for the law, my Lord? Who will dare? Brian Harold Lee and William Henry Herne, stand up. Prisoners at the bar, you both stand convicted of felony. Have you anything to say why the court should not give you judgment according to the law? No, sir. Both of you, together with Coulter, quite clearly were acting in concert with the intention of robbing from the garage this night. Equally clearly, both of you knew that Coulter had a knife, and that he had the knife on him when he entered the garage. You had as much a part in the killing as you had in the theft. That you ran away and were not present when the blow was struck proves only that you were prepared to do anything to save your own skins. You, Herne, are 16, and you, Lee, 17 years of age. The law proscribes that no person shall suffer death as a penalty if he be under the age of 18 years. Therefore, the sentence of this court is that you be detained until Her Majesty's pleasure be known. Stanley Herbert Coulter, stand up. Prisoner at the bar, you stand convicted of felony. Have you any reason, why the court should not give judgement according to the law? It is impossible for me not to comment on the several acts of savagery to which you have admitted. The wanton lawlessness, the contemptuous and reckless disregard for public property, and, finally, this bestial attack upon an old man. You broke into the garage, Coulter, while your friends kept watch. You had in your hand an offensive and dangerous weapon. You used this weapon, not once, but six times upon this poor man. You silenced him because he would have given you away. But even then, the dreadful crime committed, with the full horror of it before your eyes, even then you remembered the small change in the cash box. No ?100, but 15 shillings. And even then, you made away with that. You were given many opportunities of confessing to your terrible crime, but you and your friends kept this a secret until the learned counsel for the prosecution prised it out of you. Stanley Herbert Coulter, you have pleaded guilty to capital murder - a murder committed for gain - and, as such, the law provides but one sentence. Stanley Herbert Coulter, the sentence of this court upon you is that you suffer death in the manner authorised by law, and may God have mercy on your soul. Amen. Be upstanding. All persons having anything further to do with my Lords the Queen's Justices, and the general jurisdiction of the central criminal court, may depart hence and give their attendance here tomorrow at 10.30 o'clock. God save the Queen.
