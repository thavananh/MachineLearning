foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- (funky music) - It's time. Pay the man, Ruben. (funky music) What the hell's goin' on? - Lenny, can't you read the sign? - What sign? He's goin' out of business. That's the way it is. They bought him out. Can't even buy a paper. Whatever happened to the newspaper? - Bought him out? Who bought him out? - Take your pick, it doesn't matter. That's what I'm talking about. Survival of the fittest. It's tough, it's tough out there. They eat you for a snack. They want you, they eat you. That's how it is. I'll tell you why. 'Cause nobody cares for nobody. It ain't exactly front page, but, it's getting crueler. Can you feel it? - We almost there? - [Lenny] It's comin'. (horn honks) (yelling in foreign language) - [Ruben] What the hell are you doing? - He wants to run me over? I'll make it easy. (car horns honking) What the hell's the matter with you? Who do you think you are anyway? Take a shot, you bloodthirsty animal. - Let's go. Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go. Shut up, get out of the way. - You saved my life. I'd like to save your life. If law school doesn't pan out, I'll be a doctor. - I'll dock ya. - First, I'm gonna sue that one, and then I'm gonna save your life. Come on, I want a coffee. Black coffee. You gotta start somewhere. You help others, you help yourself. And that's the truest truth. - That juice didn't help my stomach, and neither did your platitudes. - What do you know? I'll tell you what I know. This is good coffee. I love coffee. Coffee tastes good. I realized that a long time ago, and I'm realizing it again. Only now it's better. And there's no denyin' it. - It's wonderful, Lenny. - Lenny, did you see what Glow Tech did yesterday? - Glow Tech? Who? - Glow Tech jumped ten points and split. I hope you did my advice. - Sure, I always take your advice, Joey. - Here's another one. Anta-mix. Yeah, it's a good buy. I know of what I speak. - Sure, Joey. How are you doin'? - Angst is how I am. That is the trouble with me. I got angst. You know. Listen Lenny, I hate to trouble ya. - Oh sure, Joey. Yeah. We're runnin' late. Give 'im a couple of bucks, all right Ruby? Okay, and... - [Ruby] All I got's twenties. - [Lenny] Do you have change for a 20, miss? - [Woman] Sorry. - [Lenny] Sir. Excuse me, do you... Uh, gentleman, so would you mind change... Here you go, kid. Here you go. - What's this? - Come on, don't you love New York? - [Ruben] You shouldn't have done that. - Good for your karma. - It isn't karma. - Now you'll come back as a Rockefeller. - That has nothing to do with karma. The difference is... - Oh don't start explaining to me about transmigration of souls. Or reincarnation, so help me Ruben. - I'm not a bank machine. - If you're worried about lunch, stop it right now. Lunch is not a problem. Come on, we're late. This is what I'm talking about. Look at this. You wanna give me an investment? Give me a public company that does scaffolding. That's an investment. Goddamn scaffolding's taking over the city. - I don't think scaffolding's publicly traded. - You know something? I'm serious about coffee. Coffee, I'm better with it. Without coffee I've got nothing going for me. - [Ruben] Yeah, but your heart. - What about my heart? I've been asleep for six months with herbal tea. What's the point? Coffee makes all the difference in the world. Let me tell you something. Before I gave up coffee, there was a lot. There was a lot. Believe me. There was a lot, believe me. Oh damn. Son of a bitch. This is what I'm talking about. What are you waiting for? Don't you wanna meet her? Keep walking. - [Ruben] What do you mean keep walking? - Keep walking, don't look. I said don't look. What is that? - You looked. - Yeah, I looked. I looked, but the both of us standing there like a couple of idiots. You ruined it. - Did you see her? - [Lenny] No, I couldn't see anything. Did you see her? - How do I know if I saw her? - Did you see the most beautiful creature on God's green earth? [Lenny] No. - Then you didn't see her. - Now what? - Her appointment is at ten. It's 10:15, she's in there. - [Ruben] 10:20. - Your watch is fast. - Yours is slow. - You're always fast, and you always forget. You're too young to forget. Why don't you remember? - Ten o'clock you say? - For three weeks since I spied her, she's been here at ten on Tuesday's, and then she hops the bus to Sachs. - And meanwhile? - [Lenny] We wait. - We're poking out like a sore thumb. How about there? - I don't frequent those places. - [Ruben] What places? - There's no table service. - Table service, that's a good one. He wants table service to discuss his latest infatuation. - Infatuation? Infatuation sounds lascivious. That's not me. I'm respectful, I'm cordial. Dignified. Wouldn't you say? Ruben? - I'd say terrifying. - Not what I'm looking for. - Is that her? - No. Her I would not be terrified. Besides, she's not my type. This one, the one we're waiting for is special. She reminds me of Ester. - [Ruben] Lenny. - What time is it? - 11:15. 11:10 according to your watch. - It's 11:12. - [Waitress] There you go. - You're not from here. - No. - Upstate then? Where you from? - [Waitress] Washington state. - That's, that's a beautiful place. I've never been there. - He never been anywhere. (laughing) - Italy, and Jersey, when I was ten, but I remember everything. That's a beautiful place. - Well, this is a beautiful place too. - You make it more beautiful. - Oh, thank you. - And you say you can't talk to a pretty girl. What do you call that? - That one, she's a kiss. I always liked the waitress. That's why I like the table service. No table service, no waitress. That's what I'm talking about. They approach you, they smile, they talk to you, they bring you food. I always like the waitress. - Hey, my wife's getting a raise. Big one. Big position change for her over there. - Good. Good for you. Good for your wife. Let me ask you something. Why do you call her your wife? Her name is Marcy. The way you say, my wife, it's as though you're discovering for the first time... - She is my wife. - A man who has been married 25 years talking to his lifelong friend shouldn't call his wife his wife. He should call her by her first name, which in this case is Marcy. Now, if you were divorced, had a wife and an ex-wife, then I could understand the differentiation between the wife and the ex-wife, but even then I think it would be more natural for you to call them by their first names. What kind of money are we talking about? - I don't know. She thinks maybe close as twice as much as what she's making now. - Very interesting woman, your wife. - Now what does that mean? - It means you should leave her. - Is that her? - Of course not. - You got something on your face. - What? - I don't know what. Here, let me. - [Lenny] What is it? - I don't know. Cake? - I was not eating cake. - It looks like cake. - My face is turning to cake. I can't do this, my face is falling off. - Oh, you look fine. - Who do I think I am? - You're Lenny, a fine looking gentleman. You know, handsome. - Fine? What is this fine? I can't do this. I, I... - [Ruben] Sure you can. - No, no, you're not the one who's face is falling off. - You look good. You're a handsome, a handsome man. - [Lenny] Oh, shut up. - Lenny. - And do me a favor and do something. Anything please. - [Ruben] Like what? - That's it. Forget about it. Forget about the whole damn thing. I'm leaving. I'm going. - [Ruben] No, no. I'm sorry. - [Lenny] What are you sorry about? This is, this is a rotten idea, all right. Let me go! (dramatic music) - The problem with this city is it doesn't have any respect for itself. Little creature comforts. Name a creature comfort. There, you see. You can't. It's a hard city. Streets are hard, buildings are hard. What's not hard about it? Tell me. It's the land of the rich now, starting to get out. - Everyone's already gone. - Yeah, if they're right, they're right to get out. - I'll never leave. - Yeah, when you're younger, you know, when you're a young man it's different. But now you're not so young. - You're talking about me? Or are you talking about yourself? - Talking about both of us. You know, we can leave. We could go. - So leave. - I'm just talkin'. - Yeah, you're just talking. You're talking about nothing. If I wanna hear talking about nothing, I can watch the television. - Talking about retirement. - From what? 15 years of unemployment? I know, you'll get a job. - Aren't you tired, Lenny? I mean, you gotta retire sometime. - Retire? You me slacking on seventh avenue? I retired a lifetime ago. I could never afford it again. - I'm talkin' about gettin' out of here. Relaxing someplace else. Both of us. - You're out of your mind. - Together. (laughing) Oh, just stop it. Stop it, Lenny. - Oh, that's, that's... Retire. He wants to retire. If that's what you wanna do, Ruby, by all means. But all I got's tied up in the market. Without retirement money, that's money I gotta finesse. There's no retirement in my future. God willing I'll drop dead tomorrow, and still have a roof over my head. - [Ruben] Marcy's doing very well. - What, Marcy again? Good for her. - You know, she could come too. We could all of us retire. But you know, she doesn't have to know. - Doesn't have to know? What does that mean? Ruben, I'm sorry. Ruben, my friend, my dear friend, Marcy, who you like to call your wife, who hasn't been faithful to you for over 25 years. What makes you think that she'll wanna give up her flourishing career and stable her gentleman suitors, to sit on a golf course with her deadbeat husband and his single corrupting influence? The only reason you're still married, is she's a Catholic, and you're a frightened little man. - Oh yeah? A frightened little man whose wife pays your way. - [Lenny] Oh, get out of my sight. - Oh, you can close your eyes, Lenny, but it's still the truth. - Who's closing his eyes? Look at you. You're a shivering mouse with an allowance. You're not a man, Lenny. Lenny, she's destroying me. Ruben, your marriage with your wife is dead. Over. You wanna leave? Leave. This hasn't got anything to do with me or retirement or anything other than fear. Fear is the only thing keeping you from living. Look, an omen. Tell her it's from me. For all the help. Retiring with an old man is not an option, Ruben. Not for you and not for me neither. - [Ruben] Hi hi. - What do you want, Lenny? - Is that anyway? What is that? How about, Hi Lenny, I haven't seen you in a while. What's new? You're looking sharp. How about something along those lines? - Sharp? - Forget it. Half a pint of water in a pint glass. - What? - Half a pint of water in a pint glass. - You do look sharp, Lenny. - [Lenny] Thank you very much, Pearl. - Oh Lenny, how are ya? - I'm great. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, Molly. And a beer. - What do you think you're doing? - What am I doing? I'm brightening up the place, that's all. I'm trying to make an impression here. - [Pearl] Oh, he's so sweet. - [Molly] Yeah, he's sweet, isn't he? - You hear that? I'm sweet. Thanks. I'm sweet, but I'm also a little short today, Connie, and uh, I promised Ruby here a little lunch. Can I get ya next week? - It's all right, Lenny. I'll get it. - You're beautiful when you smile. (giggling) Thank you. - What about you? - I lost my appetite. (uplifting music) - I don't go in there. - What? - That place, that café. It's not for me. There's a better café around the corner. Nice suit. - Yeah? - [Woman] I don't like that place. - No. - Snooty. - Yeah. I don't usually go in there. - No, I don't suppose so. It's not for you either. - No. - Are you all right? - What's all right? - The day. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? - The day. - [Woman] Yes. It's beautiful. (gentle music) - Open the door, please. Let me out. (gentle music) I saw you, didn't you see me? - What? - Through the window, I waved. Didn't you see me? - Yes, uh, no. - Well, I was out there, and I saw you in here, so I thought I'd say hello. - Well? - Hello. The truth is I was thinking that if you were interested that maybe sometime we could have something. A drink, a bite or something along those lines. You know, if there was any interest that is. Why is that funny? - No, I smiled. - Oh, well, that's, that's okay. - Yeah. - A smile is good then. So uh... - No, I was just about... - Oh. - No, no no no. No, I was waiting for somebody. - Oh, then if... May I take your number? (laughing) It's funny again. - No. It's just it's been a long time since anybody asked for my number. - I don't see a ring on your finger. - Why don't I take your number? - Oh, I mean if you don't wanna take my number I perfectly understand. - No, it's better if I take your number. - It is? Oh. Okay, then if it is, it is. The thing is, it's a Brooklyn number. - That's fine. - Good, okay. Oh, thanks. (chuckles) Lenny's my name. Lenny Sugarman. - Maura Hotchkiss, Mimi for short. - Call me Lenny. - [Mimi] It's a deal. - What is? - Nothing, it's just a joke. - Okay, good. Okay, so... - So? - I guess then that's it. - Yes, Lenny. Goodbye. - Goodbye Mimi Hotchkiss. (chuckling) (laughing) - That ins't correct. No. Did you tell him who it's for? And call them back, make sure it's Marcel or Ida, or Casper. Or Ivan, and tell them Zac Sugarman wants his table. There's no if. And I still don't like what Horopa's doing with my callers. Don't, don't make a big deal of it, but I shouldn't have to tell you twice. Honey, (chuckles), honey, you're my pit man. I love you too. - What is that? - What's what? - [Lenny] Oh your head. - It's a hat. - You don't wear a hat like that at a place of business. Unless you're a ball player. Are you a ball player? - Uncle Lenny, I have to talk to you. - I wanna talk to you too, but not with that hat. Off, take it off. - Take a seat, Uncle Lenny. - I don't wanna sit, do you know why? - [Zac] No. - Because today, not like other days, Zachery. Today's a special day. - Uncle Lenny. - Today I met the most amazing girl in New York city. - I really... - I mean the kind they don't make anymore. This isn't nothing. I'm talking about an elegant lady. - [Zac] Lenny. - Don't interrupt. - I don't have time. - I'm trying to teach you something. This is about love. Love, Zachery, is more important than all of it put together. - Okay, we have to talk. - And if you'd listen, you'd learn, and to learn you must listen. - No, you listen to me. That's right. You just listen. - [Lenny] You don't talk to your elders that way. - Well, I'm sorry, but this is important. - [Lenny] What? What is it? I mean... Nothing is as important as respect or maybe love. - And with all due respect, uncle Lenny, and with love, please sit down, and let me tell you something. - What? What is it? Is something wrong? Are you sick? You're not sick? - No. - Then what is it? - Lenny, are you calm? - Yes, I'm calm. What is it already? - Lenny... You're broke. - [Lenny] What do you mean I'm broke? - [Zac] The pork bellies. - What about the pork bellies? - It went up in flames. - Okay, but diversify. - Filed Chapter 11. - What? - [Zac] I always told you. - What about the gruda? - Time's up on Gruda. I had to sell it off with the scraps from the commodities. There's nothing left. - But Gruda's supposed to drop. It's going to drop. - [Zac] It's too late. - No, I heard it from a very reliable source that there's an investigation, and the bottom is gonna fall out. - It doesn't matter, Lenny, it's not yours anymore. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about the same thing I've been talking about for ten years. - [Lenny] What the hell does that mean? - It means you can't draw anymore income from your investments, uncle Lenny. Your investments are gone. It's over. - You can't do this. - I tried to tell you. I warned you. It's not vegas. I'm not a bookie. For years, I begged you to stop the shorting. You never knew what you were doing. My father always said... - Oh, your father never did anything. He couldn't wipe his own ass. - [Zac] No, that's not true. - No, now don't you interrupt me. How dare you? Rude, and undisciplined, just like your father. - He said... - He what? Who paid for your braces? You're damn right. I did. Your father didn't have enough money for his own son's teeth. - [Zac] He had a... - He what? He what? He pissed it away on hookers, and you know it. So don't... Don't. (sobbing) Oh, Ester. God rest her soul. Good God, Zachery. You don't know how I love that woman. Your mother deserved better. - Here's about 5,000 dollars from a CD I started a few years ago. I couldn't watch you lose everything. I'm sorry. - Sorry? What is that? I need to live. - I'm sorry. - I need to live, and you're sorry. You're supposed to be looking out for me. - Maybe I can help you. I can give you an allowance. A payment. Every week. (laughing) Don't do that. Don't... (yelling) Don't do that. You know, I have a meeting. I... We should talk about this more. - I would never take a dime from you. Who do you think you are talking to me that way? You think you're special? You're something special? I have news for you. If you can sit in here with your baseball cap and call yourself a broker, anyone can. - Okay. I don't have time. - Who's, who's the big shot? Who's the big shot now? - Come back, we'll talk more about this. - [Lenny] Get out of my sight. - [Zac] You're in my office. - [Lenny] Get out. - [Zac] All right, lock the door when you leave. (gentle music) (knocking) - [Ruben] Lenny, it's three o'clock in the afternoon. I'm not fooling around. Lenny, Lenny. Answer the door. Lenny. Lenny, open the goddamn door. (knocking) Lenny, if I call the coroner and you're still alive, there's gonna be a lot of embarrassment. Jesus Christ. You nearly gave me a heart attack. - [Lenny] I'm sorry. - [Ruben] What's the idea? Where have you been? Where you been? - [Lenny] Right here. - [Ruben] Well, why weren't you at Eisenberg's? - [Lenny] I'm sorry. - Again, you're sorry. - [Lenny] I forgot. - We've had breakfast every morning for 15 years. What do you mean you forgot? - [Lenny] I forgot. - Why didn't you answer your phone? - [Lenny] I didn't hear it. - You didn't hear it? First your memory, now your hearing. What's going on? - [Lenny] I'm tired. - You can be tired, I was... I was worried. I was afraid that something happened. - [Lenny] Nothing happened. - You know, you don't look so good. When you due at the doctor? - [Lenny] I'm not. - You're not? Oh yes, you are. I'm calling that doctor of yours. Where's your address book? - [Lenny] No, no. I'm fine. - [Ruben] Yeah, you're not fine. This isn't like you. Here it is. Dr. Kanya. - [Lenny] I said I'm fine! - [Ruben] Okay, okay, I was worried. - [Lenny] Get out of here, will you? - Okay Jesus. I'm sorry. You gonna be at breakfast tomorrow? - Yes. (knocking) - [Ruben] Here. - I don't need it. - [Ruben] Why? - I'm flushed, I'll explain later. - [Ruben] Take the money. - I don't need it. Get out. (gentle music) - [Server] Where's the troublemaker? (phone ringing) - Hello. - Lenny? Oh, Jesus, Lenny, I've been trying you all day. - Where are ya? - You don't answer the door, you don't answer the phone. You need help, Lenny. Why don't you let me come over? - Where are you now? - [Ruben] Why does that matter where I'm at? - Just go home. - What about the doctor? - I went. - [Ruben] You did? Did ya? - I just said I did. - Well, what'd he say? - He said stay home. - [Ruben] What's wrong with you? - He said stay off the phone. - [Ruben] What? - [Lenny] I might be going away for awhile. I need rest. - What? Well, where you goin'? - Ruben, go home. - Lenny, Lenny. Lenny. (phone ringing) (phone beeping) Hey, hey you. - [Zac] I don't have any change. - I do. - It's me, it's Ruben. - Uncle Ruben? - That's your uncle? - No, not really. Look, it's not my fault. - What's not your fault? - Yeah, what's not your fault? - I told that old man for years. For years I told him. - For what? - Nothing, nothing. Is he okay? - You're asking me? You saw him last. What happened? - Ask him. - Ask him what? - Tell him I'm sorry, tell him not to do anything, he can talk to me. Tell him to call me. I can help. - We're gonna be late. - All right, I have to go. - Who is that? - No one. My uncle, his friend. - Zachery. - You know what? Take this. Call me if anything happens. - Hey, yo. (gentle music) (lively music) (phone ringing) - Hello. This is Lenny. Yes. Yes. Yes? Mimi? Oh, oh my. Oh my God, Mimi. Yes, you... You caught me at a time... Oh, what a time. No, no no. Yes. Yes. No, no it's okay. It's fine. It's wonderful. It's wonderful that you called. It is. No, no no. Let's, let's meet. Let's meet right now. Yes, now, right away. No. Tonight? Oh, all right. Then you name it. Friday? - [Voiceover] Lenny, Lenny it's me. - What is, what is? It's what. Friday then, yes. Friday yes. Friday night. Okay. - Lenny. - Friday night. I'll see you at eight. - Oh my God. What are you doin'? - She's your neighbor. - What? - My date. Mimi. The girl I was telling you about. Come on. Let's celebrate. - A suit? What are you talking about? - I'm talking about a suit. What do you think I'm talking about? You gotta make an impression. See, even when a person with as fine a quality as Mimi, an impression is the first thing. The most important thing. - Oh, for Christ sake, Lenny. You've been walking around in the same suit for 20 years. - That's what I'm talking about. - You don't have money for a bus fare, for a sandwich, for a cup of coffee, you're short the end of every month, you're short. So how do you justify spending... What is it? - 1,100. - 1,100 dollars on a... - It's what's the style. - Feels great, you know that. It's beautiful. It's beautiful, Lou. Isn't it a beauty, Rube? Rube? - [Ruben] Yeah. - I tell ya, it makes all the difference in the world. - [Tailor] 1,100 dollars is 1,100 dollars. That's all I can do. I'm not kidding. - I know you're not kidding. It's a fair price for something that makes you feel like a million. - Button the top. - You should get one, Rube. You know that? I'm telling ya. You heard of Alexander the Great? Meet Lenny the conqueror. What's with this place? Where is everybody? Why is it so dead? It's dead in here. - We're closing is what. Some intercom what not, I don't know. They're moving in. They bought the lease. Enough of this crap. I'm moving to North Carolina. Lift your arms. - North Carolina, you see. - What are you doing in North Carolina? - Sleeping. - That's right. Plenty of rest. - Those idiots. You wouldn't believe what they gave me for the lease. My front yard's the beach, my backyard's the tenth hole. (laughing) - [Ruben] Well since you're sitting pretty, how about a break on the suit? - I'm giving you a break. You wanna break? How about your legs? You should be more appreciative. - It's not my suit. - That's right. It's not your suit. It's Lenny's. And he's not flinching. Where does somebody like you get 1,100 dollars for a suit? It's not for your funeral is it? - Lou, I've known you a long time. So I know I could understand how you, how you could ask such a question. The truth of the matter is, I've had some success in the market. - A broker, Lenny? Since? I mean, how could you tell him that a broker... - I told him what I told him for a reason. - But you're not a broker, Lenny, for God sakes. - It's about confidence. I realize now it's all about confidence. It doesn't have anything to do with anything else. You are what you are at any moment, according to your confidence. - Do you know what a confidence man is, Lenny? - I don't know why I never saw it before. If I had, I could have saved myself a lot of misery. Did you see the way he changed his tune when I told him what was what? It's about impressions. - But you're not a broker. - Watch me. I am what I say I am. A week is a week. A month is a month. What difference does it matter when I did it. The point is I did it, it's done, and I'm opening a shingle. I'm out. I'm through with the middle man. I'm hungry, and I'm eating. - You're soliciting me. You come in here, you lay down cash for the big shot shoes, and you think you can manhandle me? The two of you? - I'm not any part of this. - You're absolutely wrong. But you're absolutely right about one thing. This is a solicitation. And if it is solicitous for me to come in here, and peddle my, what is it, an offer of good will and fortune, then that's what it is. Can I help it if a little good fortune has come my way? I wanna spread it around. I want my joy to be for others. - Ask him to see the license. - What license? - For brokerage. - I'm comfortable with the certificate of deposit. At least I know what it is. - If you wanna sleep while the rest of us are cooking, that's your business. But while you're in here snoozing, I'm talking about 28 percent a year for the last five years. That's money I'm talking about. Not crackers. - Where do you come up with 28 percent? - I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm talking about. That's the figure. - I can't sit idly by while you do this. - Do what? - You're a crazy person. What figures? You can't tell that to people. - People? Who? What? - Things, people. - These are the most comfortable shoes. - I mean it. I do. Look, it's not right. It's gonna come back on ya. - What if it's my destiny? You're the one always talking about destiny. What if these, the last fruitful days of my life were squandered waiting for death's door. Is that what you're suggesting I do? My whole life, Ruben. I felt there was something. Some reason I was here. Something, some purpose. And since I met this girl, this Mimi, I've been figuring it out, and then she called. And everything's perfectly clear. Ruben, I never felt more clear in my life. I feel alive. - A cup of coffee makes you feel alive. It's a moment, a passing moment. How are you gonna look at these guys tomorrow? - I deserve it, don't I? If some crook can lounge his whole life and collect the rent, then don't I deserve it? - [Ruben] Deserve what, Lenny? - You worked hard your whole life, I know you have. Think of it as a reward you're giving yourself. With all due respect, Sal, in two years, in five years, what do we have left? With that kind of compounding, your children, their children, God bless 'em, won't be in the kind of shape we suffered in. - I don't have children. - The point is you gotta keep the blood pumping to keep the heart pounding. - It's a lot of money. - What are you doing, Lenny? Let's get out of here. - It's called business. I'm buying socks here. - I don't know, Lenny. - Which is exactly my point. You don't know. But luckily I do. It's up to you. I don't have any cause left, but you know how to reach me. - [Sal] Yeah. - Cards? What cards? You can't just, you're over board, Lenny. You're going right over. We're not talking De-near fights here, Lenny. I'm sure the Weiss' are well schooled in the ways of the market. - Not really. - Of course we are. - This plant kicks the crap out of that piddling, municipal bond garbage the big frims try to sell you. And letting your money sit in a checking account, is like leaving it out in the rain for the birds. - So, how much would we have to give you? - [Lenny] That's up to you. - We don't have much. We're not rich people. - No, no. Of course not. It's whatever you're comfortable with. - [Miriam] What do you think, Mo? - Well, if you think this is a good idea... - These are gorgeous. Rube, aren't they gorgeous? - We've known Lenny a long time and it sounds like a good idea. - [Lenny] It's an option. - I think we should do it. How about we start with 10,000 dollars? - Lenny, please. - [Miriam] It's too much? - Maybe, we should think about this. Take our time. - [Lenny] Sure. - I'm sure if Lenny says it's... - Think about it all you like. It's a good idea in fact. - Yeah, you see that? - Good. You should be comfortable. These are beautiful. I'll take 'em. - We start at 5,000 dollars. Okay Lenny? - Okay. - Okay dear? - Well, if that's what you want. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Let me treat you to a haircut. Ruben? C'mon Ruben, you can use a shave at least. Frank, give him a shave. Put it on me. You want your pickle? You want the pickle or don't you want the pickle? That's a very simple question. - [Ruben] You can have it. - I'm gonna take it. And there's gonna be no further discussion. That'll be that, and I don't wanna hear another word about it. Is that all right? That's a good pickle. - I love the pickles, but, you want it. - Very nice, thank you. - That's a lot of money there. - [Lenny] Yeah. Right. - So? - [Lenny] So what? - So you're a broker now? - Yeah, right. - [Ruben] With an imaginary licence? - What's imaginary? - I ran into your nephew. I ran into him right before I came running over to your house and saw that... I saw what was hanging from your ceiling, Lenny. Now, Zac says he can help. He said you should talk to him. He's your only blood. - [Lenny] He's his father's son. - He has nothing to do with his father marrying your Ester. - He should be indicted. - [Ruben] He said... - I'm not interested in what he said. - You're not a broker, Lenny. What you're doing is illegal. - [Lenny] I'm not a broker and he is? - He said he would help you. - Help me? I don't need any help. You think I can't do this? I'll make them their money, so help me God. Don't undermine my confidence, Ruben. That's not a friend. That's the worst thing you could do. - [Ruben] Sit, sit. We'll get some more pickles. - I lost my appetite. (lively music) (lively music) - Lenny. - Oh, hello. - Hello. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. Oh. They're lovely. - Thank you, and oh... May I? - Well, yes, please, of course. - Like it? - Yes, I do. (laughing) - Don't you like chocolates? - No, yes, I do, I like them very much. It's like Christmas. - [Lenny] You don't have to take them. - No, no no. I, I wanna take them. - [Lenny] Oh good. - Oh wait. Give it to me. - What are you doing? - Well, I didn't bring a vase and we're having supper, right? - Oh, okay. Should I carry it? - Well, no, I don't want you to get stuck with a bag again. - What does that mean? - Nothing. - [Lenny] I'm funny. - Yes. - [Lenny] Yes. Good funny? - Yes. - As long as it's good. You hungry? - Yes. - That's three yeses. That's gotta be good. (gentle jazz music) Are you a coffee drinker? - [Mimi] Sometimes. Sometimes tea. Mostly tea. Why? - [Lenny] I didn't have any coffee today. - [Mimi] And you usually do? - [Lenny] Yeah, sometimes. I should have had some today. - [Mimi] Why? - I don't know, I'm just talking. This use to be one hell of a place for a steak. - I was in buy. I bought for all the old department stores. Aldman's, Gimbal's. I sent them out of business, but it was fun. I went to Milan, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong. - I was in Italy once. - I love Italy. I've always wanted to live there. - I remember it all. - What do you remember? - I remember I was a child, I remember it was beautiful. The lakes, the fields, the ocean. I remember everything. - Why were you there? - We went back, my father and I, had to look for my mother. Before the war I don't remember. - [Mimi] I thought you remembered everything. - I do. - No, thanks. And you've never been back? - I'll never leave New York. - [Mimi] Just to visit. - No. What would I do there? - It's beautiful. - Naw. It is, but no. - Do you remember your mother? - I've never been married, you know? - No, I didn't. - Not that I didn't intend to, but I never found the right girl. If you been married, that doesn't matter to me, it's, that's your business. (laughing) I don't know why I brought it up. I wanna say that I really appreciate that you, you are going out with me like this. - Like what? - [Lenny] Like we're on a date. - That's a beautiful suit, Lenny. - Oh, it's new. I got it for you actually. For tonight. - [Mimi] You didn't. - Yeah. Boy, did I. - What do you do, Lenny? - Ah-ha, that's funny. It's a good question. I'm nothing. The truth is I've done nothing with my life. - [Mimi] I'm sure that's not true. - It is, that's what's so awful. - [Mimi] You're just feeling glum. I'm sorry about your mother. - My mother had nothing to do with it. I'm out with the most beautiful woman in the world, and I'm talking about my mother. - It's all right. - You're never going to go out with me again. (laughing) - [Mimi] Not true. - [Lenny] I'm being funny again? - Yes. - You're just nervous because you don't know how you're gonna get out of this. - [Mimi] Stop it. - Why don't you just get up and get out of here? - [Mimi] Because I'm having a nice time. - How could you possibly be having a nice time? - Because you're telling me something, the truth, or trying to. That's rare. I'm flattered. - You're a knockout, you know that? You know that, don't you? - No. Let's just have a nice time. - [Lenny] I'm having a wonderful time. (gentle music) - [Mimi] Thank you. - So, this is it. This is where I found you. - This is our corner. - Not a very remarkable corner. - Nope. But it's ours. - Let me walk you home. Oh. - I'll walk myself home. - All right. If this is a first date, when will our second date be? - Soon. - Soon? - [Mimi] Mm-hmm. - What kind of an answer is soon? When will the world end? Soon. That's what soon is, it's nothing. That's what I'm talking about. That's soon. I'll see you then. - Goodbye, Lenny. (gentle jazz music) - Goodbye, darling. I was in the neighborhood. I can come back another time, or... - No, no. - May I? - Yes, please. I'm glad you came. - [Lenny] I wanted to... - Leave it. - I wanted, I wanted, really what I wanted was to... You said you could help me. - Yes. Good. - Because, I was thinking about our conversation. I mean, about some of the funds. The ones you talked about in the past that admittedly I was less than enthusiastic about. I mean, the mutual funds, the money market funds, the other funds, that which I don't remember, but first and foremost, I was wondering if someone wanted to suddenly, say, invest or to do some business, or to take some or all of your advice, how would one come to reach some kind... - What do you mean? - I want to do what you're telling me. To do what you been telling me all along. But first I thought some kind of, a high gain equity. Only for a short time. To boost my capital. - No, no. - And then we'd... And then we go to the safe route. The Zac Sugarman route. That's what I was thinking. - What am I gonna do with you? - [Lenny] And I was really thinking that... - I can help you, but not like that. - [Lenny] Then? - I can supplement your social security. - [Lenny] Yes? - I can set up an account from which you can draw... - [Lenny] Any investments? - No, no. I'm not taking anymore investments. Let me help you. - Well, that's what I'm here for. - I can set up some sort of an account from which you can draw call it a monthly stipend if that's what you wanna call it. - I don't take charity. - It's not charity, it's what people do. It's what families do. - [Lenny] Families? - Well, you may not like it, but, you are my family. - I don't wanna hear it. - Then I can't help you. - But listen. - [Zac] No, I can't. - [Lenny] It's just for a few weeks. - No. If you change, come back. I mean it. But I'm done playing this game. All right, this game is over. We do it my way or no way. And I don't mean to be rude or disrespectful, Uncle Lenny, but, I want you out of here right now. (gentle jazz music) - Anta-mintz. Remember what I said? Remember what I said? I hope you were smart. Gotta heed the cree, Lenny. Heed the cree. So, jumped eight points. Are ya rich? - Jerry. - What? What did I say? What did I say? it's a bargain, right? - What about scaffolding? - Scaffolding? - Yeah, who's got scaffolding? - I don't know who's scaffolding. Angst is what I got. Angst I know from. Angst and hunger. - Sure, Joey. Here. I'm running late, Joey. Otherwise we'd have a feast. Just don't buy any booze, all right. (gentle jazz music) A-N-G-S. Angst. I'd like to purchase 100 shares of ANGS. (jazz music) How can you be late if you set your watch fast? - What are you doing? - Watch ANGS. - [Ruben] What? - Here is comes. - [Ruben] Down five bucks. - That's right, highly volatile. Up, down, all over the place, which is how you make a killing if you time it right. So, what's so important? - I'm leaving Marcy. - [Lenny] Oh Jesus. - I can't take it anymore. - Yes, you can. You can take it all. - No. - Every three months we have this conversation, and you realize... - I'm leaving. - Okay, Ruben, you're leaving. - I've got money and I'm movin' out. - Okay, Ruben. - Did you hear me? I said I've got money and I'm moving out. - What is this money? - Never you mind, but it's done, I've got it. That's all you need to know, and now is the time. - [Lenny] Time for what? - Time to leave. - Holy Christ, Ruben. What are you, what are you doing walking around? - That's right. - What? What are you doing? Where, what's it from? - I told ya. Never mind. I have an arrangement. - Only Marcy's family has money like that. You're unhappy. Does that give you the right to make you a thief? - Nobody's a thief. - Then where'd you get it? - I want you to come with me. - What are you talking about? - [Ruben] Going away, we can do it. - Where you goin'? - Away, I just can't take it anymore. - You're not going anywhere. - You know I was thinking, there's places, there's places in Texas, in Louisiana, in Alabama. There's places. There's trailer homes by the sea. (laughing) Trailer homes by the sea. - [Ruben] Larger than most New York apartments, so don't talk about what you don't know. - Alabama, Ruben? They don't like New Yorkers in Alabama. What are you gonna do in Alabama? - It's cheap. - [Lenny] She won't find you there. - She'll be happy when I'm gone. And what are you doin' here, huh? Spinning your wheels, waiting to die. You can't keep going like this. Make it easy on yourself. - Oh Christ, I'm not going to Alabama. I'm not going anywhere. Do you think I could survive anywhere but here? Oh hold it. - [Ruben] Lenny. - What about the laws of karma you're always talking about? What about that? - I mean the laws of karma mean... - The laws of karma, what about the laws of New York state? - Justify taking 5,000 dollars from Miriam and Mo Weiss, huh. Justify that to the law of New York City, huh. Justify taking their hard earned money and throwing it away on a crap shoot just because you had too much coffee. - That's not how it is. - Okay, Lenny. Tell me how it is. I don't wanna go alone. - Well that's how you're going. (gentle music) - [Mimi] Hey. - Hey. - It's you. - It's you too. - Oh my God, this is so, you're just here? What are you doing here? - I'm here, here I am. What do you know? - I just came out of there. But, what, wait... - I wanna give you something. A present. - A present? - That's right. Come with me? - What are you doing? - I'm sorry. Have a cup of coffee with me, a danish, very quick, please? (laughing) You know I wanna talk to you. - What are you doing here? - The truth is I couldn't wait to see you. I couldn't wait to see if you'd call. I had to. Wait. - What's that? - It's your present. I told you. - No, Lenny. - What no? - You can't be giving me presents. That's crazy, you don't even know me. What are you doing? - It's a present. A person can't give another person a present? - [Mimi] It's a ring, isn't it? - How did you know? - It's in a ring box, Lenny. Oh boy. What are you doing? - When I first laid eyes on you it was all over for me. We don't have much time. Just give it a chance. - Really... I don't know what to say. But I can't take the ring. And I don't even know if I can see you again. You're a sweet man, Lenny. Really, you are. - What are you talking about? Take it, take the ring. What are you making such a big deal? Open it. Open it. (gentle music) - The announcement left shareholders with more than 53 billion dollars in losses. Accounting experts expect the collapse of ANGS will turn out to be far more complicated than what some have called a simple case of fraud. Shares of the stock plunged as much as 80 percent in early trading, to close at six dollars and 97 cents. (gentle music) (screaming) - What the hell's the matter with you, man? Damn man. (gentle music) (siren wailing) - Jesus H Christ, you almost did me a favor. What are you doing? - I came to say goodbye. - You came to say goodbye. Where are you going? - Alabama. - [Lenny] Take off your coat. (phone ringing) - [Ruben] Aren't you gonna answer your phone? - [Lenny] Let it ring. - What if it's your girl? - Hello? Well, hello, Mrs. Weiss. Yes, I did. Now now, calm down. Miriam. It's fine. No, no no. Don't panic. Who do you think you're dealing with? Do you think I would stack the deck with one company? - I know what I told you, but because of the structuring we're immune to all that. Not to worry. Oh, you shouldn't do that. Yes, but... We're looking for a correcting trend, starting tomorrow. Now don't worry. No, that's not a good idea. That's not a good idea at all. Of course I can, but I don't recommend it. Tomorrow? Of course, yes. Tomorrow? All right, all right. Yeah, see ya tomorrow. Goodnight. Goodnight to you too, Miriam, and my best to Mo. Goodnight. - What was that? - I heard some trouble today on the street. Did you see the news? - Tell me you were diversified. Just, tell me what you told Miriam was true, Lenny. Oh, Lenny. - [Lenny] They want their money back. - What's tomorrow? - That's when they want it. - And you lost it? - [Lenny] Everything. - There's something... There's something we can do. We can make a deal. I'll pay them the 5,000. Did you hear me? I said, I'll pay them. - You'll pay them? - Yeah. That's right, I'll pay them. Under a condition. I'll pay them the 5,000 if you come away with me. - What? - Will you do it? - You got 5,000? Plus money to leave? - I can get it. But we have to be gone. I'm gonna be gone anyway. I told you I was leavin'. - You don't have to leave New York. If you can get this money, then you can get more money. - I don't like it here. It's dirty, it's mean, it's cold. This isn't a nice city anymore, and I'm leavin', and I can help you settle this thing, but the deal is you come away with me. I don't wanna do it alone. Will you do it? - [Lenny] Not Alabama. - Doesn't have to be Alabama. I just want out. - [Lenny] Italy. - Italy? - [Lenny] That's right. - Italy's expensive. - [Lenny] It's Italy or nothing. - Oh Jesus, Lenny, what's with Italy? - [Lenny] And there's one more condition. - Conditions? I make the conditions. - [Lenny] Mimi comes with us. - What? - [Lenny] Mimi. - Lenny. - [Lenny] Otherwise I won't do it. - Ah, Lenny, come on. - It's a deal then. And when you get the ticket, it's me, Hotchkiss, H-O-T-C-H-K-I-S-S. That's hot kiss with a C-H for cha cha cha. I gotta get busy. What is it? You'll do it, won't ya? - I'll do it, all right? I'll do it. - Wonderful. What difference does it make? Me you and Marcy, me you and Mimi. It's better. She's a, she's a good girl. Ah, bingo. - What if I said no? No deal. - You wouldn't do that. And you didn't. - [Ruben] What if I did? - You couldn't, because you love me. Now get out of here so I can make a phone call. - [Ruben] I'll... I'll see you tomorrow then. - Yes, yes yes. (speaks foreign language) Mimi? - Who's this? - What do you mean, who is this? This is your lifetime calling. - Lenny? - You're damn right, and don't ask me how I got your number, because it's right here in the phone book for the whole world on display. That a girl. Listen, I'm calling to make an apology. I shouldn't have done what happened today. It's... I don't know, you move me. What can I say? I... I do foolish things because you move me. (laughing) I'm funny with ya, you see that? I make you laugh. - Yes, you do, Lenny. - I wanna make you laugh some more. I mean, I wanna make you laugh tomorrow. Can I do that? - I don't know about tomorrow. - It's gotta be tomorrow. I'm calling to officially and auspiciously ask for your hand for a date tomorrow. What do ya say? - Call me tomorrow and we'll see. - [Lenny] Tomorrow then. - I trusted you. - And you can still trust me. - We had a deal. - I know we had a deal, but deals change. - No, they don't, Ruben. That's what makes them deals. - I know Italy's expensive, but I'm not asking for more than the arrangement we have already, and I'll take care of 'im just like before. And this, this extra bonus or whatever you wanna call it, is an extenuating circumstance. - [Zac] Italy? That's so far away. - That's what he wants. That's the only way he'll do it. He's on a mission, and you want him outta your hair. - He's the only family I have. - Ah, once in a blue moon you saw him. I mean this is his dream, he's always wanted it. You'll visit you'll miss him so much. (ringback tone) (grunting) - What is that? - My suitcase. What do you think it is? You know, this isn't a vacation. It's goodbye New York. - Did you get the tickets? - Did I get the tickets? Yes, I got the tickets. - For Mimi too? Well? - Yes. - Let me see them. - What? You don't believe me? - I believe you, I just wanna see for myself. - Well, you're gonna have to trust me. - What's wrong with you? You're disgruntled. We're doing what you want. - Right, and we gotta get a move on 'cause the flight's in three hours. - You gotta do me a favor. - [Ruben] I do? - Yes. - [Ruben] A favor? - Go to the Weiss' and give 'em the money. - What, you're not coming? - [Lenny] I can't. - Why can't you? I'm giving you the 5,000 dollars and I have to deliver it? I mean, and then I have to take you in this Mimi woman away with me. I must be a pretty nice guy. - You are a pretty nice guy. And I love you, you know. - Why can't you come? - [Lenny] I have to pick her up. - Okay, but we ain't got time to mess around. Meet me. Where? - [Lenny] Where? Our corner. - What the hell are you talking about? - [Lenny] 19th and Irving. (ringback tone) - [Voiceover] It's Mimi, please leave a message. - Mimi, this is uh... - Lenny? - You're home. - [Mimi] I've been home all day. - I don't like to leave a message on that thing, because, well, you never know. - Where are you? - I'm on our corner. Where do you think I am? I've been down here since doomsday. Come down here, show yourself. I wanna talk to you. - You always wanna talk to me. - Now you got it. - I'll be down in a minute. (dramatic music) (ringback tone) - [Voiceover] It's Mimi, please leave a message. - Ah, it's okay if you don't wanna see me. I understand. I'm disappointed, but I mean it doesn't make a lot of sense, I suppose, you coming from your perimeter. What with me being who I am and you being who you are. - [Mimi] Lenny. (gentle music) Who are you talking to? - No one. Will you come with me? - What? - I have to go. Please. - You have to go where, Lenny? Lenny? - Italy. - [Mimi] What? - Italy. - What about Italy? - [Lenny] I want you to come with me. - Oh Lenny, stop being crazy. - I know if you don't wanna go, I... It's all right then, I understand why, but I want you to let me tell you something about you. - Okay. - You make me feel like I, like I felt like I did when I was a boy. - [Mimi] Oh Lenny. - When I was a boy I had this feeling, that I wanted to love somebody like nobody ever loved anybody before. - Oh, please, Lenny. - I'm saying that this is important. I felt like I had this love in me, and I wanted to give it to someone and all I had to do was just find that person, who it was, and just give it to them. I thought a few times I found that person. Once I, I was sure. But... She wasn't. Anyway, I lived my life without her until now. Without anything until now. I swear, Mimi, I could love you. I know I could. (gentle music) I know. I know you can't come to Italy with me or, or anywhere. I'm silly. - [Mimi] You're not silly. You're lovely. - I am? - [Mimi] Lenny, you're lovely. - Goodbye, Mimi. (gentle music) (lively music) (lively music) You know something? I love espresso. - [Ruben] I know, Lenny. - [Lenny] It's good, and good for you. Don't let anyone ever tell you espresso isn't good for you. Look at the Italians. One of the longest running civilizations we got, and where would they be without espresso? Don't tell me, I'll tell you. You know where? Nowhere. - [Ruben] Here? - There. Look at Italian design, look at the art. Marco Polo, Michelangelo, the Medicis. - Sophia Loren. - [Lenny] That's right. And where would they be? (speaking foreign language) (lively music) (lively jazz music)
