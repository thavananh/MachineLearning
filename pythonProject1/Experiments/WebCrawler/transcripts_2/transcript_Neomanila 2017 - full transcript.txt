foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Hey! Kid! Hang on. Where do you think you're going? Come here. What's the rush? What are you looking at? Are you just gonna stand there? Can't you talk? - Sir, that's... - Answer me! Sir, that's Kiko's brother. Okay, put him down. Come here. Do this. Make it thorough. Check his crotch. He's good. Hang on. Your brother isn't going anywhere until we have a replacement. Do you understand? Did you bring it? Any news on Ringgo? No one can tell where he is. You need to find Ringgo. He's the one they want. Won't Dugo get pissed if we turn Ringgo in? Once Ringgo's inside, we'll be out of Manila. They won't be able to find us. Toto. Don't do anything stupid out there. Thief! Get back here! To! Toto, you little shit! How's Kiko? He's still there, waiting for our move. He was actually pissed at me earlier. I'm sure the cops asked you about us. Yes. What did you say? I told them none of us are users. We just hang around here most of the time. Don't break, Toto. We'll take care of you. We're saving up for your brother's bail. Look at these guys. They're starving. They're setting aside some cash by selling ice. Thanks. I'll look for a sideline so I can contribute. Have you seen Gina? She's inside. Just finishing the mass. Get out of here. Get your head off your dick. Thou shall not kill. We've heard this so many times and yet most of us still believe if it's for the greater good, it's justified. Can there truly be a reason to kill? What are you doing here? Nothing. I just wanted to see you. What happened here? It's nothing. I just bit my lip. Yeah, right! Just leave it. Come on! I have something for you. Where are you guys going? Can I come? Toto has a surprise for me. Does he now? Let's see what you got. It's nothing. No wonder she still sees you. This idiot just keeps giving you gifts. I said it's nothing. To keep the Devil away! Who are you calling Devil? You need this. We're good ma'am. Thank you. Don't believe her. It's a scam. Just take it! No, thank you. Gina, let's go. Hey, To! There you go again! Your brother will kill you if he finds out what you're up to. I told you! I have something for you! We might get caught. We won't. There's no one here. What is this gift, anyway? You'll see. What's wrong? Nothing. It's bleeding again. Here, for your birthday. Don't be silly. It isn't for another week. Your brother's still in jail. You could sell this for bail money even if it isn't worth much. You don't like it? Just say so. I already have a phone and it works just fine. Don't be so dramatic. Aren't you saving up for him? Yeah. But we won't need it once they find Ringgo. He's the one they want. Haven't you heard? Ringgo's dead. Be careful. They're just waiting for you to make a mistake. This town acts like they knew Ringgo. They'll have you believe that he was some sort of saint. No one could save him. He was in too deep. It was only a matter of time. Then why did you light a candle? The fucker might haunt me. How's your brother? Still locked up in jail? Still no replacement? Everyone's too scared to talk. You better make sure he gets out soon. It's too dangerous for him to stay inside. Got a light? What's your problem? It feels good when you're wearing it. It's a turn on when you're on top of things. There was another raid last night. Where? In De Dios. They were looking for Ringgo. Why were they looking for him? I thought they wanted him dead. No idea. Maybe it was all just for show. They took in Kiko instead. Is he the older brother or the younger one? The older one. - Weren't you friends with his mother? Was it the father? - The mother. She died in the fire in Rosario. Poor kid. No brother and no mother. Sarge? What time? Where? Toto! Toto! Follow me! Hurry! Hurry! Someone's hungry. Don't be shy. Do you have a lot of enemies, Toto? Plenty. Ever been in a fight? Yes. I've had a few. One of them was sent to the hospital. Fool tried to take me out. I shut him down. He didn't know I had Kiko's knife. Have you killed anyone? No. Not yet. I almost did though. The guy I stabbed can't even eat now. What's so funny? A killer never talks. They know when to keep their mouths shut. Why do you ask, anyway? You helped us earlier. We're just returning the favor. How? So you can make money. I can run fast. I'm Dugo's errand boy when they're slinging ice. During the fire in Rosario, he was the only one who made it out. Are you prepared to leave everything behind to save yourself? Of course. What do I have to do? We have to go. We're being watched. Where? Behind Toto. Red shirt, black jacket. We're not alone in this line of work. Everyone wants a piece of the pie. The rats have come out of hiding. Everyone is after them. And now we're all stuck in this shithole. Since when do you smoke? Jealous? Everyone here smokes. Might as well. My brother taught me how, alright? What's your problem, Toto? If you want one, just ask. You fucking ruined the mood. I have a job. What have you gotten yourself into again? I don't know. It's with Tita Irma. They're hiring at her pest control shop. You know what, if you want to work, look for a real job. Why don't you ask Dugo? He has a lot of big time jobs. Big time? He can't even feed his five kids! You want me to work for him? Why don't you just go home? What's wrong? I just got here. Don't be stupid. I have work. Anyone home? Oh. Toto! Give me a hand. I'm heading out tonight. Are you in? Where to? I have a job to do. What exactly? - What time? - After midnight. Wear this. Oh, who owns this? Raul lives here too? That isn't Raul's. Oh, Irma. Come in. How are you, Mackoy? I'm doing well. You're here for the goods? Yeah. Kids, get out of here! Go on, upstairs! Irene, you too. Is this your son? He's grown! Fool! This isn't my son. Then who is he? Toto. He's just helping out. Are you going to sell to me or not? Relax! It's coming. Kurt, go get the package upstairs! How's your wife? She still hasn't ratted you out to her cop boyfriend? He's in on this too. He's my man on the inside. What a clever love triangle! Perfect for a soap opera! Idiot! How long have we been at this? I said the one that's wrapped in paper! Hurry up! You should know this by now. Hurry up, Kurt! There! Give me that. Here. Beretta. 9mm. It's clean. No bloodstains. Unlike the one before, totally unusable. Don't ask me where I got it from. This one's for him. What for? 'Cause you're my number one customer. Are you surprised? You'll learn eventually. God damn it. Why is it so cold? It's chilly. That's nothing. It's just nerves. I'm not nervous. Are you sure? When I'm nervous, this bleeds. Let's see later. Whatever happens, listen to me. Just do as I tell you and you won't get hurt. Get in. Where'd you find this? Are you sure this is clean? Just relax. There you go again. I took care of it. I already changed the plates. Load the gun, Toto. Don't you know how? Know how to handle a gun, even in the dark. We're being watched. CCTV. Let go of that. Here. Use the light. Hand me the gun. Why did you make me load it? Stop asking questions. Toto, stay close. Don't be afraid. This is all just a nightmare. Sorry. Fuck. Why are there so many? And? Is it your first time? - They're all minors. - Just shut up. What's wrong? Ice. Time to go. Here's your cut. Careful who you sell it to. You might get caught. Take it, Toto. This should help you with your brother's bail. Take care of yourself, okay? It's time. Chief, he just got here. Chief! He just got here! Fresh meat! Chief, chief! He still has his handcuffs. He's still cuffed! - What the fuck is going on? - What is that? Son of a bitch! What do you have behind you? Speak up! Grab him! Search him! Motherfucker! What do you have behind you?! Oh shit! Jesus Chri- You dumb addict! We've got you! You're dead! You shitheads! I'll fuck your moms! Gina! Toto! Fuck you, Dugo! Stop it! What's wrong with you, Toto? Fuck you! Let's talk about this. Don't go starting shit around here. What did you do to my brother? Who's the bigger fuck-up here? You, who rats us out to the cops? Or me, who's just trying to protect my brothers? You motherfucker! Stop it! Stop that! I'll leave a sign on your corpse, so everyone will know what you are. What are you still doing here?! Are you just gonna stand there?! Watch your back. Check if this fits you. Where's Raul? He doesn't live here. I already told you. Where is he now? He's working at Jimenez's. Business is booming. The funeral home? Yeah. He earns a lot from Violet. They're living off the dead. Toto, are you done? Yes. Go ahead and add more. Those fucking rats. They chew through everything. Nothing is spared. Someday, you'll get yours. Isn't it ironic having rats at your shop? If people find out, it's bad for business. I've caught them so many times but they always slip away. Come on, let's go. Can you get that one? Fool! Let's go! Where to now? Just follow me. Thanks for the food and for the shirt. No problem. How did you know my mother? We used to sell counterfeit items upstairs. Our stalls were next to each other She used to always worry about you and Kiko. She had a hard time with Kiko. At least you're different. Fake Rolex, fake Nike. You name it. That's how we made a living. Since they discovered the drug trade here, the place is now swarming with cops. Most of them have left. Pick one. What? Go on. Before I change my mind. Does it fit? - We'll take these. - Alright. The surroundings dimmed Someone called out my name Eleven floors He asked if I was okay then he handed me a glass Someone's waiting Now that I've had enough I don't want it anymore And now I still don't know why we are here Can we stop the world from turning Can we stop the world from turning the world from turning Are you going out again tonight? Can I come? Why? You're brother's dead so you don't need to work so hard. Even if I had Gina or Kiko, I'm going to die no matter what I do. What's your plan? I don't know. But- Toto, it's not always that easy. Sometimes they outnumber us and some are armed. Sometimes they fight back. Stay here. We don't need you tonight. You're nervous, aren't you? You're fidgeting. You wanted in, didn't you? Leave him alone. He wants to earn his keep. I knew your brother. I drank with him once. He drinks like a fish! But he's a nice kid. Suspect or victim. There's really no difference. We're close. Hey! It's been too long! What happened to you? Your son is so handsome. He's not my son. Even better! Honey, how much is she paying you? Wanna work for me instead? I'll pay you double. Interested? Do you know her? She makes porn and sends them to foreigners. She doesn't discriminate! Caucasian, Black, Asian, Latino, gay, lesbian, pigs! Everyone's welcome! Which one? You pay as you order here. If I were you, I'd settle it now. Once we're inside, I'm sure you'll cause trouble again and I won't be able to get any. I don't have money. Do you want to talk to Sarge? Sarge? Okay, okay. Just don't go waving your gun around or else... I'll shoot you. Sometimes you're too much. Let's go inside. Amanda! Amanda, this is Irma, and Cutie. Irma, meet Amanda. She's my MVP. The locals love her. They think she's white but she's just a freak. Do you know her? That's her. Be careful. Don't get caught. Fuck. Why is there a kid? That's a dead end. I bet the drugs are in her bag. Where else? Unless she packed them in her pussy. Didn't you say you run fast? Motherfucker! Thief! Son of a bitch! Come back here! You fucker! Hey! Thief! Where is it?! Shut up and find it! Toto, make the kid shut up! Raul! - Raul! She's waking up! - Give me the tape! Help! Help! - She's awake! - Give me the tape! Faster, Raul! - Here! Take it! - The door lock! Here's the tape. Help! Help! Head to the tracks. Have mercy! This is you, right? That's not me! This is you! Are you sure about the faggot? She might be misleading us. She wouldn't do that. We go way back. Bitch! Stop messing with us! Where are the drugs?! - I don't know anything. - Where are the drugs? - Where are the drugs? - I don't know! - Where are the drugs? - Please! Please! I don't have it! But I know where to find it! Where? I can take you there! - Where? - I'll show you! Motherfucker! That's enough! What do I do with this now? - Just put a sign over her! - What? Do it unless you want to get caught! This shit's hard enough as it is and we don't even know what the fuck we're doing! I said I'm sure! For fuck's sake! What's his problem? I don't know. Let me hold him. What's this? Help me check. No matter how tough it gets, always remember, victims, suspects... they're all the same. The kid... he's innocent. Fuck this shit. It's raining. How will they see what I wrote on the sign? Fuck, a checkpoint. Stay calm. This shouldn't be here. Good evening, sir. Just a routine inspection. Your license, please. Here you go, sir. Where are you headed? Not far, sir. Is this your family? Hey, kid. Do you know these people? Answer! They're my parents, sir. What's your last name? Orias, sir. Our last name's Orias. Was I talking to you? Don't you think it's a bit rude to butt in? We're just doing our jobs. This is protocol. We're looking for a kid. Same age and built as him. I'll take care of this. Hang on! Be careful out there. Yes, sir. How did you handle it? Are we good? Fuck it! It doesn't matter as long as we got out of there. You know we're not supposed to use Sarge's name! Fuck it! Do you think Sarge is double crossing us? Why would he? So why was there a checkpoint? He knew we were passing through. We could've been caught! Do you still trust him? I've never really trusted him. He can get rid of us anytime, you know that! And still you mentioned his name! Of course, he'll be pissed. Let's call him up. - Are you sure? - Let's settle this. Toto! What took you so long? Toto, it's worse if... you don't feel fear anymore. Something came up. What did he say? He's looking for an asset. The police at the checkpoint weren't lying. They said a teenage boy, same built as Toto. We just have to find that fucking snitch. Was he mad? What else did he say? That's all he said. Sounds like he's serious. He just gave the address. Stay here, Toto. You go that way. Raul, someone's here! Get him, Toto! Hurry, Toto, don't let him get away! Go after him! Raul, he ran up! Hurry! Don't let him get away! Raul, he's over here! Son of a bitch! Fucking kid, wasting our time! You fucking junkie! You're giving us a hard time! Finish him, Toto. Why me? Fuck. I'm tired! I just want to go home! You want to be one of us?! Then pull the trigger! Toto. Kill him, Toto! For fuck's sake, Toto! Finish him! Fuck. Irma! Help me. Elias. I've been looking for you. You keep disappearing. You're so stubborn. You never listen. You're high again. That's why you're getting skinny. I got rid of all your friends but you still won't stop. Elias, look at me. Who are you? Fuck you! You really are your father's son! Be thankful I got to you first. They wouldn't have stopped looking for you. Who was the kid? You had to screw him over, too? Toto is not a killer! He's not a drug addict! He's not a fuck up like you! I don't have clothes for you. We need to leave. They're hunting us down. Don't worry. We'll move far away. No one will bother us anymore. They're all gone. Shit! Elias! Fucking... I am innocent.
