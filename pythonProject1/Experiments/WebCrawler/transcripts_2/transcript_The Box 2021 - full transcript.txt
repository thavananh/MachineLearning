We will not hand over remains that aren't verified with the proper documentation. Next. This is my grandmother's letter of authorization. Family member's birth certificate? - Relation? - He's my father. This ID was found with the body. He was identified as Esteban Espinoza Leyva. Full name. Here. This one is yours. Sign all four sheets. Your signature and date of receipt. I'm in the room now, Grandma. Yes, I have it. I'm not crying, Grandma. I said I'm not crying. Yes, don't worry. I love you, too. See you tomorrow. Excuse me. Esteban? What? Esteban Leyva? No, that's not my name. Who are you? I'm Hatzin! Nice to meet you. Mario Enderle. You're Esteban. I said that's not my name. Weren't you on that bus? They're calling you. Hurry, they're leaving. I'm looking for Mario. The man who sells jackets. He was there not long ago. He doesn't sell them, he gives them away. Do you know where I can find him? Excuse me, sir? I just want to know if there's a mistake. Why? This wasn't for me. Be thankful you found him. They usually don't. It was a mistake. Kid! Hey, kid! Kid! Kid! They made a mistake. I'm not leaving until they give it to me, Grandma. You can't come, Grandma. I already have a place to stay. They're giving me room and board. I'm coming! - Just a moment. - I'm looking for Mr. Mario. Sweetheart! Someone is here to see you. You. What are you doing here? - Your bus? - It's gone. The bus. Now what do you want? I remember you. Not just from the photo. I'm not the person you're looking for. You're confused. - It's not me. - Here you go, sir. Enjoy. Who do you live with in the city? With my grandmother. And how is she? She's fine. But she has diabetes. That's why she couldn't come. What else? Do you go to school? I'm in 7th grade. I'm almost in 8th grade. Good. Very good. Don't fuck up like I did. Finish school. Yes. I have to go. Look. This is for you to go home. This is for the bill. Don't get into trouble. - Good morning. - Morning! I have a message for Mr. Mario. He just left. He's finding people. - It's important. - Wait for him at the factory then. - The one at the entrance to the town? - No. The big one. The one just past the entrance. Thank you. Yes. That's everything. Why don't you come back next week? Maybe there'll be a job for you. Thank you very much. Excuse me. - What is it? - Do you know this employee? Esteban Espinoza Leyva. Efr√©n. Be careful, follow the security protocols. Are you looking for a relative? Come. Work hard and the company will reward you. Wait for me here. He's not registered here. Maybe he's in another factory. What about Mario Enderle? Where are we going? A bus to Mexico City comes through here at dawn. Get out. I said get out. Didn't I tell you to go? Come here. What did I tell you? Huh? I'm not going back. You're a crazy fucker. Get down. Grab that one. Madam, you're going to have to leave. The lady back there, too. You already know we're at war! We're at war with the fucking Chinese. The problem is that little Chinese girls have tiny little hands. And they're fast as fuck. What happens if they're faster than us? They take our jobs... And will we let them take our jobs? All right, then. Get your papers ready. - Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. - Good morning. Madam, how are you? It's good to see you. For those who don't know: you are paid weekly. And as of now, we're in charge of everything. We're in charge of feeding you. And giving you a place to sleep. Before you board, we'll give you a jacket to ward off this fucking cold. Thank you. So if you're ready, make a line over here. With your papers ready. Even better if you have copies. It has to be an official identification card. Let's go. Gather over here. That's it. How long have you worked with Mario? Some time now, man. If it hadn't been for him, my mom would have died. Her intestines were all messed up. He helped me take her to the hospital. He wasn't born here, was he? Sure he was. He told me he was born in Chihuahua. Did he tell you something different? Let's go. Your turn. Since his ID was there, they say he's going to show up, Grandma. I'll go back when they close the pit. Besides, I got a job. Finding people to work in factories. The important thing to know here is: everyone has their own problem. There are those who miss home. They're slow to work and return home quickly. Then there are the friendly ones. The problem with them: they're always hungover. Or there are others who work too hard. They're all intense. But they're the first ones to get sick. That's why we're here. To work out which one's which. Understand? Francisca Mendoza. Give her a jacket. Ramiro Quezada. Go on in. Edmundo Gonzales. - Epigmenio Manriquez. - They call me Chucho. And what will we do about your leg, Chucho? We can't pay you in full. How about we pay you half? What do you think? It's just a joke. Go on in. Give him a jacket. We don't discriminate against anyone. There's work for everyone. Even for ugly people like this man. Antonio Bastillos. Laura Morales. Do we get paid once we arrive? No, I don't know. Jesus Enrique Fierro? Go on in. Go in through the door, one by one. Go in one by one. Let's see. Give me a hand. Take this notebook. On the last page, I wrote down the number of workers I hired this week. A new factory is asking me for 1,500 people. How long do you think it will take? Twenty-four weeks. Between 24 and 25. Half a year. What's going on? Hey. He says you write everything down because you went to school. Are you married? Where's your husband? - Do you have children? - Yes. They can come and visit you, if you want. - What is your name? - Alma Ruiz Carrasco Jurado. You signed a 12-hour contract like everyone else. But the law says the two-hour break is paid. You're not counting that. We're working 14 hours, not 12. Those two hours are compensation for when you don't finish on time. But I do. You're also making us do things that aren't in the contract. I'm sorry. That's compensation, too. Delay on sewing line four. Delay on sewing line four. - How are things, Julio? - What's up, Mario? Hey. Hi. Why didn't you tell us we were paying for the trip here? What? You docked our pay for the trip over here. Didn't you know? You are too honest. You shouldn't reveal too much in this job. Don't you ever lie? Sometimes I tell my grandma stories. Let's see. Tell me a lie. - Tell you a lie? - Sure. Lie to me. My name is Manuel Sanchez. That's not a lie, that's bullshit. Go to the back. What's going on, Mario? They docked you four people. They left the day after they came. They couldn't handle the 48 hours. Thirty-four in total. Two of those men arrived on Friday, not on Monday. They were here all weekend. That's more than 48 hours. Are you sure? Do you know their names? He's right. Look. This is yours for the week. Thank you. Sir? I'm going back to Mexico City tomorrow. I don't like it here. I wanted to let you know. It's a lie! It's just a joke. Fucking kid. I believed it! Good. Better, right? You'll be more comfortable here. Fucking Poncho. No, I don't have time for you. - What's your fucking time worth? - More than your fucking balls, asshole. Have some respect, you came out of them. What's happening, man? - What's up, Richie? - Hey. - Just here working. - That's everything. - Congratulations. - Thanks, man. - It's fucking cool. - It is. When do the machines arrive? - The first truck, on the 14th. - This month? Yeah, this fucking place will be running in two months. - Yeah, well you got it. - Yeah. It's a good start! I'll bring you three busloads of people. At a special price. No extra cost. - Really, man? - Yeah. Deal. This fucking place is huge. Who could dry the sea? Who could lower the stars? Who could ease my burden? Did you always work for the factory? Yes. I worked... as a foreman for a while, but that paid bad. Then, I took advantage of an opportunity. We're going to have our own factory. I have a warehouse. We won't have to travel anymore. What do you think? The sewing machines are going here. And over there is the ironing area. Is that it? That's it. Fill it up, please. Sir. Can you help carry my mother to the bathroom? She fell. I don't know what's wrong with her. She's back there. The key! Open that box and lean it against the wall. Don't cross near the gas station. Leave it at the entrance to the town. In the store we sell clothes and toys for children. Necklaces and earrings, too. Stop by and I'll give you some. Thank you. Where do you get them? The States. Mario takes me there to buy them. - Right, sweetheart? Sweetheart! - What? You take me to the States to buy stuff for the store. Yeah, it all comes from China. But we'll make them here in our factory. We'll make clothes, even toys. Nicer and cheaper. Do you want your meat well done or medium rare? - Well done for me. - Well done, you too? Pay attention because this is serious. You all know that studies have shown that women are smarter than men. But guess when they lose all their intelligence. When they shut their husband's coffin. Come here. No, no. Here. I want you here! You're not happy? Are you riling people up? You're getting paid weekly, not by the hour. You're getting food, a place to sleep. Don't cause problems. You signed a contract. Did you or didn't you? You signed it! Stop fucking around. Be happy with what you have. Go back to work! Move it! If I could soar to the stars. I would take you with me. Where nobody could see us. Don't listen to them. Lose yourself and love me more. If this is a scandal. Better than never knowing how to love. Take it to the truck. Who is it? It's better not to know. You already know we're at war. And do you know who we're at war with? The fucking Chinese. The problem is that little Chinese girls have tiny little hands. And they're fast as fuck. What happens if they're faster than us? - They take our jobs. - And will we let them take our jobs? Did you bring your documents? Step over there. Get in. Step over there. There are people who won't let you help them. Don't feel bad. It's not worth it. Get that out of your head. - Your week's pay. - Thank you. Let's go. I'll stay and wait for the jackets. They haven't arrived yet. Fine. I'll pick you up later. How's it going? - What's up? - Hey. Who was that lady? She is... She's the mother of a girl who works here. But she went missing. These are the first images of the pits where human bones and skulls were discovered, remains of at least 50 people. We are terrified by the recent discoveries. We're hoping they're not in here. Like Linda, dozens of women search under the hot sun and through undergrowth for clues. We're fed up. We want to find people who are alive, not dead. The incompetence of the authorities was clear... Let's go. From the start of the exhumations when agreements made with the families of the missing people were not honored. We're not only looking for our children. We're looking for every missing person. Mr. Chucho. Remember me? I brought you here from your town. I'm looking for the girl who came here with you. Laura Morales. White skin. No. I haven't seen her. - She's from your town. - No. I haven't seen her. Laura Morales' mother? Stop looking for your daughter. She's dead. Hatzin! Hand me the brake liquid underneath the back seat. How's your grandma? I don't know. I haven't spoken with her. Don't neglect her. My father died young. I hardly remember him. The only thing I remember is his bad ass motorcycle. But I hardly knew him. Like you, with yours. You work like a donkey your whole life. At the end of the day, family is all you have. What were you doing yesterday in Las Marias? You were there, weren't you? You wouldn't betray me, would you? No, commander. As you can see, nobody knows anything. - Nothing at all? - We haven't heard anything. - Afternoon. - Afternoon. What happened? The missing girl's mother got a call saying her daughter was dead. - Damn! - You don't know anything? No, this is the first I heard. And they're starting an investigation as of now. - Like the girl last month. - Exactly. Fucking drug dealers. - We'll be coming back. - Yeah. - Of course, commander. - Thanks. Let's go. Let me know when they're back. Where are you from, brother? - I'm from Chihuahua. - From Chihuahua. Is it nice to live there? Yeah, it's cool. Pass me the salt? I remember you, too. When you peed all over me. But nobody can know this. What do you have there? - Thank you, sweetheart. - You're welcome, love. The tortillas... Look at this mess. Could you bring me a rag? You weren't even there when my mom died. I'm sorry. I won't let you down anymore. Believe me. It's like 1,600 yards or so. 1,600 yards? It's going to be expensive. - Are you sure is 1,600 yards? - Yes, it's the perimeter. Let's be sure. They say the fence is 1,600 yards long. I think it's less. I'll check with Richie. Touch him. Look. Take it. It's yours. Calm down. Calm down. Here you go, enjoy. - Sir, could I have my check, please? - Of course. Thank you. - Could I have a receipt, please? - Sure. IF YOU GO BACK TO THE POLICE, WE'LL KILL THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY. Grab the sledgehammer and hit this over here. The other way. What did the policeman want? What do you think he wanted? Grandma? I want you to know that I think about you every day. I love you very much. Hatzin. Come. Look at your sister. Hold her. Hold her! Careful with her head. Are you an idiot? Are you fucking crazy? Hatzin! Where do you think you're going? You're going to die, you fool! Boy? Boy! Ruben! Ruben! So, it wasn't a mistake. Signature of receipt here, please. THE BOX
