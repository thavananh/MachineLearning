When I Became A Butterfly Freely based on a true story Rascal Bastard Evill Slacker That's how you call those who don't care about their honor. Miserable. Recently Hamid told me this once. But I didn't know the meaning. Stupid as he is, He probably dosen't know its meaning either. Why is the door left open? It's geting cold in here. Instead, but it gets warm up here. Kasra, Kasra, could you bring me the laundry detergent? I'm busy now. Aren't you going to fix the washing machine? It's been out of order for 3 months. I need to call a repariman to come and fix it. Then give him a call! Let me find one of my friend who does this job. Of course, you are not the one washing the clothes by hand. You have been ruining my life for 3 months. [Television] Lately you've become interested in late-night movies! Mr. Mostafa's spouse, it's your turn. Mr.Mostafa's spouse... Mr.Mostafa's spouse. Yes, Hello. Hello, please tell Mr. Mostafa not to throw his cigarette butts down here. It's been a few days I wanted to tell him, but he didn't show up. I didn't want to bother you and knock on your door to tell you this. I'm sorry! I will tell him. You keep saying "I'm sorry" all the time. Yesterday, he threw a cigarette butt it was about to fall in my customer's collar. I was the one who got embarrassed, not him. He doesn't care at all. I said that I'm sorry, I'll tell him. You guys have a great patio, why doesn't he go there to smoke his cigarettes? Why does he have to smoke by the window? Where's Kasra? I sent him to buy cigarettes for me. Why didn't you ask me to buy them for you? It's not appropriate for a lady! Do you think it is appropriate for a kid? What that nosy jerk was saying again? Thanks God he can only exert his power on birds. Otherwise, he would also put humans in cage. You bought fish again? I can't stand its gross smell! It can't be worse than the smell of cigarettes. What? It can't be worse than the smell of cigarettes. How can you tolerate the fish smell but not my cigarette smell? How about you? You can put up with the gross cigarettes smell but not fish? Clean it up! You aren't scared of its dead body, are you? I am not scared, I just find it disgusting. Give me a break! You find me disgusting too, but why don't you shout when you see me? Don't start again. In front of the kid, you ask me not to argue. In his absence, you also ask me not to argue. So when can I share with you the stuff I have on my heart? Whenever I die, come to my grave and talk freely. - Then, I wouldn't argue with you. - Really? Listen, when I die, you have no right to visit me and say even one word. Because, I've heard more than enough of you in this world. Dad, can you pass me the water? Take it yourself my friend. Is it too hard? Because in our book, it is mentioned:" Dad gives water, Dad gives the bread". Nothing is mentioned about what mom gives? Be careful, wait. Make sure it doesn't scratch the wall. I swear. I can't stand him anymore. For sure, he says he has quit his addiction, it has been a month now. But he takes it as an excuse to sit at home all the time. Neither he looks for a job, nor even steps out of the house. How come it is none of your business? You are his mother! Tell him something, for God's sake, He might listen to you more than me, what I say, he does against it. No, no problem. I am sorry I called during the call for prayer. Please pray for me. Allo! What the hell, you called so early? Now that you woke me up, you can keep saying your nonsense words. Where are you? See you in 10 minutes by the lamp-post. You have a cellphone, why do you give the landline number to your friends? - My cellphone is turned off. - Then turn it on! You can't just pass the landline number to everybody. For God's sake, go back to sleep! You think I'm eager to listen to your repetitive words? I was asleep! The call woke me up! Kasra! Kasra! Get up son! Get up! Get up, I need your help. Good morning. Good morning. It's a secret between us, don't tell mum about it. Alright? What do you have in your hand? Huh? I said what do you have in your hand? Give me your hand! What do you have in your hand? Huh? What do you have in your hand? - Daddy! - What did you give to the kid? Mind your own business! Do I ever meddle in your cooking and vacuum cleaning? Aren't you ashamed? Didn't you swear never to touch drugs again? Now you want to get your kid involved in this? Get out of here, wife. That nosy jerk down there has reported me to the police thousands of times. If I step out, they'll catch me. Unless you want this? Why should the police arrest you? Huh? Why? Get out of here. You are getting on my nerves! Look, I swear I won't let the kid to go out! I swear! Daddy! My hand! Ouch! If you can take it out of his hand, I'll give you a medal. Ouch! My hand. - Give it to me! - I won't. - You are really setting me off! Kasra will need to walk over my dead body before walking out. Do you want the neighbors to hear us? I don't care, it's not like it's the first time. Then give me the damn thing! I won't! You call yourself a man? Does a man do such things to his kids? I'm not a kid! Does a man earn money like this? What's wrong with it? You know very well how to spend the money. If you don't want to work, I'll work like a man to avoid begging from you and your dirty business. I can't work? Do you remember the job I had in this slaughterhouse. You were complaining so much about the smell that I had to leave it. Of course! They kicked you out like a dog when they found out you were a drug addict! Give it to me. They didn't kick me out, they were all junkies out there. - Go do your duty properly if you can! - That duty, huh? Give me that shit! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give it to me! Daddy? Daddy! Are you ok? Daddy, wake up! Open your eyes! Daddy, get up, daddy! Get up! Are you ok? For God's sake... Get up. Dad! Open the door! I want to get out. For God's sake open the door! Mum open the door, I want to get out. Why do you want to get out? Open it! Open the door. Do you promise not to make any noise? I promise. Do you promise not to escape? I promise. You killed him? Me? Was it my fault? Yes, it was your fault. I want my dad, you killed him. I'm no match for your dad, I'm weak. He fell himself. No, you killed him. He started the fight and pulled my scarf. It was his fault. Do you know what is the penalty of drug deal? You were going to do this Do you know what the police will do if they understand? It didn't matter to your father, but it did to me. I want my dad. Here, if you think I am guilty, call the police so they arrest me now. They will take me to prison and you to an orphanage. [Call for prayer] Where's dad? In the yard. I want my dad. We can't keep him here. We need to take him out of the house. From now on, only use the toilets in the yard. Kasra? Kasra? Won't you give me a hand? Kasra? Leave me alone! Crazy, murderer, miserable, killer. Let me go! I want to tell everyone. Open the door! Open the door! I've prepared your breakfast. It's on the table. I'm going out, do you need anything? Don't touch daddy until I return and see what we can do, ok? Ok? I'm scared. What are you scared of? Of a dead body? It's not scary, It's like a toy or a doll. I know, but still. You claim to have become a man. And now you're scared of a dead body? It is Dad. It was dad! It's only a corpse, now. From now on I'm both your mom and dad, got it? And you are both my son and the man in this house. You too are scared. I used to be afraid when he was alive, not now. I need you now. If you want to prove me you've become a man, now it's the time. Being a man isn't about the things your dad used to tell you about. It's about being brave and afraid of nothing. Its about not crying. Ok? I didn't want this to happen. But it did happen. Hi! Thanks a lot. If I knew he would listen you so well, I would've told you earlier. Believe me I told him several times, he wouldn't listen to me. Send him my regards. I haven't seen him lately! Shall I make it 1 kilo? No, half a kilo is enough. Look, it's a first-class lamb meat. It will be sold out by the time you come back. It's ok, thanks. How's Mr. Mostafa? Has he found a job? Not yet. I told him several times not to leave the slaughterhouse. But he wouldn't listen, he assumed he could get another job easily. - Hi! - Hi! How are you? Fine. Mr. Kamal, Mostafa is asking for a favor tonight. Sure, what is it about? We want to sell some old furniture. What kind of furniture? A dresser and other stuff like that. Can I see them? Are they still in a good condition? - Yes, actually they're sold, sorry. - What time shall I come? Come around sunset. Park the van by the door. We will load the van ourself and let you know when we are done. Tell me if I can help. Thanks, we'll load them ourself as they're quite fragile. Are you sure? Yes, thanks. Ok, where are you sending them to? We will give you the address tonight. At your service. Just send my regards to Mr.Mostafa and tell him to treat me more fairly. Hello, is Mr. Mostafa at home? No, he isn't. We had an appointment two days ago. He didn't show up and hasn't answered his phone since. - I'm worried about him, is he ok? - Yes, but he isn't home. If he is at home, please tell him Faramarz is waiting outside and urgently needs to see you. I told you he's not at home. Don't come here anymore. I have no one in the neighborhood except Mr.Mostafa. Please don't disturb us anymore. I don't mean to disturb anybody! I am just begging you to tell him to turn on his cellphone. Bye! Tell him I won't come here anymore. I was just worried about him. Bye! It was grandma, she wanted to talk to dad. I said he's in the shower. She said she would come tomorrow. - Yes? - Hi! I brought you the car, shall I park it by the door? Hello Mr. Kamal, we've cancelled moving the furniture tonight. Mostafa was supposed to tell you, but it seems he forgot to do it. No problem, is he at home now? Yes, he says hi. Can you tell him to come out a second? I need to see him briefly. I couldn't see him for ages! He is busy right now, he can't. No problem, I'll be waiting outside until his job is done. He said he will be busy for a while, what do you want from him? Tell him sorry, please give back the 40 thousand tomans borrowed last month. I need it to repair the car, otherwise I swear I wouldn't even mention it. Hi, I'm really sorry I'm bothering you, but it is Mostafa's fault. He told me just for one day but it's been a month now, otherwise I wouldn't bother you for it. Please send my regards to him. Hi, tell Mostafa to come here. He isn't home. He was there a minute ago. Well now he is not here anymore, what do you want from him? Don't you know who I am and what I want? Huh? I'll tel him to call you as soon as he comes back. Stop it! Tell him to come here, I know he's there! I told you he's not here, go away! Look! Tell him a man doesn't hide himself in his house and send his wife out! A man doesn't beg for 250 grams of drug and disappears. And what do you want me to do about it? I want you to go inside now and ask him how many days does he want to hide himself there? At the end I'll get him whenever he is out and I'll get my money back. I'll call the police if you don't leave right away. The police? Call them to capture the thing, if it is going to be taken up. One more word and I will tell him you've been bothering me! Look, tell him if he believes that he can get away with it, he's dead wrong. Tell him to turn on his phone, now! I can't stay here anymore, mom. Neither can I, but I have to. Until when you want to keep daddy? Until he wants. But he's dead, He does not understand anything. He didn't understand when he was alive too. But I knew what he wanted. I really miss him. Do you want to give him a massage? He used to like it very much. Why did you come upstairs with your foot ache? Let me wake him up to come downstairs. No, don't do that if he is tired, don't wake him up. He didn't sleep the whole night, you know he's been in rehab these days. But he gets upset if I don't wake him up. No problem. When he gets up, he will come downstairs. Whenever he decides to quit his addiction, he sleeps from morning to night to control his stress. Try to be more lenient with him. Life is shorter than this which a lady argues with her husband, God doesn't like it. What kind of argument? We are good with each other. But it seems you are always nagging at him. It's not true, It is so common among each and every couple. If I tell you some things, I just open up my heart to you. And I am here to do the same. My girl, I am old enough, my death is near, I have pain in my whole body. But I can still think. We, old women, when our husband were talking to us, we couldn't keep our chin up even if they hit us, we were more tolerate. Because of that, marriages were ever-lasting. What if more matrimonial stuff were taught at universities and other organizations, It would be more useful than anything else for women. Thanks God that I don't go none of those places! By the way, Mostafa found a job, he is going to go south with one of his friend. Ok, Thanks God, be thankful to God. Yes, everything is going to be better. He is overcoming his addiction as well as finding a job, Thanks God. Kasra you sweetheart, check TV, when is praying time? Kasra? Don't you need anything? Aren't you hungry? Kasra? I don't wanna hear you crying anymore. Understood? even one more time. Give me a pocket of that cigarette please. What kind of? The red one. This one? No, that one. Here you are. Give two. Sorry, three. Take it, it is not female. [Educational sciences] [How to help an agitated child] Let the clutch in tightly, shift the gear then let the clutch out slowly and give it some gas. If you let the clutch suddenly out, this happens again. Shift the gear! Clutch! Becareful! Brake now! I really wanted to kick his ass! Eh!? What did I say?! Of being a man, why you've learned impoliteness? It's out of my control, I do my best to forget those words but I can't be successful. I have a good memory. A good memory forgets bad stuff. - Hello. - Hello. So, where is it? There. What's wrong with it? It's working, but the water is leaking from all its parts. All its part? Mainly lower section. Lower. Its tubs, its belt is out of order I guess. I will take a look at it. What a lovely smell "Espand". I'm really crazy about such smell. Here you are. Wow, what a vivid tea, Thanks a lot. Whenever, I don't drink tea, I become like a car without fuel. This tea can be taken as a premium gas for me. Is it clear how much does it cost? Be my guest. Just give me a discount. Sure, I told you be my guest. I imagine that I got stuck in the traffic. No way. Yeah, why not? You know what, I am not used to talk while working. Let me finish this, and then we will discuss about it. Excuse me. Well, It's done lady. How soon! Don't put it on uneven ground. You were lucky that water didn't go into the engine. I changed its rubber, hose and belt. In total, 27 thousand. There's no God just one. [The neighbour nagging about falling cigarette buts] Well done! Turn! Let's go daddy. Mr. Mostafa! Mr. Mostafa!

No, just remove its feathers. Tell Mr. Mostafa that it is unfaithful to act like that behaviour two nights ago. Take me with you too. No it's not needed. Mostafa, Mr Mostafa... Mostafa. Mr. Mostafa. Mr. Mostafa. Mr. Mostafa. What the hell did you do, sir? Are you blind? You men are always criticizing women's driving, I'm talking to you, are you dumb? Where? You damaged my car, now you leaving, sir? Hello, How are you? Because, Mostafa called you two, three times when he was going to south. But you didn't answer, we became worried. I don't know, maybe you were saying your prayer. Yes he went. He was in hurry. He said he would call you when he arrives there. I don't know, he went with one of his friend whom I didn't know. A friend in his military service. He said he is going to work and save money to solve all of our problems. Hope in God. Thanks, bye. - Hi! - Hi! What I can do for you? I came for recruitment.

Do you have any experience in sales? Yes, sure. For a couple of years. I love sales, some of our customers used to get there just for me. Great! I don't know, every time I called him, his cell phone is off. I got butterflies in my stomach. I called every where! Police stations, hospital, forensic medicine. I don't know even what city he went to. Excuse me, I made you worried. Generally, he is a happy-go-lucky person, perhaps he has lost his cellphone. He is not even thinking about calling us. No, why you! With your foot ache. I will look for him. Yes, pray for him that nothing happens for him. Ok, sure. Thanks, bye. [WC] Follow me please. These are our coat set. All of them are made overseas. This one is rich velvet. This one is corduroy. And the last one is plaid wool one in two available colors. This one in 5 and that one in 3 colors Tell me which one do you prefer to try it on and see whether it looks good on you. For what occasion do you want to wear? Hi! I am Kasra. Kasra. - Hi! - Hi! My son. How early you came! Dad told "I would be home in one hour" let's go sooner, ok. You look so pretty, mom! I'm always pretty! Let's go home with your current appearance, ok? No way! The neighbors might see us. No problem, who cares? You want our neighbors label me in your dad's absence? Mom! Why don't we have a car? Didn't you ask your dad? Yup, he said at least we have a motorcycle. But you are a lady, motorcycle is not appropriate for you. You should have a car. One's value is not measured by his shortage. So how? It's about the things he desires to have. Mom! Are we miserable? No... Neither miserable nor fortunate. You know who is miserable? The one who has learned to tolerate misery. I don't know what to say. She's coming. His friend called in the morning with an unknown Number. I guess somewhere from South. I am not sure where he was calling from. He told they went for drug dealing. I don't know what happend. Police got there, there was shooting and then Mostafa and his friend escaped. I wish I was dead! why did you let him continue his dirty business again? Me? I did insist on keeping him away from these stuff. He lied to me as well. Now where is he? Is he ok? I don't know, his friend didn't know where he is. He told Mostafa is escapee. He was shot. My God! He doesn't stop doing this until he kills me. If I hadn't listend to dad, you wouldn't have argued with him... And now he would be alive. If I hadn't caught a cold 11 years ago... I would never have gone to drug store to see your dad there. And now I wouldn't have had you at all. If he wasn't stronger than you... He wouldn't pull the scarf off your hand and he wouldn't fall down the steps. You know how much you kicked my womb to see this world? Can I count on you till the end? I can't stand staying in this home, this neighborhood, not even this people anymore. I don't know how I tolerated this month. Since everybody has understand what the hell Mostafa did, they look at me in different way. Their look makes me sick. Do you know what I found in the basement last night? His cellphone! He hid it in the basement. I really don't know what he was thinking, he didn't want anybody's call until he was back. Kasra is suffering too. Nor I want Neither can he go to school in this neighborhood. With your permission, I decided to sell the house. I want to go to a place where nobody knows me and Kasra.
