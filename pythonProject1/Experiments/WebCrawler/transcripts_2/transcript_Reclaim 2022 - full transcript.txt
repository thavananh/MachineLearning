foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [train tracks rattling] [Ian-hsin] I still remember back when you said I was old enough to get married. You also wanted me to take care of your flower shop so I couldn't go to Paris to study art. [Chin-fang] You wanted to marry your husband. [ambient music playing] You wanted to have children. If you had insisted on studying abroad, I would have saved up some money for you. [Ian-hsin] But you never gave me any compliments. I thought you didn't like my drawings. [Chin-fang] You're the educated one. You can't even make up your own mind, but you still want the approval of others? [Ian-hsin] Who knew I could still let you down? [Chin-fang] I don't think you'd be any happier doing something else. - [music fades] - [girl humming] - [girl 2] Don't miss this one. - [girl chuckles, snorts] [girl humming] [girl 3] She has a smiling face. [girl 4] What are you guys drawing? It looks so strange! - [girl 2] We are drawing Ms. Yeh. - [indistinct chatter] [girl 4] Why does Ms. Yeh have so many heads? [boy] I'll add one more. Seven big heads! [Ian-hsin] Sign your name when you're done. [girl 3] Ms. Yeh, look what they drew. That isn't even you. [Ian-hsin] Write your name here. [girl 2] Ms. Yeh, I don't know my name. [Ian-hsin] You don't remember your name? [girl] What is your name, Ms. Yeh? [slow orchestral music playing] FIRST PLACE - [music stops abruptly] - [thud] - [male student] Hey! Watch out! - [female student] I'm so sorry. [male student] How could you be so careless? [Ian-hsin] It's okay. - Ms. Yeh? - [Ian-hsin] Hmm? Have you thought about when you're going to retire? [classical music playing] [female student] If you sell your art studio to that chain company, won't you finally be able to retire and travel the world? [classical music continues over stereo] I'm home. Do all these things on the floor need to be thrown away? [David] Yup. I had time to go through your bookcase today. I kept your painting albums and removed the miscellaneous books from the shelf. Here's my advice. Some books are best left in the store. Our place is tiny. Just keep the classy ones. [music stops] Hey, I think this is for you. [chuckles] It's Lily. Her last stop was Lisbon. Now she's back in Paris. She visited twelve cities this time. Soon I'll have a full set of European postcards. Pass me the letter opener. You said you'd take me around the world as soon as you retired. I haven't even traveled around Taiwan yet. [David] Hmm. You don't need to envy her. Thankfully, she's in good health now. When she gets older, she'll want to come back for our national healthcare. She'll find it hard to rent a house alone, and it'll be too late for regrets. It is indeed a pity to be alone when you're getting old. I went to visit Mom this... [David] Do you know how often a senior citizen is turned down for a rental? Landlords are afraid that old people will die in their house. Trust me, it's true. It's all over the news. There are old people in the park begging young people to share a house with them. Even though they offer to pay all of the rent, they can't find anyone to live with them. - [books clattering] - How's the bookcase? It looks better now that I've rearranged it, right? [classical music playing] [sighs] If you want to clear up a room every now and then, you've got to learn to let go of things. - [music stops] - [Ian-hsin] Lift up your feet. [David] Ah. It's a pension check from the labor insurance. Check if it's been deposited into my account. How much is it? About 70,000. How about transferring it to a savings account? No. What's the rush? There may be investment opportunities for some extra money. Don't forget the hundreds of teapots you bought last year. They are still stuffed inside the cabinets. Teapots will always appreciate in value. If I can't sell them, I can still use them to make tea. - What fish are we having today? - White pomfret. Well, I want it fried, okay? Why are you doing all this now? My mother always said, "If you don't work, you don't eat!" What's the point of idling at home all day? [groans] [exhales] Where's the light bulb? - The light is out in the bathroom. - Oh. [David] You're even working evenings and weekends. How much can you possibly earn from your little art class? - [train tracks rattling] - [jet engine roaring] Did you know that your cooking isn't as good as it used to be? - [accordion music playing] - Prepare two more dishes tomorrow. I want lion's head meatballs and stewed fish. [church bell tolling] - [phone ringing] - [music fades] [newscaster on TV] The building collapsed in the earthquake, killing 115 people. The construction company had allegedly cut corners. Half of the beams and pillars were faulty. The reinforcements were not strong enough to withstand earthquakes. This kind of negligence has left hundreds of lives unaccounted for. The architect that approved the building could have his license revoked and may be subject to lawsuits… What the hell is this? The developer cut corners but the architect has taken the blame. You should remind Chia-ning to be more cautious. Even though she works for a big company, every contract and approval she's signed needs to be looked at carefully. [indistinct chatter on TV] [sighs] Oh, your mom called this afternoon. She thought I was your brother and was clamoring to go home. I told her Han-hsin is not in Taiwan, that I was her son-in-law. Then she began lashing out. This morning, she wrongly accused the carer of theft and even called the police. The carer was so angry that she threatened to quit. When I arrived, my mom acted as if nothing had happened. I can't keep going back and forth like this every day. She's 85. When you're 85, you'll probably be forgetful and talk nonsense too. The doctor said that older people who live with their families feel secure and have greater emotional stability. Where would she stay? And who'd look after her? Taking care of the elderly is a long-term commitment. She is 85. How much time could she possibly have left? - [piano music playing] - Let's explore our moods today! What emotions do we all have? We have happy emotions, don't we? - What else? - Rage. Rage! Yes, sometimes we get angry. - What else? - Hilarity. Hilarity! [Chuckles] Hilarity when we read comics. - All right. What else is there? - Depression. [Ian-hsin] Okay, great. Well, let's get started. I hope you kids can express your feelings. Try to express them on the canvas. [boy] I don't know how to express myself, Ms. Yeh. Oh? Why's that? Because I wanna draw a wizard, locked up in a high tower. And he's in pain. [Ian-hsin] Ah, tell me why he's in pain. Just draw another guy beside him. It will show who's suffering more by comparison. He sees others suffer and he suffers with them? [boy 2] Draw the guy outside the tower, free, and with a bigger castle. It's been a long time since Papa passed away. Maybe we can clean up that room and use it again. Do whatever you want. I can't be bothered. [slurping] Okay, then. I'll call the cleaners tomorrow. Can you help me with the dishes after dinner? - Leave them there. I'll wash them. - [indistinct chatter] [boy] My mom said a person's feelings can't be compared to others. Why are you worrying about such a difficult idea? Yeah, why are you bothering yourself? [door unlocking] [piano music playing] [music fades] [music playing on TV] [man on TV in English] She wants us to go home. Eh! [in Mandarin] Switch over to channel 13. It's time for Deep Sea, Deep Secrets. [groans] But this is Richard Gere's first TV series. You can watch TV series online, okay? A good program like Deep Sea is hard to find. - [music stops] - [water swirling] [slow music playing on TV] [cell phone ringing] Your son is calling. Wu's son is now a tenured professor, and has a full schedule of lectures every day. Tell your son to be more ambitious. Concentrate on his dissertation and get promoted ASAP. I've spent so much money on him. He's the first Lo to get their PhD overseas. Don't make me lose face, okay? - Hi, Mom. - Hi, Chia-yu. I'm returning to Taiwan at the end of the year. - I might have an interview at NTU. - What interview? Do you remember my mentor, Professor Wu? He suggested that I apply for his position when he retires. [knocking on door] [Nai-hua] Are you ready yet? We're in a hurry. [Chia-yu] I'm talking to my mom. Be there in five. So, are you both coming back? Nai-hua will be seven months pregnant by then. Can she fly? [Chia-yu] Yup, don't worry. I'm dying for some oyster vermicelli. Could you send me some frozen ones sometime? - Thanks. See you. - [cell phone beeps] [indistinct chatter on TV] [slow music playing] [indistinct chatter] [music fades] - [birds tweeting] - [bell tinkling] You sure you want to bring your mother home? Cleaning up a room won't solve your problem. [groans] Your mother divided up her inheritance and chose to move into a nursing home. Because she didn't want to be a burden, right? That's right. She even ordered a bespoke burial shroud and prepared everything herself, just in case we got the wrong size for her. [sighs] But now, her memory is terrible. What would happen if she got lost and I wasn't there for her? What about your brother? Where is he? [insects chirping] Can my mother come and stay with us for the weekend? We could walk around and take her out for dinner. Isn't that why you cleared out Papa's room? - [slow music playing] - How do I use this function? [Ian-hsin] I guess the carer can finally have a good rest. [sizzling] [doorbell buzzing] [doorbell buzzing] [music fades] [Ian-hsin] Chia-ning? I didn't know you'd be coming today. [Chia-ning] I called several times but no one answered. [Ian-hsin] Really? Hey, busy bee. How come you had time to stop by today? I had the day off, so of course, I had to see you guys. [Ian-hsin] Go wash your hands and grab some chopsticks. What a feast. Is anyone coming to visit you? Did your company finish building that train station? When are you taking your old man to visit your company? I won't bother. Public works like these are subcontracted to different companies. I just get to supervise the platform. That still sounds good to me. The company you're working with is resourceful and full of talent. So, are there any new projects? I'm all ears. Actually, I'm working on an urban renewal project. Oh? [Chia-ning] Here, I'll show you something cool. What's this? VR. It's very popular right now. You haven't heard of it? - What? - Just put on the headset. Here. Let me help you with this. Oh! - Do you see it? - Oh! Mm. Be careful. Don't worry. I can manage. Oh. Okay. Just be careful. You can't touch it. It's all virtual. What's in front of you? [David] Uh… It's the second-floor balcony, right? Why are you planting trees here? My Green Balcony is a modern three-section compound. The balconies are staggered. Plant trees downstairs, enjoy the shade upstairs. Neighbors could grow vegetables and exchange them. Interactions lead to shared memories. Isn't that wonderful? No, no, no, it's not right. You should extend the living room to the balcony. Maximize that indoor space. Then people will think it's good value for money and pay for it. I'm more concerned about each resident's feelings. A community that feels secure will foster individuality. [sighs] Most people just want somewhere to live. And you're talking about individuality? Be realistic. [Chia-ning] Why? Once your basic needs have been met, feeling like you're understood and belong there encourages individuality. That's realistic. So when will this project be completed? I've been trying very hard to get consent from all the residents. - It'll take a while, but... - So it hasn't even kicked off yet. Man, I thought you were busy with something big. If something doesn't happen, there's always a reason for it. A plan that can't be executed is just a castle in the sky. Next time you come for dinner, let me know sooner so I can prepare more food. Oh! How come you don't need to work overtime today? I quit. Oh. And what now? Have you found a new job? Yeah, the urban renewal project I was talking about. - The labor union referred the case to me. - The labor union? - Will you be paid? - I will. Once I get consent from all the residents. Don't tell your husband yet, okay? - Of course I won't. - [both chuckle] [dishes clattering] [chair scrapes] - [Ian-hsin sighs] - [tea pouring] - Yummy. - [sighs] Didn't you always dream of being an artist? How could you settle for being a teacher? For 30 years, no less. I had to support our family. Your father had to support his brothers and sisters. When people are selfless, all of their potential is realized. If you could go back in time, would you still make the same decision? Don't you want to go to Paris? Look at your life now. You're just fulfilling one role after another. If you make the wrong choice, it always comes at a price. [Ian-hsin] Oh! So I've made the wrong choice. What's your great choice? Can I move back in and stay here for a while? [slow music playing] [gasps] I thought I'd have to sleep on the couch. [chuckles] Even the mattress is new. My own space? I couldn't ask for more. [exhales] It's so good to be home. [snores] [indistinct chatter] [indistinct chatter continues] [music fades] [upbeat music playing on TV] [Manhattan Avenue theme music playing] - [music fades] - [birds tweeting] [Chin-fang] Han-hsin! Han-hsin? Come. Help Mom bring the groceries in. [doorbell buzzing] [doorbell buzzing] [door unlocking] Excuse me. Who are you? You must be Han-hsin's friend. Take the groceries inside, will you? Don't go. Stay for lunch. Who was that? He was so rude. Mom. Han-hsin lives abroad now. This is someone else's home now. Han-hsin sold the house I gave him? [Chia-ning] If you work with a shady construction company, you're asking for trouble. Working for me is the only way you'll get paid. What's the difference between being self-employed and unemployed? How are you going to feed yourself? Our company agreed to outsource the project to you. Okay, coming! - [sighs] - Okay… No, thanks. I'm worried that the budget will be spent on kickbacks and commissions. Look out for yourself. If you don't prove your worth, who will want to hire you? Teamwork is the new black. A project like this can boost connections and credibility. We have to take what we deserve, right? You only talk about "we" when you need something from me. I have a meeting with the site manager tomorrow morning. [knocking on door] Could you keep an eye on the construction site for me? But I'm moving tomorrow. [Yu-Cheng] Well… I can't go. Just let them begin. The handover is just a formality anyway. It's no big deal. What if something goes wrong without supervision? Well, you can't go, and I have a meeting. We'll just have to rely on their experience. Or perhaps you could go to the construction site in the morning, and I could help you move in the afternoon. How's that? [Chia-ning] You promise? [sighs] [coughs] How come our girl suddenly moved back? Her roommate moved out. She didn't want to pay all the rent. But with her income, the rent should be no problem. Is something wrong? Nothing's wrong. Don't worry. The point is our girl is back home with us. I don't think it's that simple. You should find out what's happened with her job. Or is it the guy? Did they break up? I honestly don't like the guy. I don't know what our girl sees in him. Hey, don't leave the milk there. It'll turn sour. All right, just put it back for me. [indistinct chatter on TV] I'll prepare two more dishes tomorrow. Now that you're starting your own business, what are your plans with Yu-Cheng? What plans do you mean? Well, you need to prioritize things in life. Men don't have to think about pregnancy. They can work hard at any age. Women have different concerns. [chuckles] I'm not against getting married or starting a family, but I've got no money, no car, no house. I have nothing. How can I start a family? By the time you think you're ready, it might be too late. Why should I plan my life based on biological functions? Can't I realize my self-worth first and then decide what role I want to play? All right, all right. You're on your own. - Is there anything I can do for you? - Like what? Don't worry. I can take care of myself. Your daughter asked you to buy her a house? Is that what she wants? I need to do something. It'll be the end of time before she asks me. [sighs] You're right. If I hadn't gone ahead and bought my son a house, his wife wouldn't have married him. [indistinct chatter] [groans] [gasps] [real estate agent] This way, ladies. There's a well-lit kitchen. - [Hsiang gasps] What the hell? - [cat meowing] Is this a bird cage? [groans] Ouch! [cat meowing] Here's the master bedroom on the right. There's a huge walk-in closet for the lady of the house. This room is especially quiet. The man of the house could use it as a study. It's a great choice for couples with no kids. Is there an option for a double master bedroom? My daughter needs her own study too. - [music ends abruptly] - [gasps] It's not easy to find a decent house in Taipei these days for under $400,000. [birds chirping] [dramatic orchestral playing] [music stops] Ms. Yeh, your husband peed on the toilet. Oh, my. [toilet flushes] - [pigeon coos] - [screams] - [pigeon cooing] - [grunts] Come on, come on. - David! David! - Don't touch it. [Ian-hsin] There's a pigeon in the house! Don't touch it. Chung-kuei gave me a pigeon. It won a championship last year. Don't move! What? You want to keep a pigeon in the house? My goodness. You can't just leave it in the bathroom. [David grunts] Where are you going? [cooing] It's sad to keep a pigeon in a cage. Come here! Give it some space to move around. I'll build a pigeon house for it. Pigeon house? Where are you gonna put it? On the front balcony. I've already ordered some wood pallets. If you have time for the pigeon, why don't you clean up your mess? Where does all this stuff go, huh? Why rush to put things away? Did you forget? My mother is coming to stay for the weekend. Where are we supposed to put her now? These old things, can't you throw some of them away? Why should I? I can get them all fixed. They're covered in mold. You stocking up to open an antique shop? You see the piano over there? No one's playing it. - Why not sell it? - The piano is not for sale. Okay, don't clean anything, don't sell anything… The walls are moldy. These memories can only be sorted out, not thrown out. Got it? Then when can the mold be removed? When things are sorted out. - You can sort them out today. - No, I can't. - Why not? - I'm going out. Going out where? Zhang has a private hot spring resort up on Yangming Mountain. He invited me for tea. Once I find a private studio, I'll give you all the space in the house. Your mother can have any room she wants. All I need is a bed. [upbeat music playing] Oh! David will never take the stairs. Tell him that exercise burns off belly fat. Better get moving now before you can't move anymore. [Ian-hsin] If the neighbors are too noisy, he'll pick a fight with them. [Hsiang] If the neighbors are quiet, he'll pick a fight with you. This house is too old. It'll be hard to clean up. Your husband doesn't do the cleaning. What does he care? - [knocking on door] - [Ian-hsin] He needs a parking spot. He doesn't take the subway or bus. - [elevator dings] - There'd better be a recycling system. He doesn't sort the garbage. It's too small. David needs space for his antique collection. [scoffs] No, he is the antique. One minute you want a house for your daughter, the next you need a place for your husband. - Do you have too much money lying around? - [music fades] [elevator creaking] Mrs. Lo, your mom has been clamoring to go home since she woke up. She snuck out of her room when the carer went to get her lunch. By the time the carer found her, she was throwing things at people and almost broke a window. [Ian-hsin] My apologies. I'll pay for any damages. Perhaps I can hire another foreign carer? The application procedure will take at least two months. One more thing. Your mother fell down while she was struggling. She's fine now. We gave her sedatives to calm her down. We will gradually increase the dose, which means she'll be sleeping more. Please be prepared. [wind chimes tinkling] [indistinct chatter on TV] [Ian-hsin sighs] - [upbeat music playing] - [indistinct chatter] [real estate agent] Each house is at least 132 square meters. No matter if you want it for your retirement or your whole family… Be careful. In the center of this community, we have our own waste management system. You won't have to chase the garbage truck every day. We will sort the recyclables for you. This way, please. The lobby and the balcony both use non-slip building materials and they include a ramp. Over there. The height difference between the interior and exterior is under three centimeters. You won't have to worry about kids or seniors falling over. Take care. Earlier, you asked about ceiling height, so take a look. As for the interior design, we offer customized designs. You don't have to spend any more time decorating. Once you get your keys, it's ready to move into! It's also quick and easy for the elderly to move in. Sanitary fittings include the handrails for the elderly. Watch your step. Here we have a giant bookshelf. The man of the house can display his most precious collections. The toilet has a built-in auto-sensing system, so your husband won't forget to flush or lift the lid when he's done. [Chuckles] Feel free to look around. [man] So what's the price per square meter? [real estate agent] It will be $7,600 per square meter, so these homes start at one million. We have many options for you to consider… [indistinct chatter] [Hsiang] Hey. My investment advisor gave me a big-screen TV recently. I can give it to you if you need it. It's brand-new, all right? Why would your investment advisor give you a big TV for no reason? There's no such thing as a free lunch. Be careful. Don't worry. My advisor is wonderful. Even though he charges commission and consultation fees, I still get a six percent return every year. Much higher than bank interest rates. Let me ask you something. Have you ever taught a student named Li Kuan-ting? When we drove past your art studio last week, he said he used to join your family dinners when he was a kid. Li Kuan-ting? Yes, I remember him. He moved abroad with his family over a decade ago. Correct. That student of yours is now my investment advisor. - [chuckles] - [gasps, chuckles] Remember I told you I got a good return? I bought the house on his recommendation. [phone ringing] Mrs. Chen's receipt has been filed. She transferred $160,000 yesterday. Confirm and buy her shares in Nongbao Co. Oh. Thank you. Ma'am, your investment in green energy has just produced returns. Tell me how you'd like them managed. Let me see. [Kuan-ting] And there's this. The money I borrowed from you last time, plus interest. My goodness! An eight percent interest rate. You can always borrow money from me. I always return what I borrow. So, you got any investment ideas that will excite me? I've only got high-risk ones. Are you sure you want to play? Kuan-ting, is this what you eat every day? I work at least 12 hours a day and barely have time to eat. Come have dinner at my place tonight. Scrambled eggs with shrimp? - Piece of cake. [Chuckles] - I can't make it. I have to visit my daughter at her postpartum care center. It's $300 a day, and I'm footing the bill. [car horns honking] This area costs on average $25,500 per square meter. - [upbeat music playing] - But this one only costs $16,000. - How many square meters is this place? - 116 square meters. So, 116 square meters times 16,000… Hmm. This is a basement, but you can turn it into an art studio, just like in New York. - And it'll have such a cool vibe. - [Hsiang] This place is huge! But there's no sunlight here. You couldn't even grow any flowers. I'm sure Chia-ning wouldn't like it. Then let's keep looking. We're only one minute away from the subway station. And there is a school nearby. You can either live here or rent it out. [cell phone ringing] For a location like this, you'll easily get a loan. - You're my sixth group of clients today. - [in English] What's up? [man on phone] Uni Sino Tech is going public. [in Mandarin] What a convenient location! [man on phone in English] They're asking me to get buyers… - [cell phone ringing] - [Chin-fang in Mandarin] Where are you? - I have to go home and cook. - [Ian-hsin] Mom, what's wrong? [Chin-fang] Han-hsin will be coming too. - Didn't you say you were coming? - Kinda small, though. - [Ian-hsin] Yeah, I'm busy. - How much is this? - [Chin-fang] When will you pick me up? - $715,000! - I'll be there tomorrow morning. - [Chin-fang] How about the old hen? They don't sell old hens in the afternoon. I'll go to Dongmen Market, and bring over the chicken for your soup. [Kuan-ting in English] So, what's that got to do with me? [man on phone] I am going with 40 million. I can get you to shoulder 20 mil if you're interested. You should just let me handle all 40. You should've called me earlier. [man on phone] Twenty is all I can do right now, but I can guarantee that in six months their stock will appreciate at least five times. [Chia-ning in Mandarin] I have enough rice. [David] Have some more vegetables. [Kuan-ting] Thanks, Mr. Lo. - Mm. More rice? - How could I resist? Let me do it. When I was a kid, my mom was too busy to cook. So I always looked forward to having dinner at Ms. Yeh's. [chuckles] When did you come back? What have you been up to lately? After finishing my degree, I came back to help my dad. Now I've started a small company, making some investments. [Ian-hsin] Hmm. [Kuan-ting] I make money from the commission. I haven't seen your parents in ages. - How are they doing? - Good. - What about Chia-yu? - He got married in the States. He's about to get tenure. - Wow, that's cool. - [cell phone chiming] Oh. Excuse me. Kuan Yuan Investment Company. Great, it's a promising career. - What do you invest in? - Stocks, funds, real estate. Anything I can make money from, really. Anything worth investing in lately? We have a pre-IPO that's going public soon. We estimate that its price may increase by three to five times in six months. I'm betting everything on this one to make a huge profit. So it's unlisted stock? - Pretty risky, huh? - No investment is risk-free. But my buddy's managing the project and he's the VP of an investment bank. - Insider trading? - [Kuan-ting] Mm. Is it safe? [claps] Great news! My urban renewal project is about to begin. I just got consent from all the property owners. Oh. When I'm rich and successful, I'll build houses for you, - one house per person. - [chuckles] - [Kuan-ting] That'd be pretty cool. - [chuckles] I don't have the courage to deal with urban renewal. [birds chirping] [Kuan-ting] Ms. Yeh, this one is exclusively for you. You'll fall in love with it. [upbeat music playing] Whether you want to live here yourself or rent it out, it's a one-in-a-million opportunity. It sure is. If I were you, I would buy this one for my daughter. The owner is an old client of mine. It's been vacant for years. Now it's finally for sale. And they will only sell it to someone who will cherish this house. I can't see any problems with it. I'll take care of the price. - This one is really good. - [Hisiang] Hmm. Give it to Chia-ning so she can start her own family. And my mom can move in too. If you give it to David, he can put all of his scrap metal here. [Hisiang] So, who exactly is this house for? - You really are your own worst enemy! - [suspenseful music playing] I wouldn't have come if I knew I had to climb up to the fifth floor. This house is perfect, but these stairs will destroy my knees. And if us old people trip on the stairs, just imagine! - [music fades] - [cell phone ringing] [nurse] Hello, Mrs. Lo? Your mom got out and fell on the street. [clock ticking] [indistinct chatter] [slow music playing] Mom? [indistinct chatter] - [grunts] - [woman] Pay more attention! If you get lost, how will you find your way home? [indistinct chatter] [young Ian-hsin] Mom, will you buy chicken today? [Chin-fang] It's not Chinese New Year yet. Why would we buy chicken? Stay close. Hurry up. Stay close. Don't get lost. [indistinct chatter] [young Ian-hsin] Hmm. Mom? Mom? [vendor] Ma'am, check out the fresh seafood today! [Chin-fang] My daughter is allergic to fish. What else do you have? [indistinct chatter] How much for a tablecloth? - [vendor] Ten dollars. - [Chin-fang] I'll take one, please. - And the apron? - Twenty-five. [Chin-fang] What a rip-off! It's not like it's a lot of fabric. It is made of cutting-edge material. It's water, ink, and paint splash resistant. You can wear it when you're cooking or painting. [Chin-fang] No tablecloth then. Give me two aprons, please. One red, one blue. - How's 40? - Huh? [Chin-fang] My daughter can wear it while she's painting. - Deal. Thanks. - [Chin-fang] Thank you very much. - Hi, ma'am. - [vendor] Hi! [Chin-fang] Did you save an old hen for me? [vendor] Of course. I knew you were coming today, so I saved one for you earlier. You have no idea how many people asked for one today. [Chin-fang] Thank you. Chicken soup is my daughter's favorite, and your chicken is the best in town. Happy? [vendor] Ma'am, you forgot your chicken. - [music fades] - [indistinct chatter] Oh! Thank you. [horn honking] [Yu-Cheng] Miss Lo, what's wrong with you? You're not answering my calls or replying to my messages. [in English] Hey! Hello! [in Mandarin] You couldn't even keep your promise that you'd help me move. [Yu-Cheng] I have a job, missy. Is my only role helping you move? So, what is my role? - [tires screech] - [pulls handbrake] Why are you here, anyway? You want to start your own business, that's fine with me. You should either be a consultant and do admin, or work closely with the builders and make some money. I was worried you didn't have a job, so I referred projects to you. I have what I care about. My job takes time, too. Why do I have to go with your plan, and do everything you say? What's wrong with you? Is your job more important than mine? Aren't you here to ask me to help with your project? What if I didn't listen to you? [drilling, hammering in the distance] [car door opens] [sighs] - [car door closes] - [engine starts] [tires screech] [pigeon cooing] [Ian-hsin] I'm home. Why are we having boxed lunches? The heat outside is killing me. Help yourself. I'll fix you some more food later. [exhales] The awning downstairs is broken. Someone will get hurt if it's ripped off. That's the building's business. Stop meddling with it. About the antiques Papa left behind… - Aren't there also some paintings? - Oh! Didn't you tell me to put them in Chia-yu's room? Listen, my mom snuck out again today and she fell. - I'm thinking... - Hello, dear. Janet, good to see you. You have boxed lunches? I was looking forward to your famous braised pork belly. [chuckles] By the way, I've ordered the offerings for Tomb Sweeping Day. Let him know the day before you need them. Thank you. If you ask my opinion, cemetery business is kind of creepy. Why don't you take care of the hotpot restaurant first? Are you here for Papa's antiques? - Yes. Thank you. - No problem. [chuckles] [Janet] My dear brother, the hotpot restaurant is one thing. That's out of date. What matters now is this Life and Cultural Creative Park. It's the latest trend. It's not just a place for the departed to rest, but also a recreational space for the living to expand their social circles. Think about it. Who is capable enough to secure a spot there? Entrepreneurs, doctors, lawyers. The most successful and privileged! But what defines wealth and status? Nowadays, wealth is simply a display of a family's cultural bearings. Their taste in literature and art, right? Once you set foot in this place, I guarantee that you'll make connections way faster than in Rotary Clubs and such. Take a look. This is the art gallery. The gallery will be exclusively for the wealthy and celebrities to hold exhibitions and art auctions. And this is the concert hall. The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra will be invited to play every July to feed the heaven and spirits with music! Here you are. Thank you so much. [whispering] Don't make any rash investment decisions. [cell phone ringing, vibrates] Chia-yu? [Chia-yu] Mom, can you book my flight back to Taiwan? The flights I mentioned the other day are all fully booked. I thought the school would take care of that. [Chia-yu] The TA didn't act fast enough. I'll send you the new times. Can you please help? Send me an email when you're done. - And keep the receipt for me. - Okay. Hey, dear, I don't think it's any of these. But I'm fine with taking them too. Didn't Papa have a painting of an orchid? He promised to leave it for me a long time ago. - If she can't find it, that's it. - [doorbell buzzing] - Hello? - [delivery man] Package for Lo Chia-ning. Okay. I'll be right there. - Oh, your package has arrived. - Can you pick it up for me? Uh, can you also help me find that gray shirt? All right. That's $460 cash on delivery. $460? Sorry. Just give me a minute. Since you're done moving, you should go back to work. You're taking too much time off, you'll soon be isolated. - I can work from anywhere. - [door closing] [Janet] Bro, times are changing. Girls have their own opinions now. Lo Chia-ning, what on earth did you order that costs $460? Go downstairs and pay for it. [Janet] Let's get back to our conversation. The living who go to worship their ancestors have basic needs. Therefore, Tomb Sweeping should be as enjoyable as going on vacation. Look at these Balinese-style villas in front of the lake. - [doorbell buzzing] - [Janet] On the other side, you can see a 100-meter infinity pool. - [doorbell buzzing] - [Janet] One should go somewhere pleasant to face the ultimate fate of death. Who would stay at a miserable place that's filled with fear? - [doorbell buzzing] - [Janet] Take a look. This pool has a clear bottom. Right beneath it is the Inner Core Memorial Hall… - Hello? - [delivery man] How much longer? She's not downstairs yet? Sorry, I'll be right there! [Janet] There's no boundary between darkness and light. Life and death coexist in the same dimension. [Chuckles] Don't you think it's a perfect ending… - [knocks on door] - …for a life's journey? Why do you always keep others waiting? We only have 24 hours in a day. Someone will always be waiting. Who is going to wait for me? The delivery man is! What's this fancy thing that cost you $460? A graphics tablet. Could you help me out for now? Okay. You're wearing this later, all right? Do you ever feel that you're whole when you're alone, but fall apart when you're with someone else? - [doorbell buzzing] - [indistinct chatter] Don't be silly! [Janet] The market is worth $2.5 billion per year. It's been appreciating faster than housing for the living! We can get a 20% discount now, but availability will decrease rapidly. I say forget it. It's nothing but multi-level marketing. How long could this last? I doubt it'll last any longer than your hotpot restaurant. Since we're renovating the graves of Papa, Mama and our ancestors, why don't we move them to this cemetery? Relocating the grave is one thing. Investment is another. Yes, I agree they should be considered separately. But I'm sure you're also waiting for your antique collection to appreciate. Investment requires solid financial backing. Who would take you seriously otherwise? People who have money can call their own shots while sitting at home. [Chia-ning] I'm off. [Janet] You have an excellent son and daughter, unlike me. My son is still fooling around after graduating from a third-rate college. [David] It's up to them to work hard. I won't be home for dinner. I'm meeting a client. Ian, any sign of that orchid painting? Ah. I'll keep looking. Papa used to say you were the wisest one in the Lo family and told me to talk to you whenever I was in need. Without you, my life would be miserable. No one would disagree that you are the sole pillar of the Lo family. [sighs] [Janet] Brother, there is nothing you couldn't do or weren't allowed to do. Not only can you profit from this park, but most importantly, you can ensure support for the family. - Is this the one? - Yes, that's the one! Thanks. Can I have a bag? I'd better get going. I have an appointment with the lawyer. I'll leave the brochures here. Think about it when you have time, all right? Thank you so much. I got it. [cell phone ringing] Hello, son. [Chia-yu] Mom, have you booked my flight yet? - See you. - No, not yet. [Chia-yu] Could you also prepare my room for me? Don't forget to replace the single bed with a double. You guys are going to stay here too? - All right. I'll book your flight first. - [Chia-yu] Thank you, Mom. - Did you deposit that $70,000 yet? - Why do you ask? This "housing for the dead" thing actually sounds interesting. Who will use that cemetery? It's for the future. Just in case Chia-yu and Chia-ning don't know where to bury us. Do you have any idea whose housing need is more urgent? What did I tell you when I got home? You said you couldn't make lunch in time, so eat the boxed lunch first. [sighs] [train tracks rattling] [alarm beeping] [rattling and alarm stop] I'm going to prepare the contract. Please take a seat. And the building permit, please. - Of course, just a second. - Thanks. [Ian-hsin chuckles] Thank you so much, Kuan-ting. I got this fantastic discount all because of you. It was nothing. I've been house-hunting for a while. Out of all the properties I've seen, this one is the most suitable for seniors. Hmm. So the $800,000 purchase price minus the $200,000 down payment… Say you take a $600,000 mortgage, the monthly payment will be at least $2,700. - You okay with that? - Yes. I guess I'll just have to keep on working. [chuckles] [cell phone ringing] Be right back. [cell phone ringing] [in English] Give me good news? [man on phone] I had a perfect steak for lunch. Hey, what? - [man on phone] I do have good news. - You do? [man on phone] I got you another ten million. Oh, shit. [man on phone] But they will need the money by the end of the week. - You good? - Yeah, no problem. - [man on phone] You got it covered? - Yeah, I got it. [man on phone] Make sure you deliver. [in Mandarin] So, the deposit and down payment, when you sign the contract, it accounts for ten percent of the overall total. Here it is. - $80,000. - Hmm. - Everything okay so far? - Yes. This is the reservation form. Once you pay us the deposit, we will hold this house for you. Please sign here. It'll take us 20 days to assess the contract. If everything looks good, we will arrange for the official signing. Okay. I want to learn more about the kitchen and bathroom design. Sure. I'll go grab the catalog. - Great. - Just a moment. - Thank you. - [real estate agent] No problem. [Kuan-ting] How's it going? [Grunts] All done. Ms. Yeh, do you remember the stock I mentioned before? The one that's going public? Oh, yeah. You said that your friend has insider information. That once the buyers are on board, their stock price will shoot up. Mm. That's right. In fact, the real estate market is slowing down lately. There are so many new properties in this area alone. This one sold less than 80% of the units. Here's my advice. You may as well wait a while. Think about it. For six months, you can use this money as an investment and buy your home when the principal doubles. But, Kuan-ting, I know nothing about investment. And I'm afraid my mom can't wait much longer. But the truth is, you don't have enough money right now. If you have such a high mortgage, think about it, the bank interest alone would be tens of thousands. But if you lend me that $200,000, I will pay back $70,000 in three weeks' time, which will cover your down payment. And in six months, it would be double. Then you'll have enough money for sure and you'll be able to retire sooner. - [chuckles] - [Chinese music playing] - [drilling in the distance] - [music fades] [Chia-ning] Mr. Ting, the man who first suggested the urban renewal project, has died. His son is now persuading the residents to work with big companies! My former boss is one of those developers. Why are other companies joining in now? Haven't you been working on this for nine months? How should I know? The developers must have bribed Mr. Ting. My project is tailored to all the proprietors… And has almost cost me all my savings. What are you gonna do now? You've spent so much time and money. You can't just give up now. I went to some banks to ask for a loan, but I was rejected by all of them. However, I did receive text messages from private loan companies offering to lend me money. They're loan sharks. Don't even think about it. Is it possible to collaborate with your former boss? If they're still interested. You have a complete design now. You could use their name and financial backing to pull off this project and keep your own design. You don't necessarily have to start your own firm and deal with everything by yourself. It's impossible. How can you be so naive? They will definitely change my design to make a greater profit. [Ian-hsin] Hmm. What did Yu-Cheng say? I thought he was a pro at negotiations and business? You guys used to work together on every project. - What's his opinion on this? - We broke up. [Cries] It's just me now. [Sniffs] None of you believe in me. [sniffs] Oh, look how miserable you are. You're getting older. No job. No boyfriend. No money, but still eats a lot. [chuckles] You have food all over your face. [Chuckles] - What should we do about this poor lady? - You are so mean. [sniffs] I just don't want to give in and go back to my old ways. I want to explore something different. [sighs] I can do this! I'm just short of money. Nobody has faith in me, anyway. I believe in you! No need to cry. Do whatever you have to do. As for money, let Mom take care of that. [alarm blaring] Mom, my bill will be overdue soon. The budget proposal needs to be bound in red. And don't forget to mail the project report today. - Got it. - I'm off to the construction site. [soft music playing] [door closing] Chung-kuei forgot to tell me one thing. Pigeons just wait to be disposed of, once they have competed. [Ian-hsin] I won't be home for lunch, but the food has been cooked, and I included your favorite turnip soup. Take out the trash when you have time, okay? Don't be gone too long. - [door closing] - [music fades] [machines whirring] Excuse me, where can I find Ms. Lo? Oh, try the tenth floor of that building. [Chia-ning] For the main pipe, use 25mm instead of 20mm. If it fails the water pressure test, you'll have to redo it anyway. And for the powdered cement, you guys only applied three layers. We asked for six layers, so it should be six layers. This is the area on each floor. Here and also in building B. Please keep an eye out during construction and follow the contract. [Mandarin song playing] [song fades] [door closes] [keys jingle] [Chia-ning] Your favorite show Manhattan Avenue is about to start. - [chuckles] - [Ian-hsin] Wow! Where did you get this? Kuan-ting delivered it this afternoon. Now you have your own TV to watch Richard Gere on. [both chuckle] [upbeat music playing on TV] Look! Neither of us have changed yet. We're so scruffy. Weren't you always skeptical about investments and dividends? How did Kuan-ting convert you? [indistinct chatter on TV] Now you are your own North Star. Even if you fall, you need to help yourself up. - Mm-hmm. - [chuckles] I found an office right near the neighborhood. I'll be moving out soon. Then you can bring Grandma home. Oh! Thank God you haven't opened those boxes. [Chuckles] What would I do without you? Thank you, Ms. Yeh! Oh, it's on! [Manhattan Avenue theme music playing] [chuckles] [music fades] Oh! You got a new TV? It's 4K! Hey. Don't block my view. Come here if you want to watch. Where's my gray suit? [Ian-hsin] Still at the dry cleaners, I suppose. Never mind, I'll wear something else. [Ian-hsin] What's the occasion? Eason is doing a VR project with some former colleagues. There will be a crowd funding presentation this Friday for investors. - I'd like to go. - Hmm. It sounds promising. Much better than investing in housing for the dead. You do look rather dashing in that gray suit. I'll go pick it up tomorrow. Don't bother. I look good in anything. - [chuckles] - [groans] [cell phone dinging] $70,000 HAS BEEN DEPOSITED TO YOUR ACCOUNT [cell phone dinging] MS. YEH, I'VE TRANSFERRED THE MONEY. FRIDAY IS THE LAST DAY FOR THE DEPOSIT. LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANY HELP. KUAN-TING. - [David] Who is it? - Kuan-ting. Let me ask you something. If we buy a bigger house… And everyone has their own room, would everyone be happy? [scoffs] Isn't it obvious? So, have you found my study? I saw a new house. All our families could live together. There's an elevator, four rooms, two bathrooms - and a centralized recycling system. - [ambient music playing] How much does it cost? About $800,000. I shouldn't have retired. [sighs] I could've worked for a couple more years. [chuckles] [indistinct chatter] - [alarm blaring] - [music fades] Last year I told you to buy shares, but you wouldn't. Then the election came and changed everything. Now you'd better act fast. The political wind is shifting again. If you aren't proactive this time… Well, let's pray that you won't regret it. [chuckles, groans] That Kuan-ting boy borrowed $70,000 from me a few days ago. He will give me a 12 percent interest rate this time. - I really want to lend him all my money. - [chuckles] You're an evil loan shark! Be thankful that Kuan-ting is a man of his word. He just paid me back the down payment for the new house. [line ringing] [automated voice] You will be transferred to voicemail. Please leave your message after the beep. Please hang up if you do not wish to leave a message. If you want to skip the system instructions… - [takes deep breath] - [cell phone beeps] [line ringing] [automated voice] You will be transferred to voicemail. - Please begin at the sound of the beep. - [cell phone beeps] Kuan-ting, this is Ms. Yeh. Please call me back when you get this. [cell phone beeps] [siren blaring in the distance] [chuckles] This is great. You're standing on your own two feet. When you build your own house, I will be your first client. Actually, it's quite likely. If I work with the developers, we can potentially kick off the renewal project next year. I believe the residents will choose you at the end of the day. Don't worry. The developers also have a piece of land next to mine that will become a big urban renewal project. Yu-Cheng told me that he took the project with my former boss. So have you two made up? If we put the two pieces of land together, the renewal project could lead to greater possibilities. [Ian-hsin] Oh. As long as Yu-Cheng can respect your decision, and you don't need to compromise to boost profit, then it's great. Yu-Cheng will handle the negotiations and the budget. If I work with him and the developers, I won't need to use your pension, and you can retire earlier. Remember how you told me that we need to keep fulfilling our roles? What if… We choose the wrong paths, and then we suffer the consequences? You don't believe in me, do you? That's why you never stop worrying about me. No, it's not because I don't believe in you. I just don't want you to be unhappy. So, are you happy? At least when I want something, I don't pretend that I do it for other people's sake. [door closes] [alarm blaring] [beeping] [card machine beeps] Your card is not working. Cash, please. Cash, please. - [coins clattering] - [Ian-hsin groans] I'm sorry. [beeping stops] KUAN-TING [line ringing] [automated voice] You will be transferred to voicemail. Please leave your message after the beep. Please hang up if you do not wish to leave a message. If you want to skip the system instructions… [door closes] [keys jingling] [sighs] [sighs] [cell phone ringing] CHIA-YU - Hi, Chia-yu. - [Chia-yu] Hey, Mom. I've been thinking about something and I need your opinion. [Chia-yu] What is it? I found a nice place in Taipei. If you come back here to teach, you can sell your house over there and buy this one. It's a big house, and it has an elevator. I could also bring your grandma home and we could all live together. Then I will be able to take care of all of you. What do you think? [Chia-yu] Actually, Nai-hua and I both think that an over-competitive city life won't be good for our kid. Nai-hua's parents own land in Hualien. We're thinking about selling our current place, and I can become a farmer in rural Taiwan. A farmer? [Chia-yu] I could continue doing my field study. What about everything we've done for you? You'd just throw all of it away? Your job at the school, your professorship… You want to give all that up too? You should seriously reconsider this. [Chia-yu] I thought you would understand. I thought you'd be more open-minded than other parents. Well, I guess that's it. I'm kind of busy. Bye. [cell phone beeps] [door closes] [sighs] [beeps] [bubbling] - [sizzling] - [gasps] [groans] [David sighs] The house you mentioned last time… Who's it for? For us. Maybe my mom can come live with us too. I think that buying a house right now… Is unrealistic. It's not that urgent. Did everything go well today? I want to open a VR club. I can talk to the manufacturers of all the famous brands. My old colleagues can't keep up with me. I thought you were gonna work with Eason? No need. Say, you and I should pick a day for that home viewing. I'm sure you will love it. Chia-ning is busy with her own career. In the future, when Chia-yu and his kid leave Hualien and move back to Taipei, - they can live with... - Wait, what? What do you mean, "leave Hualien and move back to Taipei"? Chia-yu and Nai-hua are moving back to Taiwan. They're going back to Nai-hua's hometown to work there as farmers and live a healthy life. When did they tell you this? - Did no one think to tell me this? - I'm telling you now. They're coming back to Taiwan. Why didn't you tell me this earlier? I wasn't asked about it. Where do I stand in this family? You guys make all the decisions. How can we afford a new place? Where's the money gonna come from? What do we do with this place? Did you even discuss any of this with me? Do you even care what I think? Why do you think I don't respect you? We worked so hard for so many years to pay for Chia-yu's education abroad. And this is how he shows his gratitude? All my life, I've saved every penny for our family. I'm still eating this cheap fish, even after I've retired. - What did you spend our money on? - [sighs] I'm going out. We'll talk about this later. We're not finished. Don't you leave! Let me ask you this. You want your mom to move in, but how are you gonna look after her? I took care of your father when he moved in. - Why can't I look after my mom? - Okay. How are you gonna buy that house? How will you pay the mortgage? Did you think about any of this? What are we going to buy a house with? Do we have that kind of money? From now on, I'll be the one in charge of the bank books and stamps. [line ringing] [Ian-hsin] Kuan-ting, this is Ms. Yeh. Call me when you get this, please. [automated voice] You will be transferred to voicemail. Please leave your message after the beep. Please hang up if you do not wish to leave a message… [Hsiang] If the police seize the assets and seal the boxes, then we lose everything. [client 1] You're right. [client 2] If he's making a living off dividends, he probably already fled the country with the money. - [indistinct chatter] - If he was also scammed, then he'll have nothing to pay us back with. [client 3] He still owes me two payments. [client 4] If his account is frozen, you can't get the money back, even if you hire a lawyer. [Kuan-ting] If you have such a high mortgage, the bank interest alone would be tens of thousands. But if you lend me that $200,000, in six months, I will pay you back double. Then you'll have enough money for an early retirement. [David] You want your mom to move in, but how are you gonna look after her? [suspenseful music playing] - [indistinct chatter] - [cell phone ringing] [nurse] Hello, Mrs. Lo? Your mom got out and fell on the street… [David] I'm still eating cheap fish, even after I've retired. What did you spend our money on? You guys make all the decisions. How are you gonna pay the mortgage? How can we afford… [Chia-ning] Are you happy? [David] Did you think about any of this? [Chia-ning] At least when I want something, I don't pretend I do it for other… [David] From now on, you're not allowed to touch our family's money. - [exhales] - [alarm blaring] [music fades] [somber music playing] [music fades] [snores] [train tracks rattling] Hey. This was the first house your dad and I had in Taiwan. - Do you still remember it? - Of course I remember. I flipped through those old photo albums about a million times. [chuckles] No, no, no. You drew it the wrong way round. - The port was to the left of our house. - It was on the right. It was on the left. Are you saying that you remember it better than I do? [chuckles] - [bell ringing] - [indistinct chatter] [slow music playing] [birds chirping] All right, stop looking. It's to the left. Hey! No, the GPS says it's to the right. The roads must have changed. Mom, do you remember that there used to be a row of cement townhouses along the harbor? Dad's friend owned the consignment store, that first building on the left. It was filled with imported goods that the sailors brought back. There was a silk scarf that Dad bought you. Do you remember it? I accidentally made a hole in it, and you fixed it with a sticker. It lasted more than ten years. [Chin-fang] How come I remember none of this? [Ian-hsin chuckles] What else? Do you remember Dad's favorite Paris Night perfume? You always dabbed some behind your ears before you went out. Oh, you sure have a good memory. Hey. After we pass the stone wall, you'll see our house! Not stone, brick. It's a stone wall. [sizzling] [Yu-Cheng] I've taken over the project. It'll go smoothly from now on. Let's take a look. On the first floor, it would be better if the floor area ratio is higher than what's mandated by law. You'd be on the first floor and have more say than those above you. I'll make sure that the calculation is right for you. [cat meows] - [cat meows] - See, Mom, it's a stone wall. [music fades] I still remember back when you said I was old enough to get married. You wanted me to take care of your flower shop, so I couldn't go to Paris to study art. Stop fooling yourself. Your memory has issues. You wanted to marry your husband. You wanted to have children. If you had insisted on studying abroad, I would have saved up some money for you. But you never gave me any compliments. I thought you didn't like my drawings. What do I know? You're the educated one. You can't even make up your own mind, but you still want the approval of others? Who knew I could still let you down? I don't think you'd be any happier doing something else. [Ian-hsin] Mom, do you miss Dad? [Chin-fang sighs] I've already thought about him thousands of times when I've needed to. It's been a few decades now. I don't even remember what he looks like. [Ian-hsin] Mom, what's your deepest fear? [Chin-fang] Me? I fear nothing. I'm just afraid that you're not happy. How about you? [Ian-hsin] I'm afraid of getting old. I'm afraid of losing you when I grow old and of being alone. [Chin-fang] All of us are alone when we reach the end. It's nothing to be scared of. Mom, how come you never remarried? Wasn't it hard for you to raise us on your own? No, because you guys helped me realize my full potential. Furthermore, I could give you a full family life all on my own. But I thought Dad was your everything. [sighs] No, it's always your call to make. You get to decide what is everything to you. One day, when your needs fall back on your own shoulders… Your husband will be no more than a painting on your wall. [music fades] [NASA launch commentator, in English] Separation confirmed. Discovery's guidance is now converging as the shuttle's on board computers fine tune the flight. Twenty-five seconds into the flight, Discovery traveling 3,189 mph. Its altitude, 37 miles. Down range from the Kennedy Space Center, 53 miles. Discovery now getting a boost into orbit… [inhales] [in Mandarin] Pigs don't eat eggshells! If you don't sort your garbage, we won't take it. Go! [keys jingling] [alarm blaring] [light-hearted music playing] [alarm fades] [exhales] [clicks] 6,000,000 DOLLARS AUTHORIZED SIGNATURE: YEH LAN-HSIN [sighs] [Chin-fang] Ian-hsin. - [Chin-fang] Ian-hsin. - [music fades] It's time to wake up. We're almost at the airport. Mom, I had a really weird dream. [slow orchestral music playing over headphone] [chuckles] [music fades] - Mom, do you need to use the washroom? - No, I'm fine. - You sure? I'm going to the washroom. - [indistinct chatter] I'll be back in a minute. Wait here, okay? - Don't get lost. - How could I? Don't get lost yourself. Go, go, go. [Ian-hsin] Don't go anywhere. [indistinct announcement over PA system] [Chin-fang] Hurry up! [ambient music playing] Excuse me. Have you seen an elderly lady wearing a long beige dress? Please check with customer service. - It's over there. - Thank you. [pants] [indistinct chatter] [music fades] [sighs] Miss, my mother is missing. Could you please help me page her? - Sure. What's her name? - Sun Chin-fang. She's 85 years old, and she's about this tall. She has short gray hair. I'm asking for your name. It's all right. Take a seat and think for a moment. I'll make the announcement. [woman over PA] Ms. Sun Chin-fang. Ms. Sun Chin-fang. Your daughter is looking for you. If any passengers or team members see an 85-year-old woman wearing a beige dress, please let her know that her nameless daughter - is waiting for her at Lost and Found. - [indistinct chatter] [woman] Shu-hui! Here you are. What took you so long? There was a long line in the washroom. I've been waiting for you for so long. [woman 2] Honey! - They've made the call for boarding. - Sorry. Let's hurry up. [woman 3] Sonia, why are you still here? It's late. [man] Lee Yi-fen, have you been waiting long? [indistinct chatter] [Ian-hsin] Mrs. Lo? Sister-in-law? Ms. Yeh? Daughter-in-law? Wife? Daughter? Mother? [Chin-fang] You're doing great. I'm so proud of you. [music fades] - [PA system dings] - [Ian-hsin] Mom. [somber music playing] [Ian-hsin] Yeh Ian-hsin. [car horn honking] My name is Yeh Ian-hsin. [soft music playing] Thank you, Mom. I'm not afraid anymore. I'll take care of myself. You don't have to worry. [music fades] [birds chirping] [door unlocking] [keys jingling] [Chia-ning] That's weird. Where's my stack of bank papers? Mom, has my white dress been washed? I don't know. Call the dry cleaner's and check. Oh. I had a really weird dream last night. What kind of dream? I dreamed about you and Grandma. I couldn't fall asleep again after I woke up. It's all good. Ms. Yeh, did you know… That for me, as long as you're here, there's no such thing as trouble. Your dress is on the far left of your closet. [sniffs] [sighs] [cell phone ringing] CHIA-YU [cell phone ringing] - [chuckles] - [cell phone ringing] I went out this morning to get your favorite food. It's in the fridge. Strawberry cake? Um… Are we having fish today? [Ian-hsin] There's no fish today. [chuckles] [sizzling] [piano music playing] [music fades] [sniffs] Hmm. Weird. Your mom's over-easy eggs are the best. - Very yummy. - [Chia-ning] Mm. Mom, Kuan-ting called. He said he's seen another new house and asked if you wanted to see it. [ambient music playing] [male student] Ms. Yeh, have you thought about when you're going to retire? [light switch clicks] [light switch clicks] [music fades] [soft music playing] [music fades] - Dad, why are you standing here? - How come you're back already? Mom's not back yet? You don't have the key either? I guess we'll wait for your mother. Mr. Lo, I've got a toolbox. - What tools do you need? - Do you have any wire? Let me check. - Cut a piece for me. - Okay. [neighbor] It should've been repaired a long time ago. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
