[bell keeps tolling] Frank, Lesby, how's the boy? - Fine, Deek. Fine. [bell keeps tolling] [horse clomping] [bell keeps tolling] [door creaking] - [Deek] Sara? [bell keeps tolling] [wind whistling] [Deek] My horse is gone. [door creaking] She took my boy with her. [suspenseful music] [horse whinnies] [yells] Sara! Sara! [gunshot] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [horse clomping] [horse whinnies] [Sara] No! No! [rifle cocks] [Sara] Please! [gun firing] [man yells] [dramatic music] [rifle cocks] Please, Deek! [Sara] No! [sobbing] [dramatic music] [gun cocks] [gunshot] [Deek yells] [upbeat music] [wind whistling] [horse snorts and whinnies] [wind whistling] [groans] [groans] [rattlesnake rattling] [baby crying] [rattlesnake rattling] [baby crying] [rattlesnake rattling] [whipcracking] [whipcracking] [John] What a young fella like you doing out here? Nah, don't think so. You just have to learn to choose your toys more carefully, that's all. Here! Watch! Cut this out, this is the end you want. Here you go. Here. [chuckles] Here that. [rattling sound] [John] That's what you wanted all along, isn't it boy? Now, it seems you have to come with me, don't you? Oh, yes, the two of us can have a fine time running across the desert. You like that idea, boy? First, I have to give your mother a decent funeral. A man's Christian duty. [somber music] [John] Someday you'll realize how lucky you are. To have been born in America. Yes, sir. Very lucky indeed. [light music] Keep digging, my boy. Someday we'll get out of this damn desert forever. We'll build our own cemetery. Somewhere far away from here. [rattling sound] Keep digging. Keep digging, my boy. [Johnny voiceover] So I spent my childhood digging. I came to realize-- how much I owe this strange but kind old man. He's a gravedigger so-- we have to ride from town to town picking up the dead. He gave me his name. John Applebee. And he tried his best to make a man of me. Gave me an education of sorts. And a gun. And here we are. Here I am still digging away. - 80-- 84. well, that's-- at $30 a head, that's $2,500. Not bad, huh? Well, aren't you pleased? - When are we going to catch 'em in? - [John] Now, don't start that again. - For every corpse, we get a piece of paper. - Johnny, this is just as good as silver. And when this war is over, the government will back this up 100% . - When is the war gonna be over? [John] Oh, who can answer a question like that? - Well, what if the other side will win the war. [John] Oh, what if it does? It's same difference. The dead are all alike. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, they don't ever have a penny on 'em. [chuckles] - Yeah, that's true. The dead can't take it with them. The living see to that. You know? Remember that fellow that carried his entire fortune in his mouth? 30 beautiful, golden, dirty teeth. Those were the good old days. But with this war, men have lost respect for everything. [rattlesnake rattling] [intense dramatic rattling] [intense dramatic rattling] [rattlesnake rattling] [intense dramatic rattling] [gunshot] [wind whistling] [Johnny voiceover] Every time I hear the sound of a rattlesnake, I-- I have the sound of death inside me. And-- I'm afraid I'll have to kill-- or be killed. [intense dramatic rattling] I wonder why. [light music] [Johnny voiceover] Often the old man and I come on hard times There's no corpses to bury, no money for food. The old man, he's figured a way out. These corpses we need to get by on. Why, that's part of his plan. - Ohhh. - Well, Johnny, there it is. [suspenseful music] [bell tolls] Be careful. [metal rattling] [intense dramatic rattling] [gun clicks] [chuckles] [chuckles] - Think you're funny, huh? But let's see how-- [gunshots] [intense dramatic rattling] [intense dramatic rattling] [gunshot] [glass shatters] [dramatic music] [John voiceover] People have the habit of dying, and we're in the burying business. Well, that's simple. We didn't only bury 'em. We killed 'em. - Hmm. [Sheriff] What do you think you're doing? [laughs] - I see that you're a fellow official. I only just now drop in here for a little light refreshment, and I find four corpses. How shocking. - Sure did. - I was just beginning to gather together whatever valuables they might have for safekeeping in case some thief should come along. And I'd be unable to send along the valuables to the proper authorities. Sir, I am privileged to be the-- official undertaker for the entire territory. Having been appointed by the governor general himself. I must have a receipt - Okay. You can take 'em. - That raises a slight problem. You see, huh-- I am an older man in his sunset years, and you and your friend are obviously in the prime of your lives. And I'm sure you would be delighted to help me to take their bodies and place them in the funeral carriage. [somber music] [shouting] Hyah! Hyah! [insects chirping] - [John] 41-- [John murmuring] [John continues murmuring] - [Johnny] What'll we get for this? - Three shirts, one or two with bullet holes. $0.50 cents. Three pair of boots, one almost new. Say, $5.00. Guns? Hmm. $10. For the belts? $2, $2.50. Not bad, huh? Tomorrow, we can sell them to the first person we meet. Here, anything you want? - No. - You seem to have an eye for that shirt. - [yelling] I don't want it. - You don't have to bite my head off. What's the matter, Johnny? - Well, we're not going to get rich selling old clothes. - And don't start that all over again. - [Johnny] For once in your life, you're gonna listen to me. We need lots of money to be rich and lots of money is in banks. One bank robbery, one job. Just one-- and you're rolling in money. That's money, not receipts. That's money. Think about it. Now you think about it. We can be building our own funeral parlor. - Johnny, I want the best in the world for you. But not at that price. [dramatic music] [light music] [horse snorts] [John] District Commissioner. [wind blowing] [horses clomping] [insects chirping] I know, Johnny. We mustn't run any risk. Try to keep your mouth shut. - He talks an awful lot. - [John] I don't like him either. But he is the Commissioner, and we have to make our official rounds. It's our job. He has a corpse. It's our duty to pick it up. [light music] [exhales] [gasps] [wind blowing] Well, anything new around here? [chicken clucking] [Commissioner] For you, a corpse. [flies buzzing] Ain't no need to dress him up. Just to bury him. - Johnny? - Uh? - Corpse. [flies buzzing] - Didn't have anything on him? - Nothing. - What you got him for? - You got the dead fella and get him out of here. Beginning to stink up the place. - What you're waiting for the, huh-- - We're talking to the man. - Ah, ah. [chicken clucking] Drop it. [chicken clucking] [gun cocks] [intense dramatic rattling] - [John] Johnny. [spits] You forgot my receipt. [chuckles] [somber music] [wind whistling] [shouting] Hyah! Johnny, it's time I take you to Yucca. There's a part of your education I seem to have neglected. [Johnny] Was that? - Girls. [John shouting] Hyah! [melancholy music] [John] Come on, Johnny. Catch up. We should be there by dark. I remember-- near the station there's a great whorehouse. Well, you'll see it, Johnny. [raindrops pattering] Even as a bathtub. [raindrops pattering] Red carpets. [raindrops pattering] And brass beds. All the women we want. - You're right. [Johnny gasps] I do need a woman. [wind blowing] You sure we'll find her where we're going, huh? Are you sure? [John snoring] [man #1] Hey, Applebee, the Rebs raided Yucca. [man #2 ]They set fire to the town. [man #1] You find all the bodies you can handle, boy. [man #2] They'll keep you digging into sweat, Applebee. - [Johnny] Hey! Hey, what 'bout my girl? [flames crackling] [people yelling indistinctly] [distant explosions] [people yelling indistinctly] [distant explosions] [people yelling indistinctly] [horses whining] - [man] Give me the horse. [intense dramatic rattling] [blows thudding] [groans] [man yells] [distant explosions] [distant people yelling indistinctly] [intense dramatic rattling] [John] Johnny! Johnny! Stop it! [intense dramatic rattling] Let's get out of here, Johnny. Now! [dramatic music] Johnny, grab that belt. [Johnny shouting] Hyah! Hyah! [both shouting] Hyah! - Ho. Ho. Whoa. - Let's see. Let's see. It's gold, Johnny. It's gold. That is really gold. - That's gold. That's gold. [laughter] That's gold. [laughter] - Much more, there's lots more. [laughter] [sobbing] We did it. We did it. [sobbing] [John sobbing] Yeah. [Johnny] Are you sure it's gold? - [John] Even by the smell. [insects chirping] Sure. I'm sure. Tomorrow we'll take the road back there. We're gonna be sleeping in beds. And we won't even hear the howl of a coyote. We're gonna be real respectable people. As soon as we get to town, we'll hire some workers to clear the land. And we'll plant some grass-- nice soft grass. Green. And the funeral parlor. A mansion-- where people can visit their beloved dead. Like a holiday. - [John] And flowers. - Yes. - Like a park. [music playing] [bird chirping] [gentle music] [distant pulley screeches] [distant pulley screeches] [suspenseful music] [gentle music] [distant pulley screeches] [pulley screeches] - [Maria] Stop it, Jack. [groans] [indistinct arguing] [slow dramatic music] [gentle music] [pulley screeches] [pouring water] [gentle music continues] - Bath is ready. - You take. It I don't say I don't want you. - I only ask you to take a bath first. [bird chirping] In my country, they say "the more the men, "the more the smell." [bird chirping] You are quite a man, you know, Poggin. So tell me, what are you thinking now, hmm? [chicken clucking] [Maria] So sure you thought a new way to hurt me. Hmm? You can drown me in the well. But this will spoil the water. What's horrible thing. You don't want to waste the water because you love so much to take your weekly bath. - I'll be inside waiting like the men who waited for you in New Orleans. - Poggin? - And you had them just the way they were, didn't you? Dirty, smelly, drunk. Did you ask 'em to take a bath first. Huh? - I told you, I don't like 'em. How many times I must say to you. [bird chirping] It was just the job. To work in the salon, you must drink with the men. You must help them gamble. They said to me, "A woman makes a man feels better when he gambles." They spend more money like you. You liked it. When I was looking over your shoulder and bring your luck. And when you win, you say "here Maria just a tip." And when you lose, you say, "can I have it back?" I never gave money to no other men, Poggin. But I know you don't believe that. You think all the men are the same to me, don't you? Well, you are right. I just came here and start with you and robbed empty banks that have no money in them. Only because I wanted to become an outlaw with a price on my head. [gentle music] [pulley screeches] [gasps] If we go through this every time, you have to take a bath. - I told you I ain't taking no bath. - I know. I know. Your mind is made up. And when your mind is made up nothing can change it, right? - [Poggin] Right. Even when you have a plan so crazy, we can both get killed. - Look, if you're afraid, you can leave right now. [Poggin] We have no ties. I didn't ask you to come. Did I ? - [Maria] No. A year later. You're starting to nag just like every other woman I ever knew. You said "you wouldn't ask anything of me. "You just want to be with me." Now, because we have a couple of bad breaks. You don't like this idea? You don't like that idea. You're afraid if we do, will be caught. What you think life was gonna be with me? Paradise, huh? - No. I knew it was going to be an hard life, but now it's different. Now I never know what to expect. - This is just the way you like it, isn't it, hmm? You don't like to know what's going to happen from one minute to the next. Well, tomorrow hen we open that box and you see all that gold in there, then you're gonna be tellin' me how smart I am, aren't ya? [gentle music] [gentle music] - [Poggin] Now get up and get ready. I can't wait to put my hands in that wagon. It's more than half a million dollars in gold. You don't believe me, do you? - That's all right. Just the way you have done every damn thing we do together. You will not tell me the plan, but you know how to do it. I would see. Well, I don't see. Do you think the government is so crazy to send the gold in this place? - I've seen them come by here twice. - You were drunk. I never heard of such a wagon. - You'll see. You just do what I told you. - But they will not believe it. From nowhere I come out and wave my hand in the air. And say, "Hey, fellows, please stop your wagon. "My husband is hurt. "Leave your gold and help him." [Maria] They will believe it. They are so stupid. - I don't know. But other people get away with it. [Poggin] It's up to you to do it right? - How will they believe you are wounded? There is no one out here to shoot you. - Oh... [sighs] Tell them I was cleaning my gun-- and I shot myself. That's-- [yelling] All right, dammit! You tell me how you do it. - Oh. [sighs] This is not the matter. If you want me to cry and say "my husband is wounded." Okay, I will cry. - I don't think you could do it. You didn't cry when your own mother died. - How do you know it? You didn't stay around. - I don't like funerals. [Poggin] All right. [Maria sighs] You, uh, get on your horse. - What for? - [yelling] Do it. - What? - Get on your horse. - What do you want me to do? - Touch up. I'm thinking... All right. Move over there. - Where? [yelling] Over there! [Maria gasps] [suspenseful music] [horse snorting] - Jack, look. [dramatic music] Tell me what to do. [rifle cocks] Poggin, tell me what to do. They are coming. - [Poggin] Stay there and don't move. - Oh, you crazy-- - I said stay there. [dramatic music] [horses clomping] [metal thuds] - Watch it. [gun cocks] [horses snorting] [suspenseful music] [horses snorting] [gun cocks] - Oh. I just came from here. But I don't know how to go there. - In this desert. [gunshots] [body thuds] [gunshots] [body thuds] [gunshots] [horses whining] [gunshots] [Maria yells] Jack! [horses whining] [gunshots] [horses whining] [gunshots] [gunshots] [rifle cocks] [gunshots] [rifle cocks] [horses whining] [horses whining] [gunshots] [rifle cocks] [gunshots] [gunshots] [horses whining] [gun cocks] [gunshots] [horses whining] [gun cocks] [gunshots] [burning fuse] [explosion booming] [man yells] [horses clomping] - Johnny? Where are you going Johnny? - Where do you think I'm going? Meet a beautiful lady [laughs] Well, bring us some water on the way back, will you? [gentle music] [suspenseful music] [horse clomping] [dramatic music] - Hey fellas? You all right in there? - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't-- I didn't mean to hurt you. Hey, you open the door for me. I'll-- I'll take good care of you, huh? - Why? - [Poggin] Just open it. You can do it. Just open the door, and I saved your life. A little more, open the door. You can do it. [groaning] More. That's right. Reach, move. Move. [Poggin yells] Reach! [groans] Oh, don't die on me. Don't die on me, now. [groans] [groans] [gunshots] Damn it. [metal thuds] [murmuring] Oh, no... God. [gasps] [light music] - It's been a good day's ride, Johnny. Well, you'll see the place where we're going, Johnny. So green and beautiful. All you've seen is the desert. This gold will make our dream come true, boy. Beautiful cemetery. When the war is over, we'll cash our receipts. We'll build our funeral parlor. That'll be your inheritance, Johnny. You'll be a respectable man. The best catch for any woman anywhere. [gentle music] You know, I've got lots of ideas. We're not going to use stick crosses for markers. But real marble angels. We'll have the most-- the beautiful cemetery in the whole world. [melancholic music] [sobbing] [light music] [suspenseful music] [rifle cocks] - Get down of your horse. Move over there. [horse whinnies] - No one can ride that horse. - We'll see. - You don't need that gun. I'll take you where you wanna go. [horse snorts] [melancholic music] You feel all right. - I feel free. [thunder rumbling] - A house. No horses. - Do you think it could be empty? - Maybe. Lots of people died. [horse clomping] [thunder rumbling] ♪ [humming] ♪ ♪ [humming] ♪ ♪ [Lucius humming] ♪ - What are you saying? - Things, I hear. Things, I see. - So you are interest in what happen to people? - Yep. - I know a story-- a small story. You can even make a song of it. "But this was not enough for him. "He wanted the big job, "and finally he got it. "It was an iron wagon. "With more than half a million dollars in gold." Darling, I'm so scared. Let's make a deal. I will tell you where wagon is. And you just give me your horse. Do you accept? - I wouldn't go far with all that gold. We black people are all po'. No one else believes that a black man can own more than $5. We blacks are not even them. That's why I deserted. [wind blowing] [music playing] - [John] What's the matter? I don't know. I ran into something wow. [shouting] Hyah! - A mountain, Johnny. Beautiful mountain of gold. Oh, Johnny. Now we are truly rich. We have all the gold of Yucca. And now this. Why, there must be 100 of them. Maybe a thousand. A thousand receipts. - How are we ever get them into the carriage? - We'll have to make many, many trips. Many trips. How beautiful they are. We'll take them to our new cemetery. They should be very happy in our new cemetery. - [Johnny] We don't have any new cemetery. Who's going to cash in the receipts? Why, the the government, of course. Surely you don't doubt that. Now, help me load them on the carriage. - Can't you see these are only soldiers? Nobody. Nobody's gonna pay us to bury them. - If you won't help me put them on the carriage, I'll do it by myself. - Now, wait a minute. - Kindly stand aside, please. [slap thud] [somber music] [light music] [horse clomping] - When I come back, I'll bring you clothes. And a horse. [chickens clucking] [dramatic music] [melancholy music] - Listen, you're still sored with me. Oh, shit. Why don't you talk? - Not me. Maybe... one day. - Sorry I slapped you. - All right. I forgive you. [phew] - Glad that's over. [upbeat music] [rifle cocks] - Hey, don't you move, nigger boy. [suspenseful music] [gunshot] [rifle cocks] [drowning] [horses clomping] Hey, look here what I got. A nigger. - A bigger? Come on. - Who are you? - Lucious. - I didn't ask for your name about. About horse from the Cavalry. What army you selling to? - Po' folks. - What's all this for? - Where are you heading for? - A long way off. [chuckles] - You gonna come along with us. - I don't want no nigger in here with me. [horse whinnies] [spits] [shouting] Hyah! Hyah! [shouting] Hyah! Come on you boys. [shouting] Hyah! Move! Come on! [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [burning fuse] [explosion] [dramatic music] [prisoner] Get that nigger out of here. I'll kill him. - Shut up, boy. I will shut you up. You got a problem? Solve it yourself. [man] Maybe that nigger will solve it for him. [chuckles] [shouting] Hyah! - Here you are, boy. Here's some of these water [laughs] [yells] [thuds] [laughs] [groans] [laughs] [groans] [laughs] [shouting] Hyah! [prisoner yells] [rifle cocks] - Nigger boy, they're gonna hang you for this. You just nodded your own rope. [prisoner moans] [shouting] Hyah! Hyah! Come on! [shouting] Come one, boys! Move! Come on! [suspenseful music] - Ho. Ho. - [shouting] Ho! Ho there! - [John] Well, Commissioner, what are you doing so far from home? - I'm asking you the same question. - Give us that corpse you got there. [horse snorts] - Can't have him. - Why? 'Cause we need him to hang this nigger here. That's why. You don't need a corpse to hang a black man. - That's the law. Get moving. The law says it's gotta be buried. - That's right. [intense dramatic rattling] [gunshots] [gunshot] [horse whinnies] I missed one. - It's a pity we couldn't get the Commissioner to sign a receipt for his own dead body. [horse snorts] [suspenseful music] - Open your mouth. [shouting] Hyah! Hyah! [gentle music] [somber music] Here. Keep my share of the gold. Goodbye. God bless you. I got to find her.

I just forget you. - I wish it should have been that easy for me. You know, when you're alone, you get a lot of time to think. [inhales] What I did to you was wrong. I know that now. - You know it too late. - We can start a new life. The only trouble was we didn't have enough money. Well, now we're rich. We got all the gold we ever looking for. Half of it, it's yours. - Stay right there. You're still the same liar. You'll never change. - It's the truth, Maria. I swear it. It's right here.
