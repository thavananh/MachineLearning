Oh, we ain't goin' to Macon, ma'am. We just going down to Waynesboro, is all. Beggars can't be choosers. Thanks. Don't look like you should be traveling too far in your condition, ma'am. Well, what're you grinning at? Ain't you never seen nobody gonna have a baby before? Not hidin' in the swamp. Not usually. Well, I got me a big ol' gator out there treats me real nice 'cause I ain't afraid of nothin' that walks and I like 'em mean. I'm Arlie. How y'all doing? Got bullets in it? What do you think it's got? Bullets. All right. I gotta figure out some way to entice you boys to drive me down to Macon. Now, how am I gonna do that, I wonder? Told you, we ain't goin' to Macon. Don't get nervous. I ain't gonna shoot nobody or rape you or nothin'. (man nervously chuckles) 'Less I get irritated. Nobody here worried, we just ain't goin' to Macon. (exhales) I tell you what. You take me down to Macon fast and don't argue about it, I'll give you 50 bucks in gas. Somebody after you or something? Uh-uh. You boys know anything about how to get a baby born? (man) What'll it be? (driver) Fill 'er up. (toilet flushes) (heavy breathing) Oh, man. Come on, man, I don't wanna go to Macon. And how much you wanna bet she ain't got no 50 bucks? Yeah... Tell her it ain't gonna cost her diddly. I'll pay her back. (man) Well, hold on. (woman) Yeah, what do you want? Hi, Mama. Where you callin' from, prison? I ain't in prison. I'm coming home, Mama. What're you talking about? I just need a place to have my baby, is all. Did they parole you for that? No, I ain't got parole. I paroled myself. (phone hangs up) (cash register dings) ♪♪ I'll kill you you don't do what I say. What? What? You get in there and give me that cash. What? Come on, now, I ain't got all night. (man) Okay! Move it!

Sounds like "joy." And that's what you are, you're my joy. My sweet, sweet joy. She signed the papers. Arlie? Got a visitor. Mama! He's a boy, Mama. I knew he was gonna be. Look at him. This is as far as I'm comin'. Oh... Ow! ♪♪ (crying) (shifter clatters) ♪♪ (Arlene) I never thought I'd be scared. I pounded these walls so long, I thought I'd run outta here laughing and screaming, I'd be so happy, and... And now I'm scared to leave. Happens to everybody, Arlene. It's hard to believe I ain't gonna be here tomorrow. Ain't gonna have you to talk to. Your the only person ever listened to me. First time in my life anyone ever heard what I was saying. You listened to me while others slept. (both chuckling) It's not how many times you fall down that counts. It's how many times you get up again. I wrote that one down. Thank you, Ted. Got something for you. Hope it fits you okay. Didn't have no wrapping paper. It's beautiful. (chuckling) Try it on. Nobody can knit like you can. Well... Got a little something for you too. For me? (gasps) (reading) "In time of need, "look for comfort and strength here. Be in God's rest. Chaplain Ted." Thank you. So your, uh, your family know you're coming today? Yeah, but I ain't expecting a brass band or nothin'. Soon as I get me a job, sooner I get me Joey back. Already got me a place. Just need to find a job that pays good. Oh, and here's my new address, in case you wanna send me a Christmas card or something. Here's your knittin'. And your bus ticket to Macon and your traveling money, courtesy of the state. 25 bucks? Well, you get your work money when you report to your parole officer. Okay. Bye, Ethel. Good luck, Arlene. (chuckling) Old time's sake, Arlie? How many times I ask you to call me Arlene? Gave it up on account of how dumb a person looks chewing that. Yeah, well, you used to do a whole lot for a stick of gum, Arlene. Been watching you chew your gum and eat your dinner for eight years now. Got used to it, you know? Person'll get used to pretty near anything. (door slamming) (birds chirping) (car starting) (laughs) (bell dings) Thanks. Oh, no, bus is leaving. (bus pulling away) Was that bus to Macon? That was going north. Oh. Do you know when the next bus is to Macon? An hour and a half. Oh, man. Well, I'ma get me something to eat. Lots of things inside. Hot dogs, barbeque. No, I'ma get me something fresh. Something right off the vine. Hey, how you doing? (Arlie, writing) "Dear Joey, "I'm coming home to Macon and guess who I'm thinking about? "That's right. You. "I missed you so much, Joey. "Prayed every day that you was happy and doin' good. "I'm sending this to the county woman and hoping she's doing right and sending it along to you." ♪♪ Damn. Need some changes around here. Hello, this is Arlene Holsclaw calling. WP 273645. I got into my place okay and I'm just checking in like you told me to do. I'll see you Monday morning. Bye. (buzzing) Hey! 802 on the button. Good little radio, isn't it? Yes, ma'am. How about that rabbit? Dollar. How 'bout 50 cents? (chuckling) Okay. (mellow piano music playing) (knocking on door) Candy here? Nope, she don't live here no more. Damn, she got $10 I loaned her. I got these shoes on layaway... She really cleaned the place out, didn't she? Mm-hmm. Who are you? Oh, I'm Ruby from next door. We share that wall. Oh. You, uh, Candy's sister, Arlie? Arlene. She didn't leave you no sheets or nothing? Nope, took everything. (both chuckling) You just got out. I-I seen them dresses before. Yep, prison issued. But they're clean. (laughing) You sure there ain't no envelope laying around here with my name on it or nothin'? I ain't seen none. She didn't have much, you know. She didn't do nothin' here except sleep. Well, I was thinking she might come by. I ain't seen her since she was a scrawny little kid in seventh grade. Honey, she ain't coming back. He keeps all hi... I mean, his place is far away from here. But... But what? Well, she had a lot of friends, you know? And some of them might be stopping by. Men, you mean? Yeah. Aw, Candy... Well, I-I shouldn't have said nothing. But I didn't want you surprised if some John came by here with his tongue hangin' out and all. I wouldn't have been surprised. You need anything, you just knock. Okay, thank you. Nice meeting you. (knocking on door) (mother) Arlie? You in there? Open the door. Arlie, what's taking you so long? (dog barking, knocking continues) I'm coming, Mama! (mother) I brung you a bunch of stuff. I ain't gonna stand here holding it all day. I didn't know if you'd come. Ain't I always? How are you, Mama? About the same. I'm glad to see you. You look tired. Well, I ain't woke up yet. Wish I could sleep till 10:00. (sighs) Filthy dirty. Well, I brought you all kinds of stuff. It's just like Candy to go away and leave you nothing. Here, I brought you some pickle loaf and bologna. Oh, thanks, Mama. Did you know... Candy was hookin'? (scoffs) She'd been doing it since day one. Don't worry about it. You got three weeks free rent, don't you? (fridge shuts) You still making that pot roast like you used to, Mama? Them little potatoes with no skins? You always made the best pot roast. Everybody said so. Well, I do on special occasions. Me coming home, Mama? Ain't that special? I got no time to make fancy meals for you. Your daddy's sick. He wadn't a mean man, your daddy. I said, your daddy wasn't a mean man. Hey, they cut out your tongue or something? Can I fix you something, Mama? No, I ain't gonna be here that long. Why, I thought we co-- Well, I gotta work. Somebody in this family's gotta work, Arlie girl. Mama... I ain't Arlie no more. I'm Arlene now. That's what people call me. Bible says be humble. Meek. Patient. Bearing with one another in love. Chaplain taught me that. You done the best you could by my boy Joey, Mama. You took care of him for three years. Driving cab, and cooking and cleaning, and taking care of Daddy, too. I didn't have... No cause for gettin' mad like I did, but-- Givin' up a kid ain't the end of the world. Now, June and Candy put out two kids that way. It wasn't your fault I lost him, it was mine. I was the one in prison. I was the one who'd done what I done. I did it, and that's that. You didn't never get attached to him, anyway. Anyways, I ain't mad no more. I just wanna know why... (faucet running) (faucet stops running) ... you didn't tell me you was gonna give him up. I done what was best for him. Now, it wasn't gonna do anybody any good for you to raise a fuss. It would've done me some good. Me writin' all them letters, and him not even there. Well, I wrote you, didn't I? A year after you give him up. Yeah, and what did you do, huh? Go and try and burn yourself up, didn't you? Try and beat the devil to it. Now you got nothin' to worry about. No kids, no worry. Where is he, Mama? Now your sister June is out to here. Doesn't know when to stop, that girl. 'Course, I ain't one to talk. Mama-- I bought you these dish towels. Bet they didn't have no colored dish towels where you been-- Mama, I asked you a question. Where is he? I don't know where he is! I saw him about a year ago. You seen him? Well, what'd he look like? Just a skinny little thing. I don't know, I didn't stop. I was takin' my cab back and he was waitin' for a bus. What bus? I don't know. It was over to, um, Rollingwood somewheres. Will you just forget it?! It's over and done with. Is that yours? Yeah. Chaplain give it to me. My bible too. Is he the one that give you your new name? It ain't a new name, Mama. You give it to me. You just never used it. After the fire, he's the one took care of me. Done a lot for me, Mama. Yeah... Bet you done a lot for him too. What did you say? You know what I'm talkin' about. He's a man, ain't he? I knitted him a sweater. That is all I done. Yeah, sure, I bet you kept him real warm, didn't you? Aw, just forget it. (dog barking) Oops. It slipped. You ain't changed a bit, Arlie. I told you not to call me Arlie no more. My name is Arlene now. Arlene. Arlene! Arlie, Arlene. The name don't matter. I been a lot of things, but I ain't dumb. No, you was never dumb. You remember who I am, don't you? I'm the one who took you back after all you've done. I'm the one who got you this place! I'm the one that took care of your kid when no one else would. You took him and gave him away, Mama. Yeah, all right, well... Well... I come, I done what I can. Not that anybody's gonna thank me for it. You was just born bad. Same hateful brat, right? Yeah, that's right. The same hateful brat. Mama. I'm sorry. Can I come-- Can I come to Sunday dinner sometime? Sunday's my day to clean. Mama, what kind of meat makes a pot roast? A roast makes a pot roast. Shoulder. Chuck. Or rump. Don't touch me. ♪♪ Don't touch Mama. Don't touch Mama. 'Cause you just wanna slit Mama's throat. (screaming) She gave away my baby! Guard! (guard) Shut up, Holsclaw. Need to make a phone call! Come here. Come here, baby. Just one phone call, please? Bitch gave away my baby. Huh? You want anything? I want you to shut up. Yeah, burn. Burn! Bastards! Mama gave away my baby! My Mama! (screaming) (guard) We got a fire! Guard! Guard, I'm on fire! (screaming) (prisoners shouting) (car starting) (birds chirping) (Arlene) "Yea, though I walk through the valley "of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, "for thou art with me. "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. "Thou preparest a table before me "in the presence of mine enemies. "And annointest my head with oil, "my cup runneth over, "surely goodness and mercy shall follow me "all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." ♪♪ (door opening) (door closing) How about painting mine when you're done? Hey, Ruby, how you doing? All right. I got that money Candy borrowed. Now, that's your money, not Candy's. You hold onto it. It is your money. You take it. Girl. (laughing) You want some pickle loaf? You got anything cold to drink? I got sweet tea. 'Course, the fridge don't work too good. Getting the place ready for my boy Joey. I used to lay in my bunk, staring at the ceiling, dreaming about having a little place. What color I was gonna paint the ceiling. I dreamed it, and now here I am doing it! Oh, that's him. That's my boy. Aww! He's a nice looking boy. Really? Mm-hmm. Where's he at now? Some other folks is taking care of him. Temporarily, over in Rollingwood. Soon as I get my place fixed up, I get me a job, I'm going over to county people, I'm getting him back, mm-hmm. And I'ma put his bed right here. And I'ma put up some kind of divider so he's got his privacy, 'cause privacy is important to a person. He ain't no baby no more. He's 8 years old. Look at him. ♪♪ (knocking on door) Hey, Ruby. What did you do? Do you like it? Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, it's cool, it's... It's real dramatic looking. Come on in here. Well, you know, people do crazy things when they first get out. Ooh-ee. I remember my first day out of Fayetteville. You was in Fatalville? Yeah. You never told me. Well, I been out three years now. I'm still checking in with the parole. Anyways, my first day out, I heaved a whole gallon of milk out of the window. Did it hit anybody? Just bounced, is all. Damn. (laughing) I gotta get respectable, Ruby. I gotta find me a good job, pays good, and regular so I can get my boy back. You know anything around? What kinda work you do before? You mean legal? Mm-hmm. I learned reading and writing at Correctional. Even got my high school diploma and everything. I can do my adding and subtracting and make change. And I could knit sweaters real good. I even sold some at Correctional. Anything practical? I worked making sandwiches in the cafeteria. And everybody said C-block wasn't ever cleaner as when I was doing janitorial. Well, there's a dishwasher quitting this week. You want me to talk to the boss about it? Dishwashing? That don't pay, does it? Well, not a whole lot. I don't know. You got to find yourself something right off. That's the trick. That way, you've laid your foundation. What kinda place you work at? At the Silver Skillet over on 4th Avenue. I'm the cook. Well, hell. I'd love to cook. You got to start at the bottom and work your way up. That's how I got where I am. (woman) You are not to leave a 50 mile radius. You are not to associate with other ex-offenders. (Arlene) Yes, ma'am. Your apartment and your person are subject to search at any time. Yes, ma'am. In case you forget, here are the conditions of your parole in black and white. You violate any of these rules, you go right back into custody, no second chance. Do you understand? Yes, ma'am. I see you've done a lot of knitting. That's nice, but not easy to actually get paid for that. A neighbor friend of mine gave me a lead on a dishwashing job. Oh, good. Let me know if that doesn't work out. We have an arrangement with some employers in town. I can put you on the waiting list. Pays minimum wage. Thank you, ma'am. Okay, this is the fun part. Sign here for your work money. Where? Right here. This booklet shows you how to budget your shopping, cook nutritious meals, balance your checkbook, conduct a successful job search, that sort of thing. A lot of the girls find it very helpful. I'm sure they do, ma'am. $782.23. You heard the saying easy come, easy go? Oh, this wasn't easy come, ma'am. I worked eight, long years for this money. (smooth jazz playing over speakers) (woman chuckles) (children chattering) Arlene, is that you under there? Oh, Ruby, could you help me with this thing? Okay, okay. I got it. That's it. Okay. Whoa. (both chuckling) Oh, man. Ooh! Oh, my God. Phew! Ten bucks at a Salvation Army and now I don't have to sleep on Candy's mattress no more. Eww! You know what? I got me my own checking account. I'ma have special ones made with my name on it and a beautiful sunset and everything. And I got one of them cards, you just stick it in and money comes out. Sometimes. (both laughing) So l-- Let's get rid of this thing. Oh, great. (grunts) Oh, Lord, I just remembered. My parole agent told me I ain't supposed to associate with no ex-felons. Cool with me. (laughing) Come on, Ruby. Since when do we ever listen? Mm-hmm. Hey, I set up that job interview about that dishwashing job. Oh, thanks! (knocking on door) (man) Open up, Candy! Candy don't live here no more, she moved! Goodbye and good night. (man) Arlie girl, is that you in there? Open up. Let me in, girl. (pounding on door) Who is that? Who do you think it is? Come on, let me in. (pounding continues) Just a minute, I ain't decent. I know, girl, that's what I like about you. Come on, I seen it all before. (knocking) Quiet! Oh, come on! I'm coming! (man laughing, knocking) Hi, baby. Hey, Carl. What're you, mad at me, Arlie girl? People call me Arlene now. How'd you find out where I was? Damn, your hair's different. It's kinda, I don't know, something. It's hard to tell what's going on with the rest of you... Arlie. Arlene. (laughing) Would you watch where you lean? I just got done scrubbing that trim. Don't be flickin' no ashes on the floor neither. They been messing with your head, ain't they? Who's the kid? That's my sister June's boy Joey. I like to knit. See, Johns, they don't, uh, they don't like looking at pictures of family and bibles. Jesus. Kind of makes them uncomfortable, you know? They just might lose their, uh, enthusiasm. There ain't gonna be no Johns. And I ain't supposed to be hangin' around with no ex-cons. So you just better go, Carl. Leave me alone. This your new boyfriend? Chaplain give me that. Ooh. Jesus love you, Arlene? Yeah. He does. Not the way I can. Oh... I-I'm getting me a respectable job. Doing what? Something that pays good. Arlie, you know three things. Hookin', runnin', and shootin'. Now, two of 'em pays good, neither one of 'em respectable. I got me a real job right now if I want it. All's I gotta do is say so. Doing what? Huh? Dishwashing. Dishwashing? My! What kinda big bucks you gonna make dishwashing, huh? I don't know, they ain't told me yet. I gotta find out when I go for my interview. You'll make 150 a week. 150, standing over a sink of greasy, gray water, pluckin' out blobs of bread and lettuce. People puttin' pieces of chewed up meat in the napkins, and you gonna pick it out eight hours a day, six days a week, 150 lousy pictures of Big Daddy George. Now, how long it gonna take you to make 150 workin' for me, huh? A night. Less than a night. Two... hours-- You ain't stayin'. (buttons popping) You keep your clothes on, Carl. Two hours, baby. Two hours. You sleep all morning, you spend the rest of the day shoppin', tryin' on... perfume. You stay here, you work eight hours a day, your hands get all wrinkled, your feet swell up like... blood sausage. I'm tellin' you, Carl, to go. I'm tellin' you git. I don't wanna go back to prison. (laughing) Prison? I ain't talkin' about prison. It ain't prison I'm thinkin' about, honey. That gun, Carl. It-- It went off. I know, Arlie. I know. See, that's what guns do. They just, uh... go off. Bam... Bam... Ow! There she is! There she is. Hello, Arlie girl. "I'm Arlene." Who the hell you kidding, kiddo? You out now. Arlie, you don't have to fool nobody. I said for you to go. You need clothes. I don't want nothin' of yours. You're gonna come lookin' for me. You know that, don't you? Arlene. You tell the bartender who you are. Who you really are. (whimpering) And you just wait till I get there, okay? (hums) ♪♪ (vehicle starting) (moaning) You've got his eyes. My sweet baby. My sweet baby. (vehicle starting) (jukebox playing honky tonk) She's in the kitchen. (diners chattering) Hey, Ruby, how's it going? Hi, Arlene. Mr. Collins should be here in a little while. Um, Ruby, I was wondering, how much that dishwashing job pay? I don't know, 150 maybe. 150 for standing around all day scraping chewed-up food off people's plates? Yeah, that's right. Go on, take a look around. (plates clattering) Without any office skills and, um, given your recent experience in... Prison. Yes. I think your best bet for a job is with your parole agent. Oh. Thanks for coming by, sorry we can't help. No, okay, thank you. (coin rattles) (sighs) (mutters) "Earn $50,000 a year. Chance of a lifetime, call now." (man) No, that's great, Mary June. Mm-hmm. (chuckles) Well, 5,000 in one month is your best yet, right? Mm-hmm. Right. (chuckling) Okay. And I'm proud of you. I'll send the check over today, okay? Good. No, it's no problem. Bye. Hi, I'm Brian Craig. My name is Arlene Holsclaw-- And you'd like to change your life, right, Arlene? Can you feel the healing properties of Regal? Mm-hmm. Do you know what's more important to our company than these special products? Mmn-mm. You are. I am? Mm-hmm. Now, open your eyes, Arlene. I want you to see something. Oh. What did you do? Regal did it. Regal uncovered your beauty. Now it's going to uncover your intelligence. Where you been, Arlene? Mr. Collins, the boss, waited 'round here half an hour for you. I went and got me a respectable job that pays good. What you talkin' 'bout, Arlene? How would you like to make money while you're sleepin'? And have soft hands too? Bible says ask and it will be given. Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be opened for you, and that's what I done. I asked the Good Lord for a job that pays good so I can get my Joey back. And now, you are looking at a future distributor of Regal beauty products. Hand lotion, shampoo, you feel the good that's doing you? The big money ain't in your door-to-door. See, I go out and sign people up just like Brian done to me. And they give me the $500 and I get 20% of everything they sell. I'm sleepin', I'm takin' a bath, I got people workin' for me, makin' me rich. You can see why I couldn't take that dishwashing job. Did this Brian pop you for 500? Uh-huh, and now I got me my own busi-- It's a con, girl. Ruby... I been in his fancy office. I seen his big car, and his parking place with his name on it. And his own commission check, $20,000. You go back down to his fancy office, he won't be there, I guarantee it. Why do you say that? Trust me, girl, I been there. Now, I know a con when I smell one. Oh, man. Oh, man... Oh, man... Um... Oh, Ruby. That is all the money I had in the world. What am I gonna do? Well, you gotta do something. Can't nobody do it for you, and that dishwashing job is long gone. (sighing) (dog barking) (grunting) Oh, man. Can I-- (crutches clacking) ♪♪ (phone dialing) (phone ringing) ♪♪ (indistinct chattering) ♪♪ (shop bell rings) Hi, I'd like to talk to a supervisor, please. I'm the owner. Oh, pleased to meet you. My name is Arlene Holsclaw. I'd like to show you my knitting. Well, we're, um, busy right now. Could you come back tomo-- Won't take but a minute. Oh... my... Where did you learn these stitches? (laughs) I taught myself, ma'am. Is this an original pattern? Everything's original, ma'am. That's the fun part. You shoulda seen their eyes bug out. I been feelin' good ever since. Anyway, she looked at every one twice and then asked me about my Fair Isle, about my Aran, about my intarsia. And then she said she'd love some and she wants to put my sweaters in her windows so people passing by can see 'em, and-- (knocking at door) (man) Candy? I miss my Candy! Candy don't live here no more. She moved, goodbye and good night. (man) Candy, it's me. Double 0-7. (clears throat) I always paid Candy 50. You here for the knitting class? Knitting class? Ruby, we got a man who wants to be in the knitting and Bible study class. Praise the Lord! Tell him to come on in here! He bring his Bible and his knitting needles with him? Did you? You see Candy, you tell her I stopped by to say hello, hear? You have a nice evening. You too. (both laughing) Go on, go on, finish telling me. So she says she wants me to teach a class to women who wanna learn how to knit. And when I ain't teaching, I'm working in her store and I'm earning $6.30 an hour. Now, that ain't bad. Ow! Pot roast. I made potatoes with no skins. My, my, my. Now, all this just for me and you? Well, I-I gotta practice cookin' so I can cook decent when my boy gets home. (sighs) I might get him a bicycle too. I always wanted to have a bicycle. Except for my mama... Anyway, I'm gonna go to county people tomorrow. Let me try. Okay. (gasping) Jesus, bread of life, thank you for your everlasting love. Amen. Amen. Hi, there. (laughing) Arlene Holsclaw? Yes, ma'am. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Well, what can we do for you? I've come to see about getting Joey back. Um, Miss Holsclaw, we do have your file but... I got a good job now and a place to live, and I'm fixing it up real nice. I can make a good home for him now. Didn't your mother write to you about-- I know she put him out to foster care, but I'm back now. Miss Holsclaw, your mother didn't put Joey in foster care. Yes, she did. She put him up for adoption. How could she do that? She had that right. She adopted Joey from you. Didn't you agree to that? No. No, I-I... I-I-I signed some papers, but I thought that was just to keep him in the family. I-I thought that was just temporary. There's nothing temporary about adoption. And once your mother became Joey's legal mother, she could make the same decision about adoption that you did. Without asking me? Yes. Why didn't nobody tell me? Once legal rights are terminated, we cease all contact with the terminated parent. My boy and I, we ain't seen each other in a long time. Now, I know it's gonna take time to work this out. But I been waiting eight years. I can't wait no more. I wanna see my Joey this weekend. I wanna start gettin' on a regular schedule with him. I'm sorry. You are legally prohibited from all contact with the child. When the child comes of age-- You're telling me that I can't even see Joey? No. He is my son. How do I know they're treating him right? He's fortunate to have been adopted by a very fine couple who love him very much. Oh. I placed him, so I know. Oh, well, I'd like to see that for myself, if you don't mind. If you attempt contact with the child, you will be subject to revocation of parole. He's no longer your child. ♪♪ Hi, y'all know my name. Arlene. I'm happy y'all are here. I hope I can teach you something. Um, we'll be learning three basic stitches. Stockinet, rib, and the gartering. But, uh... my feeling is is stitches ain't the most important thing. I can teach you basic stockinet in five minutes. I... I started knitting in a hospital, when I... when I got this burn.
