foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Sir... Sir... My wife... she is missing. She was with me in the car. I can't find her now! What is your name, Sir? Please tell me. Luke... Luke Antony. Okay. What really happened? While we were headed to the mountains... I took a wrong turn. Not sure how it happened, but we got into an accident. My head struck something and... I... I was unconscious for some time. When I woke up Sophie... wasn't there in the car. I looked around. Couldn't find her. Sophie... Sophia Luke. That's her name. Sir... Isn't that area known for leopard sightings? She was pregnant. Look in between the rocks. And in the water. Sir, do we look in the woods? Yes, go ahead. Sophie... Sophie! Ashraf, take a look at this. - What is it... - A slipper! - Where? - Right there. She should be somewhere here. Let's go a little further in and search. Sir, what did you say? - Come here... we found a slipper. - Okay, coming. Sometimes only god knows the ways in which fortune might befall one. Hey... she might be somewhere nearby. Hey Balu... come over here. You look in that direction. Keep looking... quick! Everyone! Keep going ahead. That day, the police and the village folk searched that whole forest. She wasn't found. The next day, the number of villagers reduced. Two more days in, nobody showed up for the search. The police got tired too. The only question that remained was whether a tiger got her or a leopard. Everyone was sure she wouldn't be found. But no matter who said what, he would have none of it. He believed nobody. He was sure he would find her. And that he would not leave until he found her. "In my arms, she was!" "One for the loss, aiming the reasons." "I need it once." "I might not find what I lost." "I pursue no pleasure." "Nothing was a choice." "No thing was a choice." "It's all a picture now." "And it's clearer everyday." "I still seek." "I still see." Sir, can I be a little honest here? Since it's been more than a couple of months now, I don't think we will find her. You need to move out of that riverine area. We'll arrange a good lodge for you. And you can sleep better without the mosquitoes. It's almost as if you are mocking us. People have already started saying things... like the police isn't efficient. So please don't trouble us too much. "In my arms, she was." "One for the loss, aiming the reasons." "I need it once." "I might not find what I lost." "I pursue no pleasure." "Nothing was a choice." "No thing was a choice." "It's all a picture now." "And it's clearer everyday." "I still seek." "I still see." Sir, you don't smoke or drink? Not anymore. So... you used to! It's a good time to start again. Have a couple of pegs and you'll be able to sleep peacefully. I know Balan... and that's why I am not drinking. What if I get high and doze off forgetting everything like you said? How will I know if someone shows up at that time? That will really sadden her. I made that mistake once. That shouldn't happen again. Uh, Sir... don't be disheartened. She will come back. We often hear such news. 'A person missing for 5 years returns.' 'A missing person was found 10 years later in a different place.' This will be like that. She will return. Uh oh! Sir... Why have you detained him? - I was drinking. He was not! - Hey... sit down! Drinking and living out of a tent... you do that in your own land. That's a public place. Not anybody's property! If we find you there again... Ashraf... make them sit right there. Let them go only in the morning. Sometimes only god knows the ways in which fortune might befall one. One just needs to be at the right place at the right time. Sir... come. Get the car around. I am his son-in-law, Sir. Shashankan. Won't introduce us though. He's ashamed of me. - Hello! - Look ahead while you drive! Where are we going? I've been looking ahead for a while. That cop has a point, Sir. If it is your own property, nobody can throw you out. Stuff like last evening won't happen. This is my son's house. My elder son Dileep's house... Before the work could be completed, he passed away in an accident. And I couldn't do much afterward. A lot of people eyed this property. But I refused to sell it. You take it. Pay me whatever you feel is right. You spent a night in jail because of me. Made me really upset. You're selling it?! You decided that by yourself? And who must decide? It's my property. It's in my name. - Don't you want to ask your children? - I don't have to ask any prick! I've given them all their share. You mind your own business. Let's step inside and look. Anil my dear, shall I serve breakfast? Yes, Ma. Be there in a minute. This is the last goodbye. I will never be back here. Mark my words. You seem like an innocent man. People will con you. Ever since Dileep, began work on that house, it's only been trouble. He got roadblocks at every turn no matter what he did. Eventually, he met with an accident when he was returning from the house. Really! The locals all know this. Since the day brother-in-law died, this man has been trying to sell it. Would anyone in the right sense of mind buy it? I am not sure if you'll believe me... The house was my brother-in-law's long cherished dream. You think he would leave it as soon as he dies? People have seen him around. Even I have heard some sounds at night. Uh... Sir... I am not lying! It is true! What is he doing here? Sir... all the documents are here. Ah. This is for you, Balan. - Okay. - Open it, Shashankan. Not counting it, Balan? Not needed. I trust you. Sir, I am off. See you later! Will you though?! Why will we?! Balan is leaving for good. Goodbye! Who do I have here anyway? Those who were mine died. Ever since my elder son returned from Dubai, no one cared for me. Nobody wanted me. Neither the wife nor the kids. I was reduced to a crumb! It isn't fair to keep a tab on these things. Though I can't help but say. Whatever I made during my best years, my wife and kids made hay with. But this... she won't get her hands on. This is my retirement fund. The fund to retire from that family. I don't need those who don't need me. Not saying I am off on a pilgrimage. I am going to have a good, dignified life. To be frank, I am upset that I cheated Mr. Luke. Mr. Luke is a nice man. He'll forgive me. If I knew he was going to collect money, I would have sent him along. How much money was it? I don't know exactly. He never tells us these things. 45... is what Shashankan told us. Lakhs. Oh... That's quite a lot. Hmm. But you know Balan... he will wander for a while and return. Dad took off with it, Sir. Really? Why do you think so? There was another woman... He was... having an affair with her. Even my mother knows that. That money belonged to my children. Sir! Why don't you understand? He didn't keep anything here. Sir... I found Balan's body. But the money is gone. It's not here. Listen Kid, you are putting everyone in trouble. They are asking for their wages after all. Everyone has their own needs. It's been a few months since they have been paid. Babu, a load is ready to be delivered. Two weeks at the most. I will pay whatever I can. The rest-- How much will a single load cover anyway?! Listen, if you can't handle it well, don't do it. Don't trouble others like this. When Dileep was around, this organisation was run so well. I'd like to talk to you alone, Babu. Murali, give us a moment. Listen child... I understand what you are going through. But I cannot stop people from getting angry anymore. We were being patient because of our regard for Dileep. You know that too. So... somehow try to raise some funds. "Open that window" "and see what follows the wind." "Up on that hill I see nothing..." "that is... still." "My stories are not over." "My stories are not over... don't go!" They go to a funeral like this in the West. I have seen it in an English movie. "My stories are not over." "My stories are not over... don't go!" "It's part of the truth." "I see the power lies in all of the tools!" "You see the moves I make, I got all the moves!" "You feel my pain, I wish how bad, was it true!?" Anymore of his relatives to arrive? Why is he here? Don't go to the village square. People will pass unnecessary comments. His brother gifted him the bike. They were really close. Dileep would lay down his life for his brother. Anil is all I have now. Drat! I should have been careful. Should never have allowed him to go alone with so much cash. This was bound to happen, Sir. You need to be destined to enjoy these things. Didn't everyone here have great regard for him? Well... he never did anything for this family. Every day there was a fight. To be honest, I am a bit relieved. I have suffered way too much. How did the kids feel about him? Both the boys hated him. I should have been more careful. Hey! Why didn't you answer when Sujatha called? She said there's some work in the factory. It's unpaid work! She won't pay, Ma. That poor thing! Why don't you just do it for her? She got married, aren't you done with her yet? - But she is single now, right? - Come on! I can only nudge you. Anyway, she's a good girl. I'm cool with someone who was once married. But I'm not. Hmm! I know where you go everyday, dressed up like that. Great! File a complaint at the council! Did you hear that sound? Like what, Sir? Sir! I didn't hear anything. You might have imagined it. Sir... I'll leave then. It's getting late. My wallet is on the table. Should I come tomorrow? Oh! You might have the workers here tomorrow, right? When rest of the work gets done, this will be a fantastic house! I barely visit this place. Dileep used to hate me. Oh, its really late now, got to go! Ammu! Can you stay back till tomorrow? I can. There's no one back home anyway. Shall I cook something to eat? Why do you care for a guy searching for his 'missing wife'? I didn't care at first. But then I thought, he's a man after all. He will pay me well. But wait! What's your problem? What were you doing there anyway? He didn't sleep all night, saying he heard some sound. How can anyone be so scared? Sound? I was quiet the whole time. I told you right?! - He has done some fraud. - Oh there you go again! Then why is he so scared? Is he hiding here after murdering someone? Feels that way, right? Now even you felt that doubt right? I felt this when I first saw him. He came here and narrated a movie like story. And everyone believed it! He is an absolute crook! I feel like he is a decent man. Then what about his wife? Would that be a lie too? Has anyone even seen his wife in this village? Forget that. Doesn't she have any family? Is he the only one she has? When an outsider buys a house here in the back of beyond people are bound to gossip! Won't he be blamed for everything that happens here? So the story helps, right? Top that with sentiments around missing one's wife. But why? What would he gain from it? Why would he take all this trouble just to create a scene here? Only he can answer that. But I'm sure of one thing. He is here for a reason. But all his documents are foolproof. UK citizen. Businesses and such in Dubai. But he can't afford a flight! So he travelled here all the way in his car. That too via Nepal! He is just fooling us, Sir! No, a lot of people do that these days. Your folks aren't home? No, Sir. My wife and child are staying at her house. Since they are in mourning, I thought let them stay back there for a while. That was such a strange incident. We saw him leave with the cash! Yes. I didn't think you were so violent. What, Sir? - I mean, the people of this town... - Uh, huh? How could you all beat someone to death so easily?! It need not be our people, Sir. Could have been outsiders too. Do you suspect anyone? No, Sir. Do you...? Well, if you ask me... Do you suspect anyone, Sir? I'm just upset that the money I gave didn't benefit Balan or his family But that wasn't your fault, right? It was just their bad time. But that's not done. We got to do what we got to do. The police are useless. We have to find his killer. I will take back that money, and give it to you, Shashankan. As the eldest son-in-law, it now belongs to you. I don't want their money, Sir! - You don't? - No. - No. - So we need not think about it? Then, so be it. Sir, you didn't say why you came to meet me. - Didn't I? - No. Of course I did! Help! Someone please help! The barn is on fire! Sister! Sister! Please come here, quick! "I won't live this lie." Fetch some more water! "A wasted love..." Sister! "A wasted perfect life..." "Fading before my eyes!" Somebody help us! "Stone-cold heart." "A wasted love." "Fading before my eyes!" "Before my eyes!" Hey! I think your brother-in-law had some secret treasure hidden in the barn. He has been sitting like this since last night. Was it in there? Yes. What! We are stepping out for some tea. It's him! He did it! Who? You were the last one to see Balan, right? That feels like a trap question. If I say I'm the last person who saw him, would I be made the killer too? Did you meet Balan that day? That sounds better. Yes. I had met him. Where? - Don't you want to count it, Balan? - Nope. I trust you. Bye, Sir! See you later! Would you?! Isn't that Balan's son-in-law? Yes, Sir! Shashankan. I didn't know that such a transaction would happen there, Sir. But I did see him walk away with the cash. You must have work to do, right? Then you may leave. Yeah. I left right away, Sir. It was rush hour and I'd get a lot of trips. Anil! Where are you? Dad! Dad! Dad, wait! Wait, Dad! Dad! Where are you going with that? Why do you care? Get off me! Dad, give it to Mom! I've given her a lot! You know that! This is my son's money! - He's not just your son! - Get lost! - Hand it over, Dad! - Get your hands off the bag! Dad! Just give it! Dad, please don't... Come on! Go away! Hey! - Leave me alone! - Hey! Don't do anything stupid! Hey! That's your father! Brother-in-law! I made a mistake. My Mom has got no one else to take care of her. Brother-in-law! You keep this. I had so many plans with that money! He took it, right? How stupid are you?! First I gave Balan money to buy the house. Then I killed him and took the money back. Interesting. Sounds like a fun story. If we think about it it does seem probable. Right, Sir? Brother! It's our money! We have got to take it back! Don't want him to feel like he screwed us over! I can't. My limbs are trembling already! If the money goes missing, would he tell everyone about us? He won't. Let's go. He is a bigger fraudster than us. He doesn't know that I'm involved with Dad's case. That plays to our advantage. You go first. I'll join you at the right time. Luke! Wait here. I'll go and check. Luke! Luke! Where did he go at this hour? Oh... usually he is glued to his darned phone all day. The things these wicked kids do! Hello? It was a tipper truck. I saw it with my eyes. Karnataka state registration plate. The doctor said he was very lucky! It was God's grace, Sir. Hmm... I know. Now he's all you have. Something was bothering him for days. He would not take a shower and rarely ate on time. We're going through a bad time, Sir. Hello! You have to pay these bills. - See that woman sitting there? - Yeah. Give it to her. - She is my daughter-in-law. - Ah, okay. That's Dileep's wife. She runs his factory. She earns quite a bit from it. Let her pay. I don't remember seeing her at your place. I don't let her get too close to us. She lives with her family. Excuse me, she told me to give you the bill. - I never really liked her ever. - You can pay at that counter. He toiled in Dubai, built that bungalow. It was all for her. Card please. Please try to pay up the rest soon. It gets quite complicated here otherwise. Coffee? Yes. We haven't met before. I'm Luke Antony. I purchased Dileep's house. I know. Then you wouldn't mind a coffee? Please? Can't predict anything about these types of kids. - Huh? - I mean about Anil... I was shocked initially. Sujatha... you run a factory, right? What's your product? Cashews. Nice. Not a coffee person? You didn't have it. It's bad, right? Since the coffee plan failed, shall we think of something else? Let's have breakfast together. It'll be dawn soon. Just the two of us... at my house. Okay! Never mind. See you! Long live workers' unity! Long live workers' unity! Long live trade union committee! Long live indefinite hunger strike! Things have gone out of my hands. To be fair, they can't be blamed. The factory got shut down, Sir. They started a strike there. It was an occasional source of income. That's gone too. I don't even have money to pay the hospital bill. The medicines being prescribed are expensive. I already sold all my jewellery. I don't even have anyone from whom I can borrow. But you have to pay the bills! Else, they'll stop the treatment! I lost my elder son in a similar accident. I am still dealing with that pain. I'm asking for help only because... I'd like to see at least Anil back on his feet. Please buy that factory from me and pay me out. Please don't say that! You are Dileep's mother after all. I didn't come here to settle down. When I am done here, I will leave. You know that. It's stressful to manage other things amidst all that. I'm not asking for money to splurge. It pains me to sell it too. That factory was Dileep's dream. If I sell it... I know it will hurt him. Oh, really? Then we'll think about it. She has to agree to it first. Dileep had registered it under both our names. I tried convincing her. She would rather see it fall apart than sell it to someone. Please try to talk her into it. What are your intentions, Sir? Only good intentions. Charity... just charity! It's a hospital case. Can we ever say no to it? I can. You may leave. Alright. No problem! She cried and pleaded with me to come here. If you aren't interested, I'll leave. I have no interest in selling this, sorry! You don't have to sell it. I will buy her share. You just have to agree. We can be partners. So how do things operate here? Need to be sure before I make an investment. Come. "Open that window and see what follows the wind!" "Up on that hill I see nothing..." "that is still!" 'Anyone who finds the woman in this photo named Sophia Luke' 'dead or alive, should report to the nearest police station' 'or contact the phone number below.' 'They will be suitably rewarded.' 'Contact Luke.' This man is trouble! What's wrong with you? I just did him a favour! He got busy buying that factory and house and forgot about his wife. Poor thing! I had to remind him! Got any copra cakes here? You could have just called me, Sir. So tell me something about your family, Ammu. Why spoil the mood, Sir?! I'm all alone, Sir. I have no one. Just like you, Sir. Anything I explain beyond that would bore you. Who told you that I'm all alone? I know. You are all alone. Sir, I'm the one who gave that photo. Satheesan stuck those posters. He is a bit off the nut. Sceptical of everyone. He thinks that you are plotting something big here. Also he is unable to figure out why you are after Sujatha. Maybe it's stressing him out. Sir, you first bought Dileep's house. And then his company. Now only she remains. Tell me the truth, Sir. Did you know Dileep? Why did you have to ask that, Ammu?! Offer flowers and prayers. It's been two years already, Sir. He left us early at such a young age. True. Too early. I could never have enough of him calling me 'Ma'. The dead ones have left us. What good will come out of our lament? I would advise you the same thing. It was her fate. You took good care of her when she was alive. Find peace in that. Yes. You should move on, Luke. We often don't realise the value of some things in life... until we lose them... or till we realise that we would never get them back. Pray for your brother Dileep's soul, who passed away during the Aries sun sign... Sometimes I feel like he is still with us. Everything he desired and set out to do do remained incomplete. The house, the factory, and his marriage. No, no! Don't listen to her. He is no more. They say, those who die with unfulfilled desires, don't leave this world soon. If that's true your wife might be still around you. You know I'm not real? I am your imagination. I exist only in your head. How many times should I say this? If she is with me, shouldn't Dileep be somewhere around here too? He is here, Sir. All his loved ones are here, right. Correct. Where else would he go? I see a crow there, but it's not coming down. He hasn't made the crossing yet, it's quite obvious. "A stone-cold heart" "guilty of a crime." "I won't..." "live this lie!" It won't come down, it's scared. "A wasted love..." "A wasted perfect life..." Please don't crowd here. Step back. Let the rituals continue. "fading before my eyes!" "Stone-cold heart!" "Wasted love!" "Fading before my eyes!" "Before my eyes!" Where's Ammu? Ammu left. Didn't she tell you? Where? I gave her what she needed. So she left. I've got something for you too. Don't mess with me! What did you do to Ammu? You started it... so you only end it first. Then I'll tell you what I did to her. - Hello? - Hey! I had to make an urgent trip to my hometown. I'll explain everything when we meet. I'm all good. Leave that Luke alone. Don't we all have secrets in our lives? Let him do his thing. Don't bother him. Listen-- Oh good God! Son... Come see this! Oh Lord! What did I just see! Anil! Son! Hey! How is 'Sir's' health now? Which Sir? Luke Sir! Didn't you know? Someone attacked him on the road yesterday. Yesterday night! Now he is in Dr. Chandran's hospital. [Dr. Chandran Calling] Ma... Waste has seeped into the pit and there's a stench too. Shall we lay Dileep elsewhere... and clean the pit? Ma! We will do whatever has to be done as per traditions, Ma. Let's not leave him there in the dirt. So you didn't see the assailant? Shall I write that in the report? Sir... I... I didn't see, Sir. It was dark. Ah... you came here on your scooter, right? I discharged him this morning. But couldn't find any acquaintance to send him home with. It's a small injury. But won't be right to send him alone. I remembered you when the nurse mentioned it. - You don't mind, right? - No. Drink some tea. Hold it. You haven't eaten anything since morning. Over there. Dig up some of the dirt there. It's not there? Asha! - Listen... - Yes? Amongst the bones from the pit, Dileep's skull is missing. Ma! Dileep's head is missing from the pit! Oh... sorry! I forgot about that. Thank you! Do you need any help? If you don't mind... some warm water would help. Move! So you are here at last! You scum! I worked really hard all this while just for this moment! Luke... please! Please listen. They're not buying your story. They're convinced that it was a break-in. But the fingerprints found on the weapon are a problem. Let's tell them about the person who got away. There was only one person. And I killed him! We can prove that the murder was in self defence. But the robbery... we can't prove it occurred. The case will go on for months. You know that! They think you killed Sophia. See... we can't blame them. Hey... listen! Calm down and sit! Hello! Are you awake? How are you feeling today? Are you in any pain? - Shall I call the doctor? - Will I die, Sister?! Not for now. But you did get a real thrashing! You find that funny?! What kind of a person must you be for someone to beat you like this?! You should see the person who did this to me! Stop laughing! Don't move your body like that. He was trying to kill me. He... Calm down please. Let me check which doctor is on duty. I'll be right back. Where on earth are you?! Should've killed me when you had the chance. What a blunder! So she is your weakness. You get enraged if she is hurt. Okay. Let's hurt her then. I will drag her here... and hurt her while you watch! Who are you, son? She'll be here in a moment. She is in the bathroom. Can I get you some tea? I asked her why she was not going to work. She stared me down! Occasionally she gets a little crazy like this. She says she is not well and holes up in her room. That dead husband of hers... is still on her mind. She hasn't moved on. You are still guarding her despite dying, huh?! What was that, Sir? Who are you? Don't mind him. He is a little cuckoo. Even if you tell him, he will not remember it. Oh no. You never listen, do you?! You are out to embarrass us! I thought I'd have some peace of mind once this man is old. But no! Back in the day, he was intolerable, Sir! He was in a fight every single day. He was a well-known goon of the time! He lied to me to make me marry him. I had no one to make enquiries on my behalf. What could I have done? Gotten a divorce? Oh! All that's for rich folks. Here women are a burden. People just want to do away with them. Once married a women's life is at the mercy of the husband. You've got to live like that for the rest of your life. And no matter what you go through nobody is looking out for you. But forget about me. My daughter's plight... that's what saddens me the most. How about I marry Sujatha? Huh! What was that again?! Let's think well and respond. Stop yelling. In my opinion, this is a good alliance. That factory and the house will remain with you... And you can continue to boss over these men! Will you ask him to get out? Or should I? Aargh! You will go through hell just like me. Mark my words! Here's a chance to escape it all. But you want to remain arrogant! Seems like you've blocked me. But try stopping a mother! Sir... what brings you here without any notice? I am going to marry Sujatha. I hope your blessings will be with us. People are saying all kinds of things! Is Sujatha getting married again? We haven't made a decision yet, Sita. We got a proposal and were thinking-- What's there to think? Why didn't you reject it immediately? But... it's her life. Let her decide. What do you mean? So if she agrees, you will get her married?! What is this?! How will my son bear this?! He left her everything he had. But Sita... she is still young! How long do you think she can remain alone-- Consider it God's will. Why can't she just live as my son's widow? Isn't that what women from good families should do? Or does everyone get remarried as soon as their husbands die? Our ancestors would have jumped into their husband's pyre! Do you even know that? If that was the case then me and her sick father should be the first ones to jump into a pyre and die. We are alive because she puts food on the table. Whatever she gets from all her hard work, she gives you a share. What else do you want?! She can't handle these burdens all by herself anymore. If she feels like she needs a partner, we will support her. We're not going to get hung up on family and status! You're getting married huh, kiddo? You seem to be getting beaten everyday. Is it a religious ritual?! I know who hit me, Sir. I actually saw him clearly. It was Satheeshan. - Really? - Yes! If you've done something wrong, just admit it. Don't make them beat you up. - Sir, it was indeed me. - Is that so?! Why Sir? Pray tell?! No point explaining that now. I slipped up. I beat him. What?! You enter a man's house, beat him to near death and say 'you slipped up'? - Entered his house?! - Hey! Somebody take him before I... Get out. What is your problem with him? Well... it was my fault. I forgot who I was playing with. Why did you beat him up? I beat him up, it seems! Is he actually a troublemaker? Do you know any other details about him? I have nothing that you want! I am screwed up here and you are... I heard his wedding has been fixed with your old friend... Sujatha. "Open the window and see what follows the wind!" "Up on the hill, I see nothing..." "that is still!" "My stories are not over, my stories are not over..." "Don't go!" "My stories are not over!" "My stories are not over, don't go!" "It's part of the truth." "I see the power lies in all of the tools!" "You see the moves I make, I got all of the moves!" "You feel my pain, I wish how bad, was it true!" He might look otherwise, but actually he's very affectionate. It's noon. Aren't you going to wake up? Aren't you hungry, Mom? I won't be able to eat today. I am fasting today. Sweetheart, what's taking so long? My son-in-law has gone into his room half an hour back. Come on out now. Go in and strike up a conversation. Why has he gone in already? It's not even 7 o'clock. I don't know. Go and ask him. I am off. Your father must have brought the house down already. Come on in. It's late. - Did your Mum leave? - Yes, she did. Dad gets a little mad when alone. Guess we'll leave it open. Who's there to watch anyway?! Where on earth are you? Did you see? Did you see me sleep with her? Don't you want to hurt me? Don't you? Shouldn't we tidy up this house? Sujatha, were you okay with marrying me? Yes. Nobody forced you, right? No, it was my decision. I was just asking. Good morning! Would you like some tea? Sir... both of you turned up here right after your wedding. Not going on a honeymoon? You could have told me when you left. I was looking for you everywhere. I had some urgent work here. Oh sure, go ahead. Don't mind me. Give me a moment. We could have taken a break before getting back to work here. We just got married. There are always people around here. We don't have any privacy here. Go home then. I'll come early. It's okay. I'll wait here. Sitting alone at home is boring. Where are you hiding?! You're peeling them, right? Pack these two sets into two different covers. Carry on! He won't let her out of his sight. They just got married, right... That's why. Hey Sir! Why don't you sit inside? It's really hot out here. You've been coming here everyday since the wedding, right? That's very good. It's good that you are keeping an eye on things. Mr. Babu, how do we get it shut again? Come on, Sir! You seem to be in great spirits today! Anil, son...! - Anil, dear...? - Yes Ma... you're up? What is it, Ma? Go and bring Adv. Joseph. Quick! Warm some water for my bath. - What is it, Ma! - Stop asking questions. Hurry up. You'll come there directly? Okay. Hello? Listen, come to the factory with Rajesh and the rest of our men. Something has come up. I'll tell you. Dileep transferred the factory to your name while you were his wife. Correct? But since you've married another man now morally you have no right over the factory. We can of course go to the courts and argue. But do we want to get into that? Shouldn't we settle it here? Should we get into a legal tussle and waste everyone's time? Who are you? Can't you see we are in a meeting? Please come back after a while. Well, this is my property. Oh, that's your second husband. Okay, whatever. So Sujatha you need to transfer the factory back into my client's... that is Dileep's mother's name. His mother is still his mother. That does not change, right? I can't do that. Dileep has been dead for two years now. Have you or Anil ever enquired what's going on here? Other than visiting to collect your share, nobody ever comes here. I run this place all by myself. Then... and now too. This is my property. Also... I really don't want to give it to your client. Sujatha... don't keep a tab on these things. Since he died, exactly how many times did you give us a share? You said the company's making a loss, there is a strike etc. and tricked us, and took all the profits. I let it go since you were after all my brother's wife. But now you expect us to be... silent again? I know you are around. Come on out, now. Let me get a good look at you. You found a rich man, and married him. That's your personal matter. Not our business. But then you also want my brother's property. That's bloody unacceptable! Please don't get violent. We can talk this out. But I am talking it out! Right, Sujatha? Welcome back! Aren't you going to do anything? They're coming down hard on your woman. Oh... but on the other side are your mum and brother. Blood is indeed thicker than water. So then of course your hands must tremble. Right? See... you need not interfere. We can sort this issue out through dialogue. I am the second husband, Advocate. Not the dead one. Do not touch me. I repeat. Do not touch me. Please don't touch me. Don't do anything, please. I'll have this shut down, Sujatha. Mark my words! It's personal now! He doesn't know whose feelings he hurt! Bloody fool! I'll get this locked up! Violence gets an applause here, huh?! That kid has suffered enough. Responsibilities, debts, and a sick father. You don't get involved and create more problems. In any case, I am done interfering in others' matters. Let them all suffer. Good that it had happened. That woman and her son had it coming for a while! My son-in-law is a man of steel! Hmm? Weren't you sleeping? You were acting? Something's wrong, Dad. Maybe it's just a feeling. But something is wrong. Check if it is sweet enough, dear. - I made some sweets. - Aren't you happy? Sweets? Dileep built that company with so much hard work. His own mother got it shut. And is distributing sweets. What kind of family is this?! Brother-in-law must be 'happy'! The pudding is really nice! So then... shall we go home? Hmm? Hey... don't be sad. At least, we will get some personal time now. Let's stay home for a few days. Hmm? That will be fun. Alright, I'll get it. What he says and does is different from what is within him. No matter how hard we try, it's impossible to figure it out. I wonder if he is living in the same world as us. Feels like he holds something against me. I felt that before we got married too. I told myself it was just a feeling and tried to make adjustments. But I am not able to! Drat! This fellow never answers his phone. Living at the edge of the world must suit your style, right Sir?! Sir... I wanted some information. Free of charge! Because I don't have money! You've been after Luke for a while. Found anything? Why are you suddenly interested in him? Something urgent came up. Tell me, please? I don't know anything, man! In Balan's case, he was on the suspect list. Apart from that... he is a nice man. Not a trouble-maker. Okay then I will... Fellows never let a man finish a job well and make some money! But he was right. I wasted a lot of time on Luke. Until... Luke himself showed me where to look. Ah... there you are. Dinner ready, Madam! Freshen up and come. I'll be done in just a bit. What are you looking for? Lost something? Huh? Come. Dinner's getting cold. This is actually... an English breakfast. This is all I know, that's why. What are you celebrating? Creating an issue for nothing and getting my company shut down? Or getting me to sit at home jobless? This is not the whole meal really. There's a few things to be added. For now, let's do with what we have. Tell me. What is going on within you? You want me to cook for you, take care of you give birth to some children and stay at home? Will that make you happy? How about you do this too... Make a prayer room with your idol in it. I will consider you as a god and pray everyday! Are you listening to me? You have nothing to say? "Don't show up at my door!" "You've been warned... before!" "I know your face!" "I've seen those eyes!" "Hypnotised.... by your games! Your mistakes!" You seem to be working. Can we step out for a conversation? If Sujatha hears us, my hard work will be down the drain. Dileep worked in Dubai for barely two years. But if you look at the money he spent here for the house and the factory he either won the Dubai lottery... or he must have been robbing people there. Well, he never won the lottery. Dileep was a smart crook. Until the time you arrived, I didn't suspect him of anything. This news is about a man named Shafi from Kollam. He was killed during an attempted robbery. While trying to get away, he hit a woman on her head and killed her. Her husband caught him and broke his neck. He died on the spot. Newspapers have only this much. Whose house was it? Who was the lady who died? Who is her husband? None of those details. No point looking for those either. I went to Shafi's house. He wasn't alone. There was another man with him. That's what the police there said. The other guy killed the woman but the blame fell on my son. If you are rich, you can do whatever. But... the house owner was stubborn in his stance that Shafi alone broke into the house. And when I asked them further, they seemed to know Dileep. Shafi had told them about this friend from Dubai. And have you concluded that it was me? The second blunder you made... Not sure who it is, But I have seen him. Oh yes, he had come here one day. But he left without saying a word. I won't blame you, Sir. What do you do if your enemies die before you can do anything? Wreck the lives of those dear to him. That's it! But I worked too hard for this! To remain silent and watch from the sidelines, you'll have to give me a fee. But... I get to decide how much it is. - And if I don't? - This gets broadcast! Sujatha is getting suspicious too, right? There is an unsolved case in town too. The Balan murder case. The crimes you did and those you didn't... will be all yours to defend. Just let me know when the money is ready. Hope you won't get ideas in the meantime. You shouldn't. I am a cop. Don't think I am here without a plan. You can take a guess as to where a copy of the evidence is. If I am missing for a couple of days, they will surface automatically. The only thing I don't understand is why you married Sujatha. You came for revenge, but fell in love with her, right? Lame! Is that what you figured out, Ashraf? What a pathetic cop you are! Do you have any idea how much he took from me? To build a house and buy a factory here in the middle of nowhere he hasn't spent a quarter of that money. I couldn't get him. But I need my money. I will return only after getting that. I thought she'll know where it is, so I married her. But what a waste! Why did he tell me that? He knows I will look for it. Sir... Ashraf Sir sent me. He lost the keys to his drawer. It's in that room. Ask me. What do you want to know? Ask me! I got your company opened. And I got it shut too! Sure, look at it that way. I told you not to go there everyday, right? Did you listen to me? Yes, I married you so you could do the household chores. I admit. But tell me, what was your plan? You had your eyes on my money, this house and the factory, right? Yes. I wanted it all. And me? You didn't want me? I don't know. Stop this madness! What will you do if I don't? You'll hit me? So if she's hurt, you'll show up. Right? Where are you off to? I am not done yet. Let go of me! Leave me! Let go of me! Leave me! Sorry, it was my mistake. Sorry! How dare you come home and say nonsense! Get out! - What are you doing?! - Move aside! Ma will speak. Step aside. I expected this. He loved his brother. When you said this out of the blue... he couldn't tolerate it. Where did Dileep keep the rest of the money? What's that, Sir? I mean... I know he wouldn't have splurged all the money he brought. He would have kept aside a little for safety. Did he tell you anything, sister? Sir... what are you even saying! If there was something like that, why would we be living like this? Dileep was just like this. Whenever I asked him, he said, 'I have barely any money, Sir'. 'I have debts' 'I am struggling to make ends meet.' I swear on my kids. Listen sister... I don't want it all. - Just a share! - Why don't you understand?! Okay. Up to you. I got some information and I came and told you. If you don't deal with it right, it's bound to get out. Even though Dileep is dead... you know what something like this can do. The family reputation will be ruined forever. None of you will be able to walk with your heads held high. You know how our townsfolk are. Anyway, he's dead. No harm in shaming him a bit. Sir! Please sit. Allow me a moment's breath, Sir. You know I am getting old. I can't handle it all. Let me look for it. Please sit. Get something for him to drink, dear. Or wait... I'll do it. - You want to host this man-- - You shut up! If you open your mouth till I ask you to... Get me?! Please sit, Sir. Please sit. You were right, Sir. A family's reputation can be ruined only once. That's it. After that everyone is better off dead. Their father... was having an affair with a Tamilian woman. I think you already knew that. Anil always said... 'Dad is going to leave us, Ma.' 'He will leave us for her.' I felt so too. If he did that when I was alive, wouldn't people think he left because I wasn't good enough? What would people think of me? Would I be able to face anyone outside? Just in case he ever left us like that, I bought some poison to kill myself. Thank almighty. I didn't have to do that. Once you decide to end your life you get a strange sort of courage. Something that makes you feel like you could do anything. I am his mother. I can't let go of him. Maybe he sinned. But are we the ones to punish him? God will do that. Other than that... I won't let anyone harm him any more. Forgive me, Sir! Sir! Anil! Get the car out. Sir! Hey... he's going to die! Get the car out, Dude! Oh no! Sir! Mom, he was a police officer! Anil... What happened, dear? Huh? What is it? Where is my son-in-law? 'Son-in-law'! Don't get me started! I can't manage with him anymore. I am done! He doesn't let me move. The moment I go out, his behaviour changes. He shadows me everywhere. It's like he wants to keep me in his pockets! It's almost as if he married me to irk someone! 'Mom', you please convince her. I'll make sure she doesn't come back. She's not going to listen to me. She wants to get separated. But you said there are no divorces here! That was back then! Today's girls will beat you with a broom! She said she won't return to that house. Alright. But she can come with me to Dubai, right? I made a decision last night. I am not really keen on living here. I woke up and thought of telling her, but couldn't find her! You mean... the Dubai in the Gulf? Yes, but it needs to be soon. I have some urgent work there. Oh. I don't think she will come. Is Sujatha around? I can try talking to her. I don't know where she is. The one who killed someone and the one out to kill are all playing with her life! Poor thing! What was her fault?! Never trust a good-looking man who's rich. Underneath, they are all crooks. - Hey... come here for a moment. - Hmm? - Come with me. - I'll be right back, dear. - What?! - What? Are you trying to console her or kill her? Enough. Give her some space. I never asked you why you thrashed him up! But that was a good thing you did. He cheated her... yes. But the other fellow... Dileep... hurt her. That would be difficult for her to bear. He's not going to stop. We must do something. Dileep and Shafi are our children, Sister. If they do a mistake, shouldn't we be the first ones to forgive them? He killed my husband. Destroyed my family. Anil is all I have now. He will kill him too. Help us, please! Consider us your family and come with us. I am grateful to you for one thing though. You made me realise who Dileep was. Otherwise, I would've had held him close to my heart forever. Goodbye! He will never see Sujatha again. Nor will he try to trouble her. The house isn't very comfortable. Kindly adjust, guys! You came to kill him... right Sir? To kill Dileep... Killing is old-fashioned. That thrill gets over in an instant. What would I do then? I would have taken good care of him. In a... cage. Would have thrown him a bone or two every now and then. And sometimes... he would have seen me and wagged his tail. Right, Anil? He knew you would come for him. He had no peace. He was always worried. Even if we asked, he never told us what was on his mind. When he died I thought... at least now my son will be at peace. But no! You wouldn't allow it. Whenever I get a feeling that everything in life is perfect I suddenly get scared. I was always like that. A feeling overcomes me... like something is about to happen. On a day like that... Dileep broke into my house. I got really scared. In one single hit... he killed three people. Why does a man like him need peace? He doesn't deserve it. You can't get him out of your head, right? I won't let that happen. He wouldn't leave either. The whole town still loves him. A lot of people still know me only as 'Dileep's mother'. That's the greatest blessing a mother can get. Right? What you are out to destroy... is that happiness of mine. The reputation of a dead man! Right? His popularity... fame! If there is anyone at all, who has even a strand of his memory... I will leave only after that too is destroyed. He is gone, Sir. Dead. He is six feet under. God avenged your pain for you. Isn't that enough? Why don't you put an end to it now? Not sure what God did. But I haven't avenged it yet. Don't I need a chance? Don't I deserve it more than God? Sir, forgive me. He is my son. Until I am alive, I must take care of him. Then there is my family... we really want to live in this town without being shamed. Aren't you guys an interesting family?! A mother and two children. Balan always used to say I have pampered the boys too much. True to an extent. They take after me. Dileep is me. And Anil is me! My children's' good and evil shades are all but me. They did everything for me. I admit. My kids robbed and killed for my sake. For me to be happy. For me to lead a comfortable life. I knew it. How could you be anywhere but here? Once this is done, where will you go? Since this is where it all began from... and therefore... this is where it should end too. Hey! Call Rasheed. They will do it. Don't want this to be on us. - Leave me, Ma! - Rasheed! Son! No! Anil... don't do it! Anil... come here. Listen to me... let it go! Come here... don't do it! Anil! Oh no... But we already knew Sita wouldn't be able to defeat him. Bringing down a man obsessed with the idea of revenge was never going to happen anyway. Done? Let's go. Hey... where on earth is Ashraf? Can't reach him. His wife has been calling me since morning. Sir... she'd like to file a complaint. I suspect Dileep was murdered. - Sir, kindly investigate it again. - What?! Who would've killed him? Dileep killed Luke's wife. In Dubai. All we needed to do was dangle a bait he'd claw onto. Must satiate his hunger, and hook him in too! We found this in Luke's house. Shashankan who had a change of heart, made a detailed confession to the police. For the murder of Officer Ashraf, Sita was named the first accused, while Anil was named the second. "Lost this game." "Playing by her rules." "Watch me fade!" "Swallowed in the dust." "I say these words as I leave this world." "You won't see me!" "You won't feel me!" "One step closer" "The end is here, you won't see me!" "You can't reach me!" "Hear my cries!" "Look into my eyes!" "Watch me fall." "One last time!" "I say these words as I leave this world." "You won't see me!" "You won't feel me!" "One step closer" "The end is here, you won't see me!" Balan's case got renewed momentum as well. Anil was named an accused in that too. Shashankan turned approver in the case. The funny thing is... Anil... now an accused in two murder cases was never seen again. Neither was Luke, who was being searched as per Sujatha's complaint. Sita was worried that Anil will be arrested for killing Balan. Hence, she poisoned Ashraf and killed him. This was the police's conclusion. I did it alone, Sir. I did it... for my son. Nobody asked which son. Neither did she say. When you have such devious children, mothers are fated to suffer like this. True! No cop there was smart enough to think that it could be the other way around. But again, some notions never change! Food. "One more time..." "I say these words as I leave this world" "You won't see me." "You won't feel me!" "One step closer, the end is here you won't see me!" Though it looks like Sujatha filed a complaint against Luke... it actually targeted Dileep. "I say these words as I leave this world..." "You won't see me!" Break it down, Murali! Don't need a single board in his name in our town! What an embarrassment to all of us! Guys like him could easily kill someone for money. "You won't see me!" "You can't reach me!" They're Sita's kids. The apple wouldn't fall far from the tree! But it's surprising how the entire family turned out to be like that. [Dileep Memorial Arts and Sports Club] But the other guy... is the real player! Who? "The end is near!" - Hey look! Isn't that him? - Yes... it's him! Guys, come. - Let's see what's going on. - Yeah. "Wasted... life" "on this fight." "Faced my demons... tonight!" "One last breath!" I am putting an end to being on the run. "One last try!" All that Sujatha has said... I admit doing it. "One more time!" And finally... I finished him off! He doesn't exist anymore! I own him. Sir... who is this man and what is he here for? Tell us! - Sir, we saw a man coming in. - We are still questioning him. Where are these media guys going?! Hey... push them all out! Close the gate. Do it now! Out... all of you! Step out! Out! Move! We're closing it. Pull the grill. Get out! Out! All of you. Media it seems! Hey... why don't you all understand?! We told you... step out. Please out! Get out! The man just can't seem to get enough of duping the people of this town! So he got what he came here for. He killed a guy who died a long time back. Yanked everything he had from its roots, destroyed his family and everything they had. Not even worms will make that house their home. There never will be another Dileep here. So then... is that why Luke came here? Who can say! How can we declare an accident to be be a murder because a man claims so? Because we seldom solve cases with our 'brilliance'. But I am very sure about this! Dileep's case was an accident. Then why did this man confess and get arrested? No one can really guess what he is up to-- - Sir! - Yes? That Sita... she hung herself! Oh good Lord! What a mess. Welcome back!
