Every purchase comes with a complimentary hot toddy with sage honey and a fresh lemon from the backyard. - Don't mind if I do. - They are delish. Allen doesn't mess around with this housewife thing. You should see his needlepoint. - It grounds me. I don't have the constitution for bargaining. You all are adorable. You ever gonna grow up and get hitched? - Ha ha.

I'm not lying. I'm fine. Oh, my God. You're not a cyborg, Nina. You went through a breakup. But you know what? Whatever. You do you. You're in your prime. Allen's history. So, yeah, go out there and ruin some dicks. Wow. I'm changing the subject. How are my baby girls? They suck. Don't ever have kids. Oh, no. What happened this time? I came home with a Frosty, but it had a plastic straw in it. And the girl starts screaming at me like, I don't know, I murdered a sea turtle in front of her own children. Oh. How was the Frosty? Oh, so worth murdering that sea turtle. Alright, let's go up to my place. I want to change out of these work clothes. How was work, by the way? Did you make any big deals with any big-deal celebrities? Who cares? I don't want to talk about work. Yeah. I don't care. I was just being nice. That's what I thought. Remember that girl I was dating, Cleo? - Yes. - We dated for three months. And when we broke up, she lit my shoes on fire? My fucking Georges, man. My 23s. You remember that shit? I said I remember. You date a girl for, like, five years. And when you break up, there's no fight, no blowout, nothing. Yeah, but we never fought, man. You know this. We just sat down and talked about it and decided it wasn't working out, so we called it. I don't see what is so hard to understand about that. Because it doesn't make sense. Do you understand this? I don't. But I am willing to learn. I don't know why I said that. Luckily, it won't be necessary for the job, William. Disagree. You've got to teach this to all men everywhere, right? Yes. Y-Yes. Well, I think that concludes the interview. Okay. Thank you so much again for the opportunity. I'm a really big fan of you guys, so, you know, I would kill to work with you. I mean, not literally, obviously, but, like, you know. - Not literally? What? He's fucking with you, Willie. Fucking with you, man. Hey, look, you did a good job, man. Alright, let us talk it over and we'll get back to you. Thanks again. Thank you. - Watch the chair. - Yes, right. I dig him. He's like a chocolate Clark Kent, and his work is impressive. Yeah, he's a little green, though, right? So? I say we hire him. We need some young blood if we're gonna be collaborating with Uniformity L.A. Don't give me that, "Oh, well, we need to talk about it." Look, I'm telling you, I see a huge opportunity. They be making moves in the interior-design space, bro. Yeah, I hear you, man. Can we just pump the brakes a little? It's kind of a lot right now. Maybe I can think about it over the holidays. Is that cool? Totally fine. It can wait. Thank you. Now... can we please get me a drink? You ain't said nothing but a word. Let's get the fuck out of here and get drunk. Right. It's the holidays. So that should give you plenty of time to work out your best and final offer because if we start the new year and you haven't met my client's demands, she will be taking the studio gig. Okay? Merry Christmas. Done. Officially done. Ahh, now I just need my cocktail. Mason works Friday nights, and he makes the best... What? What? - Nothing. - Something. It's not gonna be the easiest garment to take off. Oh, Jesus, Chels. Are you a nun or something? Hey, did you get on a dating app finally? Yes, but I haven't checked it yet. What? Whip that shit out. Fine. Here, you can look. Wow. A lot of power. Nina, you have 50 messages. - Really? - 50. Oh, my... Oh, come on. They're just... They're all trying so hard, though. Like this dude. He's got better eyebrows than I do. You know, I appreciate that. It means he manscapes. Wait. Whoa. Look at this guy, Alexander. Hello! - Is that a real person? - He is delicious. Yes! There she is. There's my little vixen. Alright, settle down. Okay? You know what? This is great right here. Thank you so much. Hey, Nina! Nina! Stop living in denial. - Denial of what? - Dick. You're living in dick denial. - Wow. I can't with you. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Stop. Listen. Real talk. I spend my life buried under two little demons who are sucking me of my life force every given second. I love my husband. You know I love my husband, but he's basically just a pile of foreskin at this point. By the way, Dex isn't circumcised. I can't believe I never told you that. It's a really long, infuriating story. Anyway, look, I don't mean to be that psychic friend who's like, "Yes, girl, get laid so I could live vicariously through you." But, yes, girl, get laid so I can live vicariously through you. I need this, okay? I need something to make me feel alive. No one sucks on my tits anymore, which is a shame, because I was an "A" before I got pregnant. And now I'm a "G" and it's a waste! Please, I need you to help me. And you can by boning the shit out of that guy and giving me every detail. - Should I just film it for you? - Oh, my God. I wouldn't say no to that. - Oh, wow. Oh, you were joking? I mean, it seems reasonable. I'm your best friend. - How much do you love me? - It depends. Why? Well, it's just my girl, Angela's, coming over your house on Sunday, and she's bringing a friend... A recently single friend. Oh, shit. I forgot to tell you. We're watching football at Nina's. - Nina's? - Yeah. Wait. Please don't tell me you gave her the flat screen. Game day's her thing. It makes sense. Hey, man, none of this makes sense. I'm not gonna hate-bang some guy to get over Allen. Okay? Oh, my God. Why the hell not? Because there's nothing to get over. It's a gorgeous piece of human innovation. It's easy. We just... Let me guess. You talked it out. - Hey, Mason. - You can be an adult... What's up, Nina? First time without... - Hey, Mason! - Allen? Ew. What the fuck are they doing here? Oh, sh... Yeah. And so when your order comes up, you just grab your food here. If you have any questions, just ask Elena. Oops. - Oopsies. Oopsies. Elena runs the kitchen. Elena. Elena. New server, Autumn. Autumn. Elena. Hi. I love your apron. Oh. She's shy. Excuse me. I just have one quick question. - Yeah? - Sorry. Do... Do a lot of celebrities come in here? I mean... yes. Shh, shh, shh. We do not think of them as celebrities per se. They're customers, just like everybody else. Yeah? It's just that, um, I'm a singer... - Oh, no. - ...and I act, too. And my cousin says that I have the perfect complexion for the screen. And he is an influencer and a pastor. Okay. Look, I am aware that most people working here are pursuing other passions, but I just want my employees to keep their pursuits to themselves. I don't want to come across like a... - Like a biscuit boy. - ...lame-o. But, you know, I run a tight ship. Yeah? - Captain. - Dick! What the fuck? Jaz. Hey. I ain't working the bar on New Year's? Oh, just because Mason covered your shift last week. And so since he did us a favor... Bullshit, that's my shift, and you know it. Okay, maybe we could talk it over with Mason and see... You're the manager. Change it. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm the manager. - Good! Who are you? Oh, hi. I'm Autumn. I love your shirt. Of course you do. It's fucking adorable. You from Florida? - How'd you know? Low-rider jeans, baby. - Oh. - They're Silvers. - They're jeans. - Wow. Silvers. - Maybe I should get her some. - Don't do that. Tyler. Everything okay? We might have a problem. I'm not going anywhere. Uh, yes, you are. This is my bar. And I brought Chelsea out for us to have a good time tonight so you and Milan can go somewhere else. Well, that sounds lovely. And that's actually why Milan and I are here because this is actually my bar. What makes you think that? Maybe because I found it, so I have first dibs. That's hilarious. You stopped in to take a piss, Allen. You were literally just following your dick. Right. My dick found it first, and I'm attached to my dick. - Boom. - What am I looking at? Didn't you hear? Allen and Nina broke up. Oh, no, man. They're so great together. And now they're over there trying to see who gets to stay a regular here. - They famous? No. This is Autumn, our new server. This is Tyler, head of security. - Hi. - Hi. Not famous. Just two of our favorite regulars. Allen, you know how much I love this place. Why can't you just let me have it? I love it here, too. And I let you have everything, including the 80-inch flat screen. I didn't ask you for things that you cared about, like the bar cart or tools or the surfboards. Those are literally things you never use. And by the way, who doesn't care about an 80-inch flat screen. - Milan. - What's up, Chelsea? - Still vegan? - Only on the weekdays. I'm Keto starting Fridays at 5:00 p.m. - I want my bar. - What? I said I'm Keto starting Fridays at 5:00 p.m. Keto. You heard Keto? Yeah. No, I heard what you said. They even named a cocktail after me. Yes, as a joke. Because you made changes every time you ordered it. Hmm. It needs more gin. Oh, my God. Too much gin. Do you use fresh lemon? Mm. There it is. There it is. There it is. You're so oblivious, you don't even realize you're saying it. It's amazing. Ask Mason. Okay. Well, at least it's not as bad as the Allen. Oh, very convenient. What, pray tell, is the Allen? - Your hugs. - My hugs? What's wrong with my hugs? I'm from Montana. We hug. Yeah, but yours are weird. Like creepy-uncle weird. Unh. Unh. Unh. - Wait. That's creepy? - Oh, yeah. But it's just a goodbye squeeze to let you know the hug's over. Or you can let go like human people do. - Talk about oblivious. - You know what? If you and Chelsea want to paint the town red in your fancy skydive outfit, why don't you just go to the Saddle Ranch? Well, why don't you and Milan go troll for sluts at a nightclub in your decade-old dad jeans? - Okay, I think you need to... - Tell me to calm down, Allen. I fucking dare you. - I'm just saying, I think you probably need... - Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, uh, that's enough. Let's go to the patio. - What? - You heard the man. No. Guys, we're open. Someone has to watch the bar. New girl, you ever bar tend before? - I'm a fast learner. - Good enough for me. Let's go. No. Maybe you should work for me. Patio. Everybody off to the patio. - No free pouring. Anybody need anything? Ah, okay. Alright, guys. We love you both. So let's figure something out. Tyler, you are the mediator. What do you got? It feels best to find a compromise that serves both. I say we make a team effort and we all toss our solution. There are no bad ideas. I'll start. How about if we divide up times, switch up nights? We're not quibbling over visitation rights. It's a fucking bar, not a kid. Okay, then, well, what if we let the staff vote? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That might put my staff in an uncomfortable position. - I'm fine with it. You guys? - Yeah. Okay, then. Maybe anonymously. Secret ballots. - Count 'em up. - Okay, great. All those in favor of my man Allen staying? Allen! - Wh... - Don't guilt my golf buddy. Okay. Why the fuck did you vote for him? Oh, it's financial. I clean him up every month on poker night. - Thanks, Jaz. - Thank you, Allen. Okay. Okay, everyone for Nina. - Sorry, Allen. - It's okay. Nina introduced him to his wife. Where did she just come from? Niners fans ride and die together. Okay, well, that leaves Dick. What say you? Yeah. I... Well, I... It's against company policy. Hey. Sorry to bother you. Mason, what is in a Cape Cod? - It's a vodka cran. What? Why don't they just ask for that? - Welcome to Los Angeles. - Okay. Oh, were you all doing the best of three? What the hell's the best of three? Oh. So at my last bar job in Tampa, there would be lots of bar fights and stuff. So the owner would just have people do a best of three competition, and the loser was 86'd. Anyway, have fun. That might fly down in Florida, but not here. Right? Also not very fair to Nina. And why is that? 'Cause I was literally a college athlete. You played baseball at a D-3 school. Okay? I'm an attorney. I fight for a living. Bring it. Okay. Fine. Let's do this. Okay. Okay, guys, guys, guys, wait, wait, wait. Let's just take a second here. Okay? Look, I am thinking of a number 1 through 11. You know, they have been coming here for years. - Ohh. - Seems fair. Tyler, what do you say? It does sound like a balanced approach. - Well, who am I to argue, then? - Okay. Okay. Okay. I see what's happening here. But this is a business. I'm sorry, but the answer is no. And that's my final word. How does it work? First we have people write down challenges for Tina and Dan. - Nina and Allen. Then put them in a hat, mix them up. Flip a coin, see who goes first. Y'all are serious. The winner gets to pick the first challenge and whoever wins best two out of three gets to stay. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. - Ladies first. Big Wheel races. - Yes! Yes! - You! Wait. What's that? - Haven't you been here before? - Oh, no, I'm sorry. I've been busy keeping two people alive for the past six years, so I don't have time to fuck around all weekend like you. You could've just said you haven't seen it. Damn. I guess I'm gonna go fuck myself over here. It's a race. One lap around the bar and then you chug a beer in that. Oh, Jesus. I have been missing out. Well, then let me get you up to speed, because this here is my thing and Nina knows it. Okay, well, whatever. I get to choose our drink. None of your IPA nonsense. Whatever helps take the sting out of your defeat. Huh? Huh. Say it again, say it again. Alright. Good luck, homie. Do I look like I need luck? You okay? You need me to kill anyone? No, I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve. Ooh. - I'm good. - Okay, bye. - Go, team! - Alright, here we go. One lap, one beer. Are you ready? - Your fly's down, Allen. - Get set, go! - Sure it is. When did you know my fly was down? When you came through the door, you lumbering dipshit! Gentle, gentle, gentle. [Voice distorted Someone needs to be done! Here we go, Nina. Come on. - Oh! - Ha ha! Yeah! Yeah! Oh! Whoo! I'm trying, Tyler! Cheers, darlin'. Oh, come on, man. Something wrong, Allen? Cider. Yeah, that's right. Hard cider. Oh, my God. I love this. I have no idea what's happening, but I fucking love this. Did I ever tell you about the Thanksgiving Day massacre? You did not. - Oh, fuck. - Fuck. This is a bad idea, Allen. What? It's just cider. Consider it my dessert. Yeah. This is a day for gluttony. - Oh! - Oh! Boom! - Oh! - Oh! - Game over, bitch. - Why? Why? She got both balls in the same cup! She wins! You got to drink 'em all! - Drink up. - Happy Thanksgiving, Allen. Told you I had some tricks up my sleeve. Cheers, Allen. Go! Go! Take control, man. It's all in your head. Go! Go, Nina. You can do this. You can do this. Go. It's so sweet. Why is it so sweet? Stop fucking talk and drink! Chug! Chug! Chug! - Oh, shit, he's catching up. Open your throat and toss it back. - Oh, you are being a pussy. - That can't be a thing. Trust me, I was in a sorority. I put things in my throat all the time! Put the damn thing to your lips, man. Allen! Allen! Yeah! - Fuck! - That was awful. Ugh. Tastes like Smarties mixed with Pedialyte. Tiny bubbles. One down and one more to go. - Yeah! - Oh! - Oh! Whoa. This is a brand-new shirt. Uh... he didn't finish. - What? - She's right. Y'all are chugging one on one. If anybody yaks, they got to chug a new one. Down the hatch. - Please no. - Nina, go, go. - Go, go, go! - Winner! - Winner! Yes! Yes! That's what you get. That's what you get. You little bitch. - Okay. Okay. Give the man some room. So mean. Come on. I love you so much. You were so great. Jaz. Jaz. Hey. Hey. How are you? - What's up? What's up? Yeah. Could you take care of that, please? It smells like all the bad things. Right? Together. - Yeah. Yo, Florida. - Yes. Job security. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Taking care of, boss. Can we not do this? Milan knows all the cool, new bars. You can literally pick any one you want. Why fight for this place? - Okay, so you're a crazy person. - I'm a realist. They're basically mini lions who were never domesticated. They only allowed people to give them free food and shelter. And one day, I believe they will kill us all. Happy Valentine's Day. - Happy Valentine's Day. Okay. So you're not a cat person. No. Why are you? They're low maintenance and they catch mice and I hate mice. - Oh, thanks, Jaz. - Thanks, Jaz. Mm-hmm. Well, if we ever get a pet, it's gonna be a dog. Sorry. Or a pig. Hey. If it's good enough for George Clooney, it's good enough for me. That's what I'm saying. Wait a minute. Did we order this? - Um... - Hey, Jaz. - What's up? - So we didn't order... - Don't trip. Elena's got you. So just sit back and enjoy. I think maybe we're regulars now? Hmm. Sweet. I guess I'm just a glutton for punishment. Alright. Well, it's your funeral. Guys, check that one out. Just remember to be respectful, Cameron. Oh, of course. Whatever you say, bro. Round two, baby. Here we go. Wah, wah, wah. Yo, how's Dick holding up, by the way? I mean, he popped open his Tums, so won't be long before he asks for his first drink and then we can finally break a chill. By the way, where's my... Oh, I got you. I love you, man. Mm mm mm mm mm. Saw that. Uh-oh. Are you jealous, Tiffany? Jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to the genius. Damn. Did you just make that up? I saw it on a mug in Venice. That's a pretty insightful mug. It was in Venice, so it was $50 and it didn't have any alcohol in it. So... - That's criminal. Well, I don't have any mugs, but I do make a mean cocktail. - Well, that's more like it. - Alright, I shall return. Okay. Yah. What does fate have in store for you? Blind man's darts? What are them? Alright, y'all, so it's pretty straight forward. Three darts each. Your partner tells you where to aim. Highest total wins. Uh, Jaz. Pardon me. Hey, guys. Very exciting. Jaz, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Hold up, guys. It's just gonna be... I'm just not super comfortable with the whole blindfolds thing. You know, it's a bit of an insurance nightmare. Right? So might I suggest... - Hold. 'Sup, water? - Hi. Captain. So I don't know the numbers of any of the tables. Could you show me? - Oh. They need drinks, like now. Okay. My bad. You were saying? Well, actually, Jaz, I would rather her shadow you and you take over. - Do you want to train her? - No, I want you to train her. - Right. - Right. - Great. We're in agreement. W... Ow. So it looks like the woman over at seat 23 is stealing copper cups again. - Did you say again? - Did it last week. Told her this behavior is gonna lead her down a dark path. Oh. She doesn't want to listen to me. She might listen to you, though. Good luck with that. Alright. Let's do this. Alright, everybody. Let's play some fucking darts, y'all! Whoo! Yeah! Ooh. There. Okay, so you're looking at a large circle, and there's a circle... I know what a dartboard looks like, Chelsea. Tell me where to aim. - Oh, my God. I'm just trying to paint a picture for you. I haven't done this before. Okay? You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm just stressed. - I'm stressed, too. Okay. Just use visuals that we both know. Okay. Okay. Oh, you know my dining room table? - Uh-huh. - Okay. It's... The distance between you and the dartboard is the length of that. I can totally see that. Okay. - Yeah! - Damn it. - So my dining room table... - No, I get it, Chelsea. Hi. I'm the manager. My name is Dick. Oh, of course it is. Slight breeze blowing south by southwest. We're inside. Trust me, it's subtle, but it's there. Visualize. Execute. Ho ho! 6 points! - Yeah! - Way to go, Allen! No one makes it on the first try. I feel like Luke Skywalker. I'll be your Obi-Wan, bitch. Ah! You know, it's actually about Allen's height. So picture his face and hit it. Oh. Fuck. So close. It's okay. We still have one more. Listen, if I could just have our property back, I'd really, really appreciate it. - I-I don't have your prop... - I think... Maybe in... - No. - No, just by an accident. - I need you to watch your tone. Right. Okay. Put yourself in the same place as you were before. Alright? You got to believe in yourself. Believe. - Jesus! - Shit! Definitely a breeze. Yeah, definitely, yeah. Don't forget. It's your last dart, Nina. What is that supposed to mean? Nothing. Just make it count. Wait, wait, Nina, wait. - Oh! - Oh! Yes! What's that, a 40 to your 6, Allen? You better make it count. Just like Colby. The more you talk shit, the better she performs. R.I.P., Mama. Also, if you knew that, why in the shit would you speak? - I am leaving. - Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. - You're... You're touching. I-I apologize. I cannot let you leave. I just... If you could just hand me back my mugs, I promise I will not press charges. Fair? What did you say to me? Don't worry, Allen. It'll be over soon. Who knows? Maybe they'll name a cocktail after you. Oh, or maybe they'll make special Allen koozies. Oh, yeah, that's good. You know, to commemorate your creepy hug. Hey, stay focused. Right? I want you to see the win in your future. Okay? Be the dart. I want you to fly. Okay? Fly like the wind. Fly like a hummingbird. You know, searching at the center of that sweet nectar. Right? I want you to be... - I simply... - Stay. Easy. Everybody, easy. Please with the monks. - Hey, stay. Easy. I got this. I got this. Can you help, please? Yes! Here's your mugs! - No!!!! - No!!!! I... I am certified on Yelp. - Oh, boy. - And you and all of you are going down in flames, motherfucker. Yes, because I know... only. Everybody, it's all fine. Don't take... - Oh, God. Don't... just stay. - No. I'm gonna take a chair dip. Give me that thing. The copper thing. That better be real, Dick. - Don't hand it to her, please. - Just put it on the tray. You do not need the pizza cutter. - Don't follow me, Dick. - Okay. - Oh, crazy. Is it heavy? - I-I... Wonder what her story is. Mason, can I have a... See? This is what I'm talking about. You always know what people need. This is a great quality for a manager. People listen. You want another one? Yeah. Okay. So where were we? Out of wood. And he hit the bull's-eye before that crazy lady blew up the board. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What bull's-eye? What? You saw it. Both of you did. I don't know what I saw. Nina, come on. Don't be like... Like what? I know you don't like to lose, but you don't have to stoop to her level. Oh, so now I'm a factor in this, okay? Yeah. What the hell does that even mean? - You know exactly what it means. - I'm what, I'm what, Allen? I'm outspoken. I'm opinionated. I'm a lot. What? What sexist bullshit thing am I specifically? Tell me. It's not sexist. You're not a nice person, okay? I'm just being honest. Sorry. No, no, no. you don't get to talk about my best friend like that ever. You hear me? - I won that game. - You can't prove it. What is this, court? Forget it. Whatever. I pick a different challenge. I'm not doing this one again. Fine. What are you doing? We have him right where... Stop. He won. You know he did. Still, he doesn't get to make my best friend feel like an asshole. To be fair, I am kind of an asshole. Yeah, but only I got to say that. Hey. Way to stick to your guns, man. I didn't want to bring this up, but Uniformity L.A. reached out again. What are those ass clowns applauding? - Hmm. - Oh, my God. Message Alexander. Get him here. - No. - Oh, my God. You don't have to fuck him. At least not yet. It's for leverage. Imagine the look on Allen's face when he sees you with that demigod. He will fold like a lawn chair. All's fair, hmm? And they're talking about giving us marketing dollars for the next two years. That's huge. I mean, we got to sit down with them before they change their minds. Uh, Milan, I just have bigger fish to fry right now. So if we can talk about that after the holiday... Okay. Yeah. Okay. But first thing after... You okay? Whoa. That was fast. Thirsty much, Alexander? Christ, I'm sweating. Oh, my God. I cannot wait to see the look on Allen's face when he walks in. Nina, hey. What now? I was way out of line back there. I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. Thanks. Still gonna kick your ass, though. Let's get to it. Alright. Human bowling. Human? As opposed to what? Alright. Who's ready for the showdown?! Human bowling. Nice choice. I didn't write the damn thing. I have a hunch who did. So, Elena I just happened to have one of these in her van? Okay. Hey, this is fun. I feel like I'm loading you into, like, a space shuttle. Like, well, Like a catapult or something? Well, I'm glad you're having fun. Yes. Who knows? After this, Allen might be out of the running. Oh, Chelsea, I am not hoping he'll die. Just that he'll go to the E.R., something like that. Oh, my God. - Just the E.R. - Alright. Come on, Milan, send it or me. Three, two, one. Engage! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, yes! Four pins, baby! You crushed it, man. Hey, man, you was like a red fireball, man. Hey, I was scared, man. I almost shit myself. Great fucking roll. Oh, my God. That dude is so right. This is amazing. I can't thank you enough. This is the best Christmas present ever. No, no, no. That's not going to be... That's not going to be... It's not going to that bad... Bad for you like that, no. Milan, get back here and help me get out of this thing. This thing freaks me out. Um, I'm the one that's strapped into this nightmare. Okay? Just aim straight. It can't be that hard. - Okay, okay. Uh, alright. It's my time. Uh, I'm not going to count, I guess. I'm just gonna... I'm gonna go for it. - Okay. - Sorry, I haven't... I'm... I'm... I'm really triggered right now. You know, I had this uncle who went on this homemade roller coaster in Germany, and it messed up his inner ear fluid permanently, and it gave him vertigo. And now he's in a wheelchair. - This is not the time, Chelsea. Okay, okay. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay! 4-3, our winner! You having fun, man. I mean, nothing matters. You know, some thing matters. Like my new year shift. Hi. Hi. Oh, I'm so sorry. Hi. Well, that sucks. That sucks so bad. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Oh. Oh, it's Dex. Do you mind if I...? - Yeah, it's fine. Tell him I said hi. Hey, loser. I hate you. I hate it so much. Let me help you out of that. Okay. Hey, hon. How's the girl's night? Oh, we're on the way to our second gang bang, so we're running kind of behind. That's nice. Hey, don't drive daddy's suit, please. Thank you. So, the girls want to watch a documentary on the floating trash island. Do you know where we keep the Apple remote? 'Cause... Thanks. Did you spit in this? Well, yeah. Looks like they're enjoying the show. Totally. No way. There's a remote on my phone. Are you sure about that? Yes, for fuck sake. Okay, just go away. Let me say goodnight to the demons. Hey, girls, come say goodnight to Mommy. - Hi, Mommy. - Where's Auntie Nina? - We miss you. - Are you coming home? Are you? - Hi, my nightmares. I barely remember you, and Nina's dead, and hopefully not. Oh, my God, Chelsea. You were right. Girls, I got the TV to work It's almost damn time, Dad. - Yeah, Dad. - Love you, Mommy. Yeah, you better make us breakfast, Mom. - Bye. - Bye. Hey, word to the wise. Condoms don't do shit. Want to be safe? Just stick to anal. I'm experimenting here, but don't hold back. I want your honest opinion. I'm going to give you my honest opinion. Alright. My Lord. - Yes. You're like a mad scientist. - I aim to please. - I can see that. Well, when you open your own spot, this one goes on the menu. - My own spot? Uh... - Yeah. You're cute, but crazy. Is that crazy? What? You're good at it, so why not? I mean, you could finally be free to do your own thing. Oh, this is freedom. Actually running a bar? My days would be consumed with admin bullshit, and I'd miss out on all the fun. Like tonight, not to mention all the interesting people like you. Well, I guess some of us have to keep the party going, right? Precisely. Excuse me. - Okay. Looks like you're having fun. Bro, she's rad, man. Gone a couple of dates now. - Okay. I met a lot of girls, but I think I found a match. She is fine with the capital F. - Oh, my God. - Give me some. Good job. Yes, indeed. Yeah. What do you want? - Give me a couple of beers. - Oh, okay. Oh, hold on. And a charge.- - Yeah. - People here are so nice. - Just remember, hip pocket. - Hip pocket. - Yeah. - Okay, I'm not going to forget. Alright, I'll be right back with your drinks. - Hey, Autumn? - Yeah. You know that guy? That is a talent agent, and he says he wants to hip pocket me. Hip pocket. How cool is that, Sam? This is why I keep the suit on. Actresses are everywhere. I guarantee she hooks us up with a round every time we're here. At least till she gets fired. This place is fast. It's going to get even better. Was talking to Dick about bringing in some live music. What now? So, I've been working with some musicians, and they're looking for a spot to test out their new songs. And this place would be perfect. Think of how awesome it would be here with live music. A lot of places have live music. This place has its own thing. You don't want to mess with that. I'm not trying to mess with it. I'm trying to help it evolve. Everything has to evolve, Allen, or it dies. Not if you take care of it. What is that supposed to mean? Oh, look, it's Allen's vestigial pal. Hey, jokes on you? I don't even know what vestigial means? Damn it, that's actually effective. What's up, homie? You okay? Yeah, yeah. Um, let's just, uh, pick the next challenge and get this over with. Yeah, agreed. Round three? Sick. Alright, let me drop this, and I'll grab the hat. Excuse me. Any of you know where the bathroom in this place is? Allow me. It's a challenge where we see who can get the most phone numbers in one hour. Oh, you are so fucked. Alright, save it, save it. So, it's five minutes till midnight. Why don't we start the clock, then? Oh, perfect, because I want to get a drink before the grand finale. You know what, Nina? We should leave them alone to brood over the inevitable. Mm-hmm. You know, I do feel sorry for you, Allen. But I love how savage she is. It's fucking hot. Thanks, Jaz. Oh, no. Again, thank you, Allen. See you in five. Hey, when's your Uber Meats arriving? - I didn't order any food. - No, Alexander, Uber Meats Oh, oh, oh. He said 11:30, so any minute now. This is going to be glorious! Look, there's no reason to freak out. Dude, I haven't even thought about talking to a woman in five years. Look, it's all about confidence. Just act like you were talking to William. That was an interview. It's not the same. Yes, the fuck it is. Now, look. Drink up, man. Chug that shit. Man up. So, listen. Now, I saw you over there talking to my friend, Autumn. Now, she's new to the city, so I just want to make sure you're being honest with her. Are you her dad? Just show me the bathroom. I advise you to listen to me. Or what? What are you going to do? Nothing. But I can't say the same thing about her. Shit. See, I'm a pacifist. But my friend Elena here, she's, um... What the fuck? It's fair to say that she's not. - Pardon me, miss. - Oh. Hi. I lied to you. I'm an assistant. I can't do anything for your career personally. Mostly I just get coffee. I'm not allowed to answer the phone. In here is my email. If you message me, I'll set up a meeting with my boss. She can actually help you. No guarantees, but I'll do my best. Also in here is a check with a 30 percent tip. Thank you for your excellent service. Good day. I love L.A. Alright, keeping this on the DL for obvious reasons, but this is it, y'all. Midnight, the witching hour. You both have until 1:00 A.M., last call, Whoever gets the most numbers claims victory. Wingmen are highly encouraged. Now, the loser doesn't have to go home, but they can't stay here. Got it? Alright, go make mama proud, bitches. Hey, do you mind if we join you? It's a free country. Allen, don't pay attention to them. Alright? Good your head in the game. Come on. Yeah? Black leather jacket, that's her. Um, hi. Hello. Hi. Hey, how... How you ladies doing? My name's Milan. This is my buddy, Allan. Would you guys mind if we have a seat? So, what are you drinking? Wouldn't you like to know? She would. That's why she asked. - I'm just messing with you. - Oh. Or am I? Oh. - What's happened? - I have no idea. Sorry. I just, uh... Um, you're very pretty, and I'm sure you get this all the time, but I just want you to know I'm not, like, a serial killer or anything. Real high bar you're setting there. It just seems like it would be exhausting, and my job is already... Takes a lot of effort. Slight improvement. Still not great. What do you do for work? Oh, he's... He's a carpenter, yeah. We have a business together, so... I've never met a carpenter before. We're not all like Jesus, but I do enjoy fish. Yeah, that didn't feel right. So, is... is this part of your competition? We have eyes. You and your ex are in some battle royale for the bar. Is this is part of it? Uh... Yes, it is, it is. We're supposed to get as many phone numbers as we can in one hour. So, are you single or...? It's a complicated question. But it's really not, like, at all. Oh, I get it. Yeah. You're funny. You should, um, get my number. Slow down. Buy me a drink first. Okay, yeah. No, I can't pretend anymore. - Oh, thank Christ. - This is... It feels like we're stuck in some sort of douche who's on first time loop. Yes, thank you. Wha... Wait. You're leaving? Oh, I don't know. Are we? - Are we leaving? - Or maybe we're staying. Maybe we're staying and going at the same time. Yeah, we're just messing with you. - We're messing with you. - It's very complicated. It's really complicated, but we're going to go or we're going to stay, but we're going to go. - Uh, are we going to stay? - Like, Oh, my God. We're going to go. - You're terrible. - Yeah. - Bye, guys. Look, I'm sorry. I'll just... I'll get out of here. - Hey. You want my number or not? - Uh, yeah. I mean, yes. - Yes. - For sure. - Give me your phone. Okay. I like coming to this bar, so here's the deal. If you win, try this again. Maybe work on some game. That's a big maybe, but... My advice, chill the fuck out. Will do, Amanda. Chill the fuck out. Dude. - Dude. What do I do now? - Do the same shit again. Do it again, do it again. Yeah. Well, there's a twist. - Damn it. - Okay, where's Alexander? He's supposed to be here. I don't know. Fuck, fuck. Oh, hey, that bro clearly wants attention. - Alright. - Let's move. Just don't think. Do whatever it takes to get his number. Grab his dick if you have to. - I'm not gonna grab his dick. - You want me to grab his dick? - Nobody is grabbing dicks. You got a thing with dicks, girl. - Hi. - Hello. And that right there, that's only some of his work. You should swing by the shop sometime. I can build you something. Not bad, Allen. So, I work in entertainment law. I'll take a mojito, no sugar. Make sure the glass is clean this time.

Alright, dudes. Last call. Let's get these fuckers out of here because it's that time, and daddy needs a cigarette without getting dirty looks. You know what I mean? Hey, could you do me a favor first? Mm, what's that? Never call yourself daddy in my presence ever again. Yeah. Hey, slut. How are you feeling? I'm feeling... feeling great. So good. Why do you ask? I'm sorry that I roped you into this. I know tonight was not what we had planned. Oh, fuck off. This was the most excitement I've had since the girls were born. And that was a crazy time. Three nurses quit. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. Thanks. You know, it's funny. Until an hour ago, I wasn't worried about being single. I know I'm awesome. But if tonight was a preview of single life in my thirties, I mean, every guy out there was a fucking joke. And not to mention that this will be the first holiday without Allen in five years. I don't know. All of a sudden, the future looks so bleak. Well, that was melodramatic, and some slippery slope bullshit. Look, you had one bad night at a fucking bar. Yeah, L.A.'s full of pretentious dip shits, but you're here. So if you're here, there must be other guys who feel the same way you do. And they're going to love the shit out of you, because you fucking deserve it. I love you. I love you, too. I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but I got to bounce. - Crisis at home? - No, Dexter locked himself out of the house again taking out the trash, and he's at the neighbors waiting for me. He can't wake up the girls. No, he doesn't want to. He'd rather just wait for me to come home. That's oddly sweet. I know. Ugh, I love him so much sometimes it's gross. Are you sure you're going to be okay if I leave? Yes. Yeah. Okay. I love you. - I love you. And fuck this bar. It's stupid. - Yeah, fuck it. - Yeah. Go. - Alright, what do I owe ya? - Oh, it's on me, no. It's the least I could do for being such a lovely company. You really don't have to do that. Well, I know one way you can repay me. Looks like I'm not working New Year's Eve. So, how about you and I ring in the New Year together? Oh, Mas, I'm... I'm r-really sorry, but I don't think so. I mean, you're really charming, and I've had a lot of fun with you. But if I'm being honest, I need someone who's a little more... God, I hate I'm saying this... But serious. More serious. Oh. Oh, oh. I... I-I can... No, I can... I can be serious. I can be serious. Um... Hmm, I at least want to try. I know, but I can't be someone's trial. I need someone who knows. You know? Yeah, I get it. I get it. Thanks for understanding. I really am sorry. Look, man, I just got an email from Uniformity. "Finally connected with Allen. Sorry we couldn't work it out. Best of luck to you both." Milan, I'm sorry I didn't tell you. When did this happen? Between which challenge where I was helping you did you send this email? Hang on. Let's just talk about this, man. This... this is beyond shitty, man. They reached out to me, Allen. Let's not forget this is my company. Right, right, yeah. I'm just the upbeat sidekick, right? You don't want to take me seriously? Definitely, you don't want to treat me like an actual fucking business partner. It's not like that, man. It's just lately you've been kind of... What? I'm what, Allen? Well, it's like you've been treating the business like it's some kind of Instagram, Pinterest, click baity thing. And it's not... it's not an app. We sell furniture. Right, right. Well, you know what? I'm out, man. But hey, congrats, though. You got what you wanted. It's all you now, man. Best of luck. Milan. Milan! Are you serious?! Hey. Hey. Are you... Sorry. It's not my business anymore, and this isn't my bar anymore, so... You guys are the best. I'm still pissed about the darts. Okay. You said you beat me. And if that's true, then technically we're tied, and I can't live with that doubt. What are you saying? Autumn, can I get a ruling on this? Shouldn't the winner have to win by two? Oh, yeah, yeah, yes. Win by two. Mm-hmm, yes. Because that will make me feel a lot better. Um, maybe just like a simple game like rock, paper, scissors? Does that work? Oh, totally. That's how we do it in Tampa. You know, so if... if Adam wins this challenge, then, well, you know, game over. But if Nina wins, whoo, we got to go into overtime. Unless, you know, you don't want to and you want to admit that I did beat you in darts and that you were wrong and lied. Because then I'd be fine. How many throws? One, on three. Ooh! Boom, overtime, baby! - What's... what's happening? - Hey. - What's happening? - Hey. Hey, Dick. Try this new Manhattan recipe I've been toying with. - A new one? - Mm-hmm. Oh, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no. I got my orders to do tomorrow still. Oh, no, no, no. You relax. Relax, bud. I'll help take care of those orders. - You gonna help me? - I'm going to help you. - You'll help me? - I promise. I'll meet you there? I'll be right there. Excuse me. I'm going first this time.

I don't mean to interrupt. I just... the back door was opened, and I heard someone, so I just... What are you doing here? Oh, well, that's kind of hard to explain. So I got stuck helping a friend in an emergency. That's why I wasn't able to meet earlier. I tried messaging you after, but you weren't answering. And I saw that on the app, you hadn't left this location and it was super late, so I came to make sure you're okay. - The app? - Yeah. Uh, this stupid dating app has a location function. Any normal person would think that you left your cellphone at the bar, but I have three sisters. And I know. I can hear how crazy the sounds now coming out of my mouth. No, it's okay. It's sweet, actually, but as you can see, I'm fine. And then some. Right, I'll leave you to whatever you're doing. I saw nothing. No, it's okay. You know, actually, if I didn't creep you out too much, I'd still love to buy you a drink. Regular business hours, of course. No. Yeah. I'll message you. Awesome. Okay. Well, have a nice night. It's nice meeting you all. Kind of. I'm going to go. Bye. Bye, bye. That was clearly interference. Get a mulligan. Aah! How is that thing so heavy? Oh, my God. Are you okay? It's fine. Looks like the flat end just landed on him. Alright, alright, let's, um, give him a hand. Come on. - Aah. It's gonna be alright. Easy, easy. Okay, okay. Just gonna get this off. No, it's just bruised. Um, do you guys have any, uh... Yeah, that. Thank you. Okay. It was Chelsea's idea. You don't need to explain. It's okay. I was just so mad. And you...

Wow. Dick, orders are done. I love you so hard. So, what? You managing now? Just helping out a little bit. Figure it's a good way to start taking myself a little bit more seriously. Yeah, well, you fuck with my shifts and you dead. Anyway, Nina and Allen, huh? Hmm. You think there'd be a better way to figure out your issues. - Right. - Ever heard of therapy?

Dick, what do we say about saying daddy? Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry, it slipped out as I was offering to buy you your breakfast. What about the happy couple? - Hell, yeah. - Nah, we're okay. Oh, uh, I thought we were going to my place. Oh, come on. Don't be lame. You guys know Allen. Once he gets an idea in his head, there's no changing it. - Right, right, right. Fine, yeah, let's go. I guess it's better if I change my mind on a whim like a windsock. Okay, that's insulting. You just called me lame. I was joking. Geez, I'm sorry. I'm just going with the flow. Relax. When in history has telling somebody to relax ever actually made them relax? Says the guy who tried to tell me to calm down earlier tonight. I didn't actually say it though, did I? Guys, guys, we can just do something else. It's breakfast, Allen. If you don't want to hang out, just say that. You always do this, try to goad me by insulting me. I always do this. We didn't etch our plans in fucking stone, Allen. So you admit we talked about it. Sure, we talked about it. Yippee. But then our friends invited us to do something fun. Can't you give an inch? Can't you, for once in your life, be open to suggestion? I'm not closed off to suggestion. I try new things. - Just not for me. Well, there is a breaking point. Not everything needs updating or a Nina-once-over. A Nina-once-over? You're never happy. There's always a better way with you. That's rich. If there's any deviation from what you planned, it's like the world ended. I just watched you torch a friendship and business partnership tonight because you wouldn't let go of control. That's why we broke up, Allen. Because you refused to grow. Hold on. That's not fair. I created a business from nothing, and I cultivated it and took care of it. There comes a time when you have to accept the thing for what it is. Can't tweak it forever, or else... it won't be the thing you built. That's such a twisted way... You're trying to say that I haven't evolved or whatever, but really I've just accepted myself for who I am. And you don't like it, so you broke up with me because I'm not good enough for you anymore. That's not true. I grew up, and I wanted to try and see new things with you. But what I wanted didn't matter anymore. Why didn't you bring up the bar when we broke up? I don't know. I guess I knew it would upset you. Why didn't you bring it up? Maybe just reminded me of when things were good between us. Look, I... I want to be with someone who accepts me for who I am. And I need someone who's willing to grow with me. Where does that leave us? Do I have to be the one to say it? Say what? That we just don't care enough about each other to compromise. Police. Nobody move. Oh, fuck! The city has pretty clear rules on after hours consumption, Mr. Tishwany. Okay, we're going to need everyone to step... Raymond? Thought I recognized you. Elena, from... Can I talk to you? Sure, yeah. Sure. 10-4, over. We have a bar fight. It's under control. Let's go. So, Elena... So, Mason? You want to tell us what just went down? No. So, Elena, may I ask how do you know him? AA. Well, thank goodness for you. What is so fucking funny? You realize we nearly got shut down, yeah? I get that it's no fun working when other people are having fun, but work isn't to supposed to be fun. It's supposed to be work. It's not supposed to be fun. Honestly, I should fire you all. I should... I should fire myself. I should fire myself. No more fucking around. You got it? Autumn, if you want, you can start full time tonight. Oh. Thank you. Welcome to the fam, Autumn. Actually, don't. Call me Florida. I like representing. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes, yes, yes. I know we didn't figure out who gets to stay, so I'll make it easy. You're both 86ed. Okay? But also you're adults. Why are you making us decide for you? Grow up. Whatever. I'm still hammered. What are you guys doing hanging around? Clean this place up. Good luck you two. - Well, I'm... - I guess we should... I'm sorry. Go ahead. - I'm that way. - Yeah, I'm... Want me to walk you? Sexist. What I sat in there, I didn't mean... You did. So did I. I just wish it didn't come out that way. I was... Anyway, I'm... I'm sorry about that. Me, too. But also I'm not sorry. Me, too. Goodbye, Allen.
