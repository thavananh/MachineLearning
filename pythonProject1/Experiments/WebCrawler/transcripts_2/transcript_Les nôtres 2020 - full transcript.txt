It's no small feat selling chocolate door-to-door and trying to convince the business owners, even the tougher ones. You all know who I'm talking about, right? In any case, you succeeded. We picked ourselves up, licked our wounds, and five years later, we're stronger than ever. Thanks to each and every one of you, we'll have a beautiful place to come together. And above all, a wonderful park for our children. We recognize good leaders by their strength in difficult times. Jean-Marc, I think everyone here agrees you're an exemplary mayor. Brave and kind. You are truly a pillar of our community. And on a more personal note... I don't know what I would have done without you these past five years. We owe you a lot. So please join me in welcoming to the stage our mayor, Jean-Marc Ricard. Thank you so much, Isabelle, for your kind words. Good evening to you all. I think we can all recall where we were that tragic night. My wife Chantale and I were at home celebrating Valentine's Day. It's been almost five years now. When you're the mayor of a small town, a small and quiet town, you don't expect to that to handle anything like this. When I got to the factory, I knew there were people trapped under the rubble. All I wanted was to get them out alive. Isabelle, I'm going to have to live with this... The fact that I was helpless to save your husband, my friend, Martin... and all the others. But you know... Tonight is a night of celebration, it's a party, in honor of our lost loved ones. And above all, for the future of our children, tonight we finally unveil the Saint-Germain Park! Here it is! Don't just sit there everybody, come take a look. -What's so funny? Hey Michel! Michel, I want to get a photo. Manu, where's your brother? -Right there. -Felipe! Time for a picture. Mag, why don't you join us? -Here? -Yes, it's perfect. Hey, it's out first official family photo! -It sure is! -Pull your hair back, I want to see your face. Stand up straight. Dad would've enjoyed tonight, huh? -Good call! -Woo-hoo! -Cool color, huh? -It's OK... -Well, I like it. What do you mean he has a crush on her? -On Élisa? -Yeah. Well I don't know, Manu told me-- No, it was Vincent who told Manu that he's noticed Élisa like, a while ago. So I figured I'd go and find out. But then Manu came and stopped me, so I think he's already made up his mind to... you know. So anyway... -You're cute. -Makeover time. Start with lipstick. It'll be super-hot. Let's go guys! Let's go dance! -Bye, honey. -Bye. You didn't open your curtain last night... Made me feel sad, my princess. -Seven, eight! Yeah! Mag, snap out of it! Magalie? Mag, are you OK? -All good. You're doing fine, dear. OK. Now we need to do a blood test. Is this your first time? It's just a little sting. It won't hurt much. If it turns out to be a fracture, the doctor will see it in the scan. -Are you Magalie Jodoin's mother? -Yes, I am... Is she OK? Hey... Look at me. I don't understand... -I'm sorry... -Magalie... We need to discuss your medical follow up. -Dr Guérin, can you give us a moment? -Well, you see... It's not noticeable, but Magalie is quite far along in her pregnancy. -What do you mean? -We need to do an ultrasound to determine the stage of fetal development. I'm not sure how you managed to keep this to yourself, but I suspect you're already in your second trimester. -I can't believe it... -Magalie... My name is Patrice. I'm a social worker. I'm here so we can try to understand what happened, together. OK? Your baby has a dad, right? Can you tell us his name? -Mommy... -It's OK, sweetheart, I'm here. -I know this is hard for you, but we're going to have to talk about it, OK? -Did someone hurt you? -No, it's not that. -So, what is it, Magalie? Can you tell us what happened? -Mr. Champagne... May I speak to you in private? -Yeah, sure. -I'll be back. What are you, the police? Calm down! -I'm just looking out for her best interests. -I assure you, Mr. Champagne, I've spent the last 13 years doing just that. -I'm going to bed. -Not so fast, young lady, we're not done yet. -Everything alright? -We'll talk tomorrow. -OK. Well, your son was very well-behaved. -Thanks. -Bye, honey-bun. Take it easy. [Are you OK?] -...I asked her for some nude pics... -Hey, Mag! What happened to you? -I busted my arm. -Do you have to quit dance? -No, I just have to be careful. -Did Taz take care of you? -No, I haven't seen him yet. -When do we get to meet him? -Yeah? -Uh, I don't know. He's always in Montreal for his university, so... -Are you afraid we'll steal him? It's just a joke. You can keep your precious Taz. -Over there! -Manu! Manu! -Quit acting like a star, you fucking ape. Good job guys! -Good game, good game. Bye! -Samuel, go get your sister please! -I don't feel like it. She's probably at the old beach with Manu. They're so gross. -You really shouldn't have hit him. It wasn't worth the penalty. -I tripped him! -It still wasn't worth the yellow card. -It was a red card. -Right, even worse. -Hey, you guys wanna go to the movies tonight? -Where? There's only one movie theater... -We saw the new posters on Thursday. -Oh, yeah! -You can all come to my place afterwards. -Magalie! -Magalie! Manu! -What? -You're coming home with me right now. -What's going on? -You're coming home. -OK, calm down! -Excuse me? You don't get to tell me to calm down! Let's go! Isa... Isa, it doesn't mean anything... -It's fine. -Magalie has a cast? -Shotgun on the Wii! Come play! -Is she going to be OK? I hope it won't get in the way of her dancing. She's something else! She really lets loose! What a sight, and at that age... -Mom looks mad. Bet it's your fault again. -Maybe it's because you keep peeing your bed? -Let go of me! Stop! -Sam! -It's not my fault! -Go to your room right now. Right now! Is it him? -What are you talking about? -If it's that little Mexican... I'll have him sent right back to Child Protective Services. -What the hell, mom, it's not even him! -Well, who is it then? Who is it, Magalie? Who is it? -I don't know, OK? -There's been more than one? -No mom, that's not it. -Well, what is it? What are you hiding from me, Magalie? -Nothing. -What are you hiding from me? -I saw you made some new friends on the team. -Mm-hm. -I told you you'd fit right in. People are friendly here. Like Magalie... You guys seemed pretty close earlier. Is she your girlfriend? -No. -So you don't have a girlfriend? -It's none of your business. -Honey, I just want to talk. Magalie's pretty-- -Stop it. -If there's something going on between you two-- -There's nothing, I told you. -You sure? -She just wants to be friends, OK? -OK. -Sam! Bring down your laundry please. -Yeah, sure, maybe... Alright, Chantale, thanks for calling. Bye. Magalie! Come up and eat something. -Hi! -Hi. How I missed that beautiful face of yours. How are you, my princess? Does your arm still hurt? -A little, but it's fine. -OK. Hey. Stand up and show me how beautiful you are today. -Notice anything different? -No... -I'm gonna have a baby. -You're gonna have a baby? That's some pretty big news, huh? Let's not tell anyone, OK? It'll be our little secret. -OK. -Don't worry, my princess. We'll find a solution. -Yeah, OK. -I have to go... -Well, bye. -Bye. -Mom! What the hell! -Who is Taz? -What are you talking about? -Who's Taz? -Give that back. You have no right. -Answer me! -Give it back, mom! -Who's texting you all these hearts? -Mom, give it! [$20 for a hand job?] -Finally. -Old nag... I didn't mean to scream like that earlier. I'm sorry. But I don't want any more secrets between us, OK? -Anyway, I'd hate to be in Isabelle's shoes right now. -Does she know who the father is? -She thought it was Manu. -Come on... Are they even that close? -Well, yeah. -Did you ask him? -Yeah, we had a talk yesterday. -And? -He got a little defensive, but... Nothing happened between them. -Are you sure? -Yes, I know him. -But that's just it. We don't really know them. They've only been with us for two years. -No... I would've felt it if he'd been lying to me. -You'd only know if you'd given birth to them. You're probably right. -Mag, I have to tell you something. Remember the guy who-- You OK? -Yeah... It's just that he's not answering my texts. -Taz? -Yeah. -Well then dump his ass. You never see him anyway. -He's super busy. -You're always chasing him, Mag. Wake up! He's playing you! -Why don't you get yourself a boyfriend and leave me alone, you jealous bitch! -I thought you were with your brother. Where is he? -I don't know. At the campground, maybe? -Was he alone? -No. -Who was he with? Magalie? -I don't know. -I have to go back to the office. Go home and get yourself a brownie. -Yes! -See you soon! -Magalie, there's someone here to see you. Magalie, there's someone here to see you. -Hi Magalie. -What's he doing here? -We need to talk, and Mr. Champagne-- -Your mom thinks you might need to talk to someone. And maybe I could be-- -I don't need to talk to anybody. Leave me alone! -Magalie, get back here. Open the door! Magalie, you can't ignore me for the rest of your life! Unlock this door right now. Magalie, open the door! Open it! -I wish you were the one who died! -May I? Magalie? -Go away. -I just want to chat. My girlfriend and I were 15. We used protection and everything, but... she got pregnant anyway. She wanted to keep it, so I said... OK. So I know what it's like to have to grow up too fast. But we had each other. -Go away. I don't wanna talk to you. -Magalie, I'm not here for your mom, I'm here for you. I know what you're going through. It doesn't have to be so difficult. There could be a happy ending to this. But you need to let me help you. -Have you told the father? Magalie, you can't keep avoiding this. Who's Taz? Are you afraid he'll get in trouble? -It's my baby. I don't need anyone. -Magalie... Mag? Don't forget to pick up your brother from school, OK? -OK. -OK. I... Have a good day, sweetheart. I love you. -The nurse who did her blood work is a friend of mine. She said the kid wasn't too proud of herself. No wonder Isabelle can't focus. -She almost cost our public funding. What's next? She'll forget to send the grant application all together? And she'll be dealing with a baby soon... -I'll talk to her. -You can skip the jumps, sweetie. No big deal. You won't be able to compete anyway. Keep going! -OK! Next week, we'll work on the ending. That's enough, no whining. One of us has a broken arm and is still working hard. Have a good week, ladies! -Bye! -That broken arm is the least of your problems, huh? -Mag! Magalie, wait up! -Leave me alone, Manuel. -What did I do? Magalie! -I said leave me alone! -What's wrong? -What the fuck, Mag... You should quit fucking taco heads and get it on with some real guys. -Shut up! What do you know about fucking? -And Einstein here forgot to wear a rubber. -Back off, dumbass! You don't have a fucking clue! You're just a piece of shit! -And you're a dirty whore. Must've really wanted it bad to get knocked up by a spic. -Shut up! -Break his face! -Are you OK, sweetie? -Mm-hm. Can we not talk about it tonight? -OK. OK. -Hi my love. -Hi. -Did you have a nice day? -Mm-hm. ♪I had the strangest dream♪ ♪Where it was just the two of us♪ ♪Carefree and reclusive♪ ♪Our bodies nearly nude♪ ♪Muffled by the shining light♪ ♪In our eyes were shards of glass♪ ♪And so we stayed♪ ♪And so we stayed♪ ♪I had the strangest dream♪ ♪Where it was just the two of us♪ ♪Haloed in happiness♪ ♪Under hundreds of tearful suns♪ ♪Skin held together by string♪ ♪Emerging from our Achilles' heels♪ ♪And so we stayed♪ [Whore] [Fucking slut] [Change schools already] -Who's the best player in Sainte-Adeline? -Manu Flores! Manu! Manu! [We need to talk...] Yes, Karine? -It's OK, it's no rush. -No, no...what can I do for you? -Can you sign the addendum? It's for the water main repairs. -Of course. Thank you so much. -Thanks. -Karine. Tell your dad to give me a call. I might have some good news about his permit. -Great. -Good job! Bring it home! Come on! Goal's over there! If you can't play, get back on the bench! OK, come on, boys! Defense! -What the hell are you waiting for? Just send him the fuck home! -Well don't send him to my place. My daughter's home alone! -What? Can't you control your little girl? -It's not her I'm worried about, man. -So, how is Julie's macaroni? -Good! -I was thinking it's been ages since we did something fun together. -We could go on the rides at the fair. Say yes... -Mm, I think they're closed. But I thought we could go to Quebec City for the weekend. Hm? And we could go shopping. -Shopping? Gross! -They have arcades there too. -Can I go to the bathroom? -Yes. -Thanks. -I did some research... And there's a specialized clinic where they... they take patients over 20 weeks in. So I asked, and they're willing to-- -Stop it. I won't go. -Couldn't you talk to Patrice about it? You two get along, right? -Mom, I don't want anything. -Magalie, I know it's not easy... But you need to open up a-- -Are you deaf? I don't need anything. -What happened, sweetie? Please talk to me! My baby, what's going on in your head? Look at me when I'm talking to you! Look at me! -You'd never understand. -What do you mean? I'm your mother! Talk to me! -Back off! -Who do you think will be raising this baby? Did you ever think about that? You even think about that? I'm on my own! -I will! -Magalie, you're 13 years old. 13! There's also adoption-- -No, stop! It's my body and it's my baby! You don't have the right to say that! You don't own me! -Mm. -Should I be worried? -What if they're right? About Mag and Manu? What if it's true? It'd be our fault. Oh my God. -Do you really believe what you're saying? -I don't know. Magalie is Manu's best friend. I don't know what to think anymore. I'm tired. -Magalie! Sam! Hurry up, we're leaving in 15 minutes! Thank you. -Good morning. -For fuck's sake... -I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. -It's OK. No, Jean-Marc, please don't. -Let me. Kids! -I'm coming! -Me too! -Are you alright? -Listen, Jean-Marc... I don't know how to say this, but... You've given me such a great opportunity with the memorial park, but with all that's been happening, I know I haven't delivered. I'm sorry. -Hey, stop that. You know I'm here for you. If it helps, Mag's school is on my way to work. One less thing for you to do... Hello. -Hi. -Watch it, there's broken glass. Magalie! Now I'm really going to be late, so hurry up. Magalie, Jean-Marc has kindly offered to drop you off at school. -It's on the way. -And you're coming with me. -But mom! I wanted pancakes! -You should've thought of that sooner. I'm making us toast, and then we're out of here. That's enough. Hurry up. You too, Magalie. Thanks. -It's no bother. I'm sorry I haven't been around much. The situation is a little complicated, you know? How are you feeling? -Fine. -Have you decided what to do? -I'm keeping it. -That's too bad. Everything could've gone back to the way it was. You're still my little princess. You know that, right? Do you want me to keep taking care of you? And for me to keep doing that... you can't share our secret... with anyone. Do you remember our agreement? I take care of you. I'm there for you, for your family. Tell me you'll keep our secret. -Yes. -People wouldn't believe you anyway. And... you liked it too, remember? It would be a shame to ruin everything. I've always trusted you. And I don't want this to end. But sometimes, I wonder about you. You and Manu are pretty close, huh? A little too close, I'd say. If you want things to be like before... I need to know you're mine alone. ♪tense music♪ -Watch it, cunt. -Come on guys, the bell rang, so sit down. Now, please. Who can tell me the source of this quote? No one? It will be on the exam tomorrow. Camille? No? OK, go to page 75 of your textbooks, and let's find out. The person who said this lovely phrase was Joseph Goebbels. He was the Minister of Propaganda under the Third Reich. -Check your phone. -So I'd like you to read the paragraph at the bottom of the page. And we'll discuss it after. [Long Live Miss Slut!] [How much do you charge?] [You make me wanna puke.] -Léa, silence please. Review your notes if you forgot your textbook. -Hello Manuel. I know there's a lot of us here. We came to ask you about the night of the fundraiser. You remember, right? Last winter? But first, I need to ask you... Do you consent to having Chantale and Jean-Marc stay in the room while we talk? -It's OK, no one's going to hurt you. -Chantale, come sit down. -This is Patrice, Magalie's social worker. -Hello. Manuel, did anything out of the ordinary happen between you and Magalie? -Don't you want to sit down? -At school, they said you put something in her drink. -Manuel, Magalie told us everything. -Sweetie, you can't eat before your blood test tomorrow. Don't forget. -I don't want to go back there! Let's go. -What are you doing here? -I wanna talk. -Magalie, I'm married. You know that. -Magalie, you didn't get changed? -Hi everybody! Happy birthday, Samuel. -Hi Jean-Marc. -How are you? -Good, thanks. Hi Chantale! -Hi there. -My God, you shouldn't have! -It's the least I could do. -I'm happy to see you. -Me too. -What happened here? -Oh... -How about a beer? -Yes, sir. -I'm so sorry. -Oh it's nothing. Don't worry about it. -Glass of wine? -Yes, red, please. -I brought this back inside. -Thanks. -It must not have been easy, what you did. -No... -I have a cousin who adopted some little Haitians. It didn't end well either. You know as well as me, Sainte-Adeline is a tight-knit community. This nonsense is just not us. -Wait, sweetheart. It's not time for cake yet. -Hey, great party. -Thanks. -Sam must be please. -He really is. He says it's the best day of his life. -Really? -He never wants it to end. -That's great! Look what I found... It's from when we first started dating. Remember the Lavoie's party? We played volleyball. You picked me to be on your team. -It's been so long I almost forgot about it. -We beat them all. And to celebrate, you gave me my first taste of gin. We talked all night... until my parents came to pick me up. I'm still that girl. It's OK, my love, take your time. Yes... -Sam, go inside the house please. -Hello. -What can I do for you? -Well, I wanted to make sure everything was going well. -Sam, go inside. Yes, everything's fine, thank you. -Hi, Magalie. I just had a long conversation with Manuel. He had a lot to say. And some of it's not adding up. -How's he doing? -Fine, under the circumstances. So, do you want to talk about it? -Sweetie, you don't have to answer. Go on inside. -We just want things to go back to normal. You understand that, right? -Yes I do, but Magalie's story has a few inconsistencies. -Magalie! -Ah! [Sainte-Adeline remembers] Ah! -Don't stay there, come with me. You can talk to me. I won't judge you. -I don't want this fucking baby anymore... -Sometimes, we do things that have serious consequences. Right? You didn't see this coming, did you? Manu isn't the father, is he? Leave... -Still no news? Yes, OK, thank you. -Magalie! We've been driving around town all morning! Let's go back, alright? We're going to look after you and your baby. Magalie, wait! -Don't you dare touch me! -Just listen to me. -What do you want? -I only want what's best for you, my princess. -No, this is all your fault! -It's nobody's fault. We fell in love. -No! Stop! -What is it? You're afraid of me? Is that it? -Let go of me! -You will do as I say. Is that clear? Stay here. -Hi! -Hi Simon. I found her. -We knew she couldn't have gone far. They always turn up in the area. Mr. Mayor... -Teenagers, right? They need to feel free. But she doesn't realize everyone's worried about her. -Yeah. Well, you gave us quite the scare, dear. Are you going to be OK? -I just wanna go home. -OK. Come with me, honey. -Managing all these construction sites can't be easy for you, Isabelle. -It's a lot of work, but I can't complain. -She's really efficient! -She's so good at what she does. -Hi Magalie! -Back already, sweetie? -Do you want him back? -No, it's fine. -What are you doing? -I forgot my charger. -You're going back out? Come on, Magalie! Won't you have dessert with us? -No, my friends are waiting in the car. Mom... I'm staying over at Kayla's, don't worry about me. -OK. -It'll be OK, mom. -Isabelle? Isabelle? Do you have any more napkins? -Yes, just a second.
