Tell me, please. Tell me, please. Tell me. Tell me. Come on. You'll be all right. - Where am I? - This... This is my truck. It's OK. - No, where...? - You're OK. I drive you home from the church. You rest. I'm sorry I couldn't take you home in a taxicab. But I'm a bachelor with three dependents, I can't afford no cab fare. And you didn't have a purse with you. Oh, yeah. Where is my purse? - Did you have a purse with you? - I think so. I don't know. You want to go back and get it? - We'll look for it? - No, no, no. - You sure? - I want to go home, please. That's almost where you are now. When somebody else is crying I gotta cry too. I'm sympathetic. I got too much of a heart. Don't cry. Why should you cry? I know. It ain't like a man. Oh, a man sometimes has to cry like anyone else. You're very understanding. Sometimes a man has to cry the same as a woman. A man is not so different from anyone else. - Take it. - Oh, grazie. You stop that, then I'll stop too, huh? No, you stop first, and I'll stop. No, you first. Ladies first, you know? Ladies first. I stop. OK? OK, me too. I stop, see? Your shirt is torn, huh? Oh, yes, Mrs. Delle Rose. You tore it when I pulled you away from the priest. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I'll sew it for you. - Oh, that's nothing. It's nothing. - Forget it. - I'll sew it for you. Come on. I'm ready to laugh now. Oh, my. I'm sorry you lost your pocketbook, you know? How much money you got in the pocketbook? Much? Don't worry about it. Let me worry about it. Give me your shirt. And, please, will you open the shutters for me? - I can't see. - Oh, sure. Sure. A little bit. What, lady? The light on the body was like a man that lived here. - What? - Oh, my. Ma che strano. Your people, they come from Naples? - No, no. Sicily. - Sicily! Well, what's the matter? - Nothing. Nothing. - Che c'e? Nothing. Nothing. You got a bathroom in your house? - You got a bathroom in your house? - Of course we have a bathroom. - We don't have one at our house. - No? And I would like to wash up, because I think maybe I smell like a goat, you know? - Oh, please. Help yourself. - Grazie. - This way. - Con permesso. Prego. Oh, Madonna Santa. Madonna Santa, my husband's body with a head of a clown. A clown that smells like a goat. Oh, Lady. Lady, speak to me. Is it the sign, this? Oh, please. - Ciao! - Oh, ciao. You startled me. I washed up. I feel better. You feel better too? Yeah, much better, thank you. Now I cried, and I feel much better. That's good. Yeah, and now I can't get up. - You mean you can't get down. - I mean... Yeah, I can't get down. What's that you got in your hand? A bottle of vino? - What? - Vino. Is that vino? Yeah, Spumanti it is. Yeah. It comes from the house of the family of my husband. A very great family, you know. The Delle Rose. Barons. - Barons? - Yes. I... I was a peasant, but I married a baron. I married a baron when I didn't have shoes. Oh, shoes. What shoes? You had three very sweet things. Heart, face and figure. And even a baron's human. - You know, like a truck driver. - Yeah. - I sew the shirt now for you, huh? - OK. I'm a very frank person. I'll tell you something. My old-maid sister, she wanted us to meet each other. - Yeah? Why? - Well, she says, "This very nice lady, this widow, this baronessa, "she's lonely and you're lonely. Why don't you get acquainted?" She wanted us to meet each other before this time, you know? - Really? - Yeah, really. I'm a frank person, too, and I'll tell you something now. You can tell your sister I don't need to meet nobody, because my husband is with me. We are not separated. I turn around, and I see my husband here with me in this... Bottle? Bottle. Urn. Marble urn. Come here. You see, the ashes of the rose that I keep in my heart. I'm sorry, I... No, it's nothing. The priest was against it. It broke the laws of the church. I know. But I had... I had to have something. And this was all I could have. I think God has forgiven. What makes you think that God has forgiven? - I know him. - You know him? I know him. He has forgiven. You'll see. Nobody knows how lonely someone can be. There's nothing wrong with it. The body would've decayed, but the ashes always stay clean, you know? Gentle. You see, this is our wedding picture. Hey. Che bell'uomo. Yeah, a rose of a man, my husband. A rose, a rose. On his chest he had a rose tattoo, you know? - A rose tattoo? - Yeah. - No. - A rose tattoo. - Let me see. - Oh. "Let me see." - "Let me see." - Yeah, right. Do you believe strange things? I would like to tell you something, but I got to speak frankly, you know? Speak frankly. We're both grown-up adult people. Yeah. You know, my husband, he had this rose tattoo on his chest. One night I woke up with a burning pain on me here. I turned on the light in the bedroom, and I looked in the mirror. On my breast, I saw the rose tattoo of my husband. On me here, his tattoo. - Strano. - Yeah. And this was the night that... - Yeah, but I got to speak frankly. - Speak frankly. Come on. That was the night that I got my son. The little boy that I lost when I lost Rosario. - When I lost my husband. - Strano. Ah, si. Che davvero. Would you be willing to show me the rose tattoo? - What? - Well... It's gone now. Oh, please. It only lasted a moment, but I saw it so clearly. So clearly, I saw it. - You believe me? - Si, si. Lo credo. Maybe it could be back, no? I don't know why I told you, you know? - Well, I just... - Only because I liked what you say. That bodies decay, but the ashes always stay clean. Immacolato. But there are some people... Oh, there are some people, they want to make everything dirty. Everything dirty, believe me. Two of them kind of people come in the house today and told me a terrible lie... about my husband. So terrible a lie that if I thought it was true, you know, I would smash it. Smash the urn, like... - Like this! - No, no, lady. - Not the wine. - Oh, no. - Not the wine. - Not the wine. No, don't be afraid. Not the wine. Not the wine. - Will you open the wine for me? - Sure, sure. - Thank you. Oh, my head. - What...? Well, what kind of a lie did they tell you? No, no, no. I don't want to talk about it. I don't believe the lie. I don't believe the lie. The memory of the rose in my heart is perfect. Oh, I like a lady that laughs with all her heart. And a lady that cries with her heart? I like everything a lady does with her heart. - Look at your face! - I know! - Here. - What's happening? Hey, you kids! Get off of that truck! Keep your paws off of them bananas! Oh, I forgot. - You haul bananas? - Si, signora. I was supposed to get my truck into Biloxi an hour, two hours ago. It's a five-ton truck? - A three-ton truck. - Three? My husband hauled bananas in a five-ton truck. - Well, he was a baron. - He was... - Yeah. Did you haul just bananas? - Just bananas. What else? My husband hauled bananas, but underneath the bananas was something else, you know. Oh, he was wild like a Gypsy. He was wild like a Gypsy. Where did I hear that before? He was wild like a Gyp... I hate to start to remember, you know? And then not to remember, you know? I better call my boss in Biloxi, explain how come I'm so late. - It's a long-distance call? - Don't worry about it. No, no, please. I don't worry about it. You will pay. - Hello, operator? - Umber, please. Get me the Southern Fruit Company in Biloxi, 2-4-6-8-1. That's right. - Yes, sir. - Oh, my number is 6-6-9-9. That's right. You know, you got a nice, cozy little home-like place here. Yeah. How is the place where you live in? I got a place with three dependents in it. The line is busy. - Prego. - Hey, grazie. What dependents? - Is good Spumanti. - This is good. Well, there's... There's the one old-maid sister, one feeble-minded grandmother and one lush of a pop who ain't worth the powder it takes to blow him to... Scusatemi. You know, they got the Parchesi habit. - Yeah? - They play the game of Parchesi morning, night and noon. And they pass the cans of beer around the table. They got the beer habit too? And the numbers habit. You know, this spring my old-maid sister, she gets some kind of lady trouble. Mostly mental, I think. And she turns the housekeeping over to the feeble-minded grandmother, who's a very sweet old lady, but who don't think it's necessary to pay the grocery bills as long as she's got money to play the numbers. She plays the numbers. She's got a perfect system, but it don't ever work. And the grocery bills go up, up, up so high you can't see them. - I better try my boss again. - Yeah. I'll tell you my hopes and dreams. - Who, me? - Operator. The number, please. Oh, excuse me. Hello, operator? The Southern Fruit Company in Biloxi, 2-4-6-8-1. - That's right. - May I have your number? My number is 6-6-9-9. - 6-6-9-9, that's right. - Yes, sir. I'm hoping to meet some sensible older lady, you know? I don't care if she's a little bit too plump or not such a stylish dresser. The important thing in a lady is understanding. - Good sense, you know? - Yeah. And I want her to have a nice, well-furnished house and a profitable little business of some kind. I see. And... ...such a lady, with a well-furnished house and business, what does she want with a man with three dependents and the Parchesi and the beer habit, plays the numbers? Oh, my! Love and affection in a world that... That's lonely and cold. Yeah, it might be lonely, but I would not say cold on this particular day. Love and affection is what I got to offer on hot or cold days in this lonely old world. I got nothing else. - Mangiacavallo has nothing. - Who? - Me! Alvaro Mangiacavallo. - Oh, yeah. You know, Mangiacavallo means "eat a horse". You know this. But I don't have a horse to eat, not even a chicken. I'm the grandson of the village idiot of Riveri. - Oh, I see you like to make jokes now. - No, no. No joke. Davvero! He chased my grandmother in a flooded rice field. She slipped on a wet rock: Ecco, here I am. Oh, please. You should be more respectful, you know? What have I got to respect? The rock my grandmother slips on? Yourself at least. You don't work for a living? Hey, if I don't work for a living I would respect myself more. - Yeah? - Baronessa, I'm a healthy young man. Hey, I exist without no genuine love life. I look at them pictures in the magazines... Them girls in the advertisements, you know what I mean. They got a little bitty thing here, a little bitty thing there. That's all they need, they're so skinny! Yeah. It's a long-distance call, you know. Is the line busy? - Not the line, the boss. - The boss. Get your boss on the phone or hang up. - OK, OK. - Hello. Pilade talking. Oh, hello! Oh, hello, Mr. Pilade! How's things at the Southern Fruit Company this hot afternoon? Yeah, Mangiacavallo! - I got a complaint about you. - What? Well, what complaint? - What happened? - I tell you. Over three hours ago, Joe passed the church and seen your truck parked with the bananas and you playing bingo. Ow, you get them bananas here. You're fired, you hear? - What? - Drive your truck for somebody else. Mr. Pilade! Well, wait a minute, Mr... - What's happened? - What's happened? A man with three dependents out of a job. And my truck ain't even paid for. I can't see no more. I got a suggestion to make you, huh? Open that drawer, and you will find a package with a shirt in it. - This one? - You can wear it and call for this one later. - There's a name on it. - No, don't tell me the name, please. Throw it away. Out the window. Ecco fatto. Seta! Seta puro! Oh, this shirt's too good for Mangiacavallo. Everything here is too good for Mangiacavallo. Nothing's too good for a man, if the man's good. Put it on. You are welcome to it. - Bella? - Oh, bella. - Can I...? - Sicuramenti. Prego. - How does it feel, the silk on you? - Just feels like a girl's hands on me. It will make you less trouble, believe me. You know, there's nothing more beautiful than a gift between people. - No? - Yeah. You like me a little better now, huh? You know what they should have done when you was a baby? - What? - They should have put tape on your ears... to hold them back. Like this. Lookit. Is not much better, huh? So when you grow up, they wouldn't stick out like the wings of a little kewpie. Lady, lady! The black goat is loose again! II becco della strega. Look at my tomatoes. Look at my...! Oh, the strega. She has a demon eye, you know. Now, don't get excited. Don't worry. I will catch the black goat, and I'll give him a kick he'll never forget. Come on! Come on! I got a friendship with goats. Come on! It was nothing. Oh, no. Please. Look. Oh, my. In here. Yeah. - OK. - You're troppo gentile, signora. Delle Rose. Signora Delle Rose. I have to go now. I know, I know. Please. Please. Wonderful. Oh, wonderful! Excuse the way I'm not dressed. I'm not always like this, no. Sometimes I fix myself up, yeah. When my husband was living, when my husband comes home... When he was living, I had a clean dress on, you know? And sometimes even... Even I put a rose in my hair. A rose in your hair would be pretty. Oh, yeah, but not for a widow. It's not the time of roses. Why? You make a mistake. It's always for everybody the time of the roses. - Yeah? - The rose is... The rose is the heart of the world like the... Like the heart is the heart of the body. How's that? Good, eh? But you, baronessa, you know what I think you have done? - What have I done? - You have put your heart in the marble urn with the ashes. Oh, yes. And if in a storm sometimes, or sometime if a five-ton truck goes down the highway and the marble urn was to break... Look! Look, baronessa! Look what? I don't see. I was pointing to your heart. Broken out of the urn! Rondinella felice! Rondinella felice! Che buffone. I take you serious, and you make jokes. Your heart is a happy bird. When I can bring the shirt back? - When you pass by again. - I'll come back tonight, volete? OK. Then look at the window tonight. If the shutters are open and there is a light in the window, you can stop by for your shirt. But if the shutters are closed, you better not stop because my Rosa will be home. - Rosa? - Yeah. Rosa's my daughter. There's nothing wrong in two grown-up people having a quiet conversation, but Rosa's 15. I must be careful to set her a perfect example. - I will look at the window! - OK. I will look at the win... - Bang, bang! - Hey, you little monkey. - Get down off that truck. - Go chase your head! Come on. Come on. Get down. Here we go. Come on. Jump! You little monkey, you lay off of them bananas. They're the property of the Southern Fruit Company. Of which I am no longer a truck driver. Ciao. Hey, you! Oh, Rosario, forgive me for thinking the terrible lie could be true. Forgive me. You're in a mood. You act disgusted with me. Ever since you met Mother, you've acted different. How different? Cold. Honey, your mother made me understand the responsibility of... - Of what? - Loving a very young girl. I'm old enough to get married. Married? Yes! Married and have a baby. That's something to dream of. You dream. I am not a dreamer. I am not satisfied with dreams. Look, they can see us. Lift the anchor and take the boat out further. Miss Yorke has field glasses. Field glasses! Field glasses! Well, they're German military field glasses with 20 magnification. Field glasses! - Alvaro, what happened? - You didn't get enough games today? - Oh, che bello! - Here, wrap this up, quick. Subito. - What? What? - I borrowed it from the widow. - How's the Parchesi today? - Oh, she cheats me. Sei tu che sei un imbroglione! - Imbroglione? - On giochi bene, te I'ho detto! - Onna, gioca. Tocca a te. - Stupido! Anche tu! Anche tu! Perche' gli lasci prendere la-tua cravatta? Ma perche' tu imbrogli sempre, imbrogli sempre? On lo vuoi capire. - Hello. - Oh, hello. You...?

Formerly Yokohama. Very good. I want a rose tattooed here, here on my chest. You understand? A rose. OK. Six dollar. Oh, no. That's too much. I give you $2. OK. Four dollar. No stem. Just a rose. Two-fifty is all I got to spend on a rose tattoo, see? I'll show you. OK. Very good. Take off shirt. Sit down. But you got to make me a nice, big, beautiful rose, huh? But for $2.50, no leaf, no stem. Just the rose. - The rose is all I need. - OK. It's cold! I give you a little stem. Where is it? Where is it? Eccola qua. Quarda dov'era. Rondinella felice!

Look, your hair... - What's...? What's the matter, huh? I didn't expect to see you looking so pretty. You're a young little widow, you know? - You are... Fix yourself up. - Yeah. I went to the Ideal Barbers. I got the whole works, including the bath. - No! - Yeah. Magnifique! Oh, you got oil of roses in your hair. Si, si! Olio di rose. - You like the smell of it?

Ladies first. Shall we...? Shall we sit down on the sofa? Yeah. You... You take the sofa. I will sit down on this chair. But it's more easy to talk with two on the sofa. Yeah, but I lean back too far on that sofa, and I like a straight back behind me, you know? But it's more easy to talk with two on the sofa. You know what I mean? I talk just good on this chair as I talk on that sofa. Sit down, please. - Oh, can I help you? - Oh, no. I'll put it over there. - It's all right. - Thank you. - I got a good surprise for you. - Yeah? - Wait till you see. - No! Oh, my purse. - Father De Leo had it in his office. - Oh, thank you. Open it. Count the money. - Why should I count the money? - You're rich, and I'm poor. How do you know I didn't steal from you? Oh, such an idea. I would never think such a thing. I would never dream of it, believe me. I want you to know that I may be honest, but I'm poor. I'll put away the purse. - Excuse me, eh? - Sure. - Good evening again. - Good evening. Good evening. I bet you counted the money, huh? Yeah. I see you like make jokes again, huh? - I got another surprise for you. - No. What? - For you. - Oh, no! Chocol... Chocolate... Chocolates...

I made him promise to respect the innocence of my Rosa. But how do I know that he will respect the promise, you know? Oh, baronessa, you got to face facts. Sooner or later the innocence of your daughter cannot be respected if the family's gonna continue, you know? Please, don't make comparisons, huh? Did he have a tattoo? Did who have a what? "Did who have a...?" The sailor. The sailor your daughter has met, did he have a tattoo? Why do you ask me if he had a tattoo? Well, you know, most sailors have got tattoos. How do I know if he had a tattoo or not? Are you crazy? - I got a tattoo. - No, really? Yeah! Oh, you make me laugh. What kind of a tattoo you got? - What kind do you think? - Oh, it's easy. A South Sea girl without clothes on. - Oh, no, no. - I'm sure. - I'm sure. - No South Sea girl without clothes on. - No? - No, no. A big, red heart with "Mama". "Mama" written across it. You're wrong again, baronessa. - What kind of tattoo you got? - I show you. See? Well, what's the matter? - I'm sorry. - What's the matter? I don't feel good. Oh, I'm sorry, I... - I got to go outside. - I'm sorry, baronessa. I got to go outside to breathe, please. Mi dispiace molto. I didn't mean to surprise you. Don't talk about it. Anybody could have a rose tattoo. It don't mean nothing. - Sure, I know. - You know, I can't breathe. It's too hot tonight. You know how a tin roof is. Yeah, I know. It catches the sun all day, - and it don't cool off until midnight. - Yeah. Then it gets hot in the bedroom, and the covers, they... No, please! Please. We got a strega. A witch next door. Please! Please don't touch me! You got a bright house. - You're burning kilowatt hours. Why? - That's all right. You don't have to pay the light bill. Please! Yeah, I know. But don't you feel self-conscious with all the light on? Everybody looks in. They watch us. They see what we do. Nothing is going on here to be ashamed of. - Nothing. - Nothing! Nothing. Yeah. What are you doing that for now? You know, the night is warm, but my hands are freezing. - Bad circulation. - Too much circulation. I feel the sweet warmth of a lady. You know? You talk a sweet mouth to fool a... - To fool a woman, huh? - No, no, I know. That's what warms the world, what makes it summer. Without it, the rose wouldn't grow on the bush. The fruit wouldn't grow on the tree. And the truck would not haul the bananas, Mr. Mangiacavallo, I know! What, you don't like my poetry? No, I don't like your poetry! How can a man talk to you? No, please! Is that your poetry? Is that your poetry? Andate a casa. Cialtrone! - Go home! - Understanding is so necessary. - I understand plenty. Go home! - Please, baronessa. - Go home! Don't touch me! - So soft is a lady... Go home. Everything in my life turns out like this! Get up, you idiot's grandson! Get up! Please! Get up. Go home! And where is the shirt I loaned you? - What? - Yeah, where is the shirt I loaned you? My sister wrapped it up. She was happy I met this nice lady. Your sister. Now, Mr. Mangiacavallo, please. Tell me the truth about something. When you put on the tattoo on your chest, huh? When? I got it tonight. You got it because I told you about my husband's tattoo. No, I wanted to be near you, to make you happy, that's all. Tell it to the Marines, please. You are not smart enough. Now, take the shirt back. I don't want it! You can keep it now! You just asked me for it. What's the matter? Oh, you make me so nervous. Please! Is it my fault you been a widow too long? - You make a mistake. - You make a mistake. Both of us make a mistake tonight. Both of us make a mistake! You know, we should have been friends. I think maybe we meet on the wrong day. I'll go out again, come in. We start all over. No, no. I think it's no use, because the day was wrong to begin with. Because of two women. They told me my husband was having a steady affair with a woman at the Mardi Gras Club, you know? You know? What was the name on the shirt? On the slip of paper? - I threw it out the window. - Yeah, but tell me. You remember the name? What was the name? I remember the name because I know the woman. - What is...? - The name is Estelle Hohengarten. That was the name. That was the woman. Yeah. You made me forget for a little while. OK.

We dance maybe. - We have fun. - Let me go in, please, will you? Where is the woman Estelle Hohengarten, please? Where is the woman Estelle Hohengarten?

I'm the wife, remember? What is the lie? You liar! - Liar! - Estelle, tell her it's a lie. - Tell her! - What's a lie? Liar! Liar! Remember? I brought you the rose-colored silk to make him a shirt. You said, "For a man?" I said, "Yes, for a man that's wild like a Gypsy." Remember? I remember. Let me at her! Let go of me! Let me at her! I'll show her whether it's a lie or not. I have the proof. I have proof! What proof? Please! What proof? If she thinks it's a lie, let me show her this. This! See for yourself. His rose tattooed on my chest. Let go of me! I'm gonna kill her! I'm gonna kill her! Let me get at her! Let go of me! Let go of me! Oh! Let me go! Hey! - That'll be 2.50, please. - Two-fifty. - Two dollars? - Two dollars and fifty cents, yes, sir. Hey! - What did you do? - I smashed... I smashed the urn. Hey, mister. Two-fifty. - We don't have the money. - Well, just ask the lady. - The lady's sick. - What happened? - Her husband just died. - I'm sorry. - That's all right. - I'm sorry. Don't look at it. Don't look at it. Look outside. You know? Look out at the moon. - Yes. - Well, look at me. After a while, you will stop feeling the pain. I know. You need human comfort. Lean on me. I don't want that. What? Tell me. You go now. - I go? - Yeah, you go and come back. But leave the truck somewhere else. So everybody can't hear. And say to me in a loud voice: "Goodbye, Mrs. Delle Rose. We had a good conversation." Si, si, ho capito.

Hey! Please! Blood? Whiskey. Get up. Get up. Get up, you! A clown has passed out in my house. You want to sleep, huh? A clown like that with my husband's body. There. Go on. Don't wait for me. I want to walk home. When are you going back to New Orleans? Tomorrow. What time must you be on the boat? Ship. Why? Just tell me what time. Five. Why? What will you be doing till five? Well, what difference does it make? It don't make no difference to you what I'm gonna be doing. All right. All right, I'll tell you what I'm gonna be doing till five. I'm gonna check in at the Rampart Hotel. I'm gonna check in at the Rampart, and I'm gonna get loaded. Do me a little favor. Before you get loaded, look in the lobby of the Rampart Hotel at 12 o'clock noon. Why? You might find me there... ...waiting for you. Look, are you trying to buy me a ten-year stretch in the brig? I want you to give me the little gold ring to put on my finger. Are you talking about getting married? Yes. Yes, I want to give you my heart to keep forever and ever and ever. In all my born days, I never felt nothing so sweet as the feel of your warm little body in my arms. Honey... ...I gotta leave now. Do you understand? Only if you promise to be at the Rampart Hotel. I gotta go, Rosa! Look for me! I'll be there. Che bella. Che bella. Sporcaccione! Oh, baronessa. Baronessa! I didn't know what I was doing. I got all twisted around in the house. Young lady, I thought you was your mama. "Your mama"?! Oh, please! - Mama. Mama, stop! - Sporcaccione! Mama! - Baronessa, please! - Don't "baronessa" me. No, that's...!

I don't know. - Maybe the back door was open. - Yes, maybe it was. Why not, cara? Maybe... Maybe he climbed in a window. Or fell down the chimney, maybe. Why do you put on the white things I saved for your wedding, cara? Because I want to. That's a good enough reason. Rosa, darling. I want you to understand about that man, you know? That was a man... - That... That was... - You can't think of a lie? He was a truck driver, cara. He was chased by policemen. Did they chase him into your bedroom? Bedroom? In the dining room. I took pity on him. I gave him first aid. I let him sleep on the floor. - He gave me his promise, you know? - Did he get on his knees? Did he promise he would respect your innocence? Did he? Rosa. He was Sicilian. He had oil of roses in his hair. And the... And the rose tattoo of your father. I closed my eyes... ...and dreamed he was your father. But he came to me drunk, and he fell flat down on his face. Stop it! The only thing worse than a liar is a liar that's also a hypocrite! Rosa, don't look at me like that, with... With the eyes of your father. Yes, I look at you with the eyes of my father. I see you the way he saw you. - Don't, please. - Like this. This pig! I need $5 so I can go and find Jack. Go in. Go in the house. Thanks. Rosa... Rosa, I couldn't sleep. My Rosa. Rosa. My daughter, she has on the white things I saved for her wedding. Will...? Will you marry my daughter? Mama. That man didn't touch me. He just said "che bella." How beautiful she is, my daughter. Get up. Go with the boy. Oh, Mama. Oh, don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. Go with the boy.
