There's some rubbish there for you to dispose of. See you dispose it well, Jo and don't leave any mess. - Dispose of? I don't understand. - And if by any unlucky chance the rubbish is found by the authorities, I'm sure you know better than to mention my name. You can say that one of your visitors left it, hmm? (clock chimes) (gasps) - Police. - No! - We have to call the police. - No give it to me. - Surely you must call the police. - I beg you.

I've got to clear up the mess. Wash the knife, the fingerprints. Remember the fingerprints? (engine revving) - [Jo] Look at you, you drunken fool. I'll say you did it. I'll say you murdered Mark.

I don't know. I just don't understand. I mean Tom, he couldn't have anything to do with it. You don't believe it? - Of course not, Mary. No, I'm as much in the dark as you are. - Then where is he? Why doesn't he telephone? - Well, I'm sure he'll come here. - Oh but that won't be safe. If the police have questioned Tom's landlady, they'll be here any minute. - I doubt it. I don't think she knows your address. - Oh, then they'll go straight to the college. - The office doesn't open 'til ten. - Roy, you all went to this night club together? - Mmm-hmm. - Well then how did Tom, well I mean, why wasn't he with you? - We separated. - Why? Why did you separate? - Glynn and I, we saw these two girls home. Two of the hostesses. - And Tom? Tom took one home too. (door closes) (running footsteps) - Mary, I. - Tom, what's happened? Look, have you seen this? What's it all about? Does Mary? - Yes, I tried to explain about the night club and the rest but she didn't understand. It was useless. What happened after you left us? - Did you enjoy yourself with your hostess? - Mary, I can. - What was she, blonde or brunette? Probably a redhead, that's traditional isn't it? - I don't remember what color. What does it matter? - Oh but it does matter. It matters to me very much. - If you'll just give me a chance to explain. - Oh yes, explain that's what I want you to do. I want you to explain. - It isn't easy. Mary, you're so different. - Different from her, I dare say I am. I dare say I'm very different but you prefer her to me. - No. - You walked her home didn't you? You went back to her room. There could only be one reason. - No I didn't, it wasn't like that. I didn't know she was a. Glynn and Roy, we were tired of having to conform. We wanted to break loose before society swallowed us up and started us on a slow walk to the grave. I don't know, I can't explain. It's just that something inside wanted to revolt against conformity, to spit in its eye, that's all. Can't you understand. Mary, try to understand. - What if it were me? - You? - Yes, me, or do I have to stick to the rules? Conform? (slapping) I want to understand. I really do want to understand. (doorbell rings) - Any news, has he rung? - Tom. - He's here, oh thank God for that. What happened, Tom, for God's sake? - I don't know, I can't remember. - You can't remember? Well, you'll have to remember. - Don't you think I've tried? - What happened last night after you left with. - Mary knows. It's all so vague. I don't seem to be able to remember. It's all so jumbled. - Look, a body Tom. - The body was in the bedroom. It was covered in blood. I cut my hand, lookit you see? - The body, where was it? - Look. - Shut up, I want him to remember. - The body was in the bedroom. I remember a knife. - Go on. - Yes, I pulled it out. - You touched it? - Well it was in my hand. - God. - She told me to fetch the car and I did. - But why? Why did you? - She said she'd say I did it. That's right. She said, she'd blame me. - I mean, how could she? - He picked up the knife, his fingerprints were there. - Yes, my fingerprints and the room, the room was, I was drunk, I must have knocked into something the place was a shambles. Oh God, what a mess. - Did you discover the body? - No, she saw it first. She went to the phone. She answered it. That's it! She answered the telephone. Then she went straight to the body. There must be some connection. - Who phoned? - I think you should go to the police. - Go to the police, how can he? Look at the evidence against him. - Wait a minute. On the way in, there was someone. Limpy. No, Limey. No, that's right he walked with a limp. You could hear his walk in the street. She was frightened. I've gotta go back. I've gotta make her tell the truth. I'll get it out of her even if I. - No, you mustn't. You might be walking straight into a trap. - I've got to. I've got to go back. I can't just stay here. - No, let Glynn and Roy go. After all, we're all in this together. - Right. We'll telephone you if anything comes up. - Wait a minute. Offer her this, tell her she can have more if this is not enough. Anything, so long as she'll go to the police. (indistinguishable voices) - Mr Mikala? - So be it ,you want to buy a book? - Not just now sir. The flat upstairs, it belongs to you? - Yes, but I don't live in it. Look as much as you like, the price is inside the cover. I rent it out, it helps to pay for the shop. It's a fallacy. There's no prophet in knowledge. - Does a Mr. Mark Davis live there? - No, well, at least he didn't pay the rent. Miss Jo, she pay the rent, I lent the flat to her but he stayed there most of the time. My wife says it isn't right. I said what am I, their landlord or their keeper? If so I should keep consciences? So long as she pays the rent don't matter to me who. - Miss Josephine Lake? - Yes. So you don't find what you want, go inside. I have plenty more inside. - Do you happen to know where I might find her now? - Now? No idea, I saw her going out to shop while ago. I don't know where. She was carrying a suitcase. Where to? Who knows? - A suitcase? Have you any idea at all where she might be going? Me? No officer, she paid her rent, that's all I ask. Now gentleman, what kind of book? Trouble, that's all they ever bring, trouble. Those two now. They might have bought three, four, five books. Who knows? Oh well. - Hey, you remember us? We were sitting over there last night. - No. - But you must have done. - But we were busy. - Look, we were sitting with three girls, Lucy, Gloria and Jo. Now we wanna find Jo. - Look, we're closed. We don't give girls' addresses here. - Look it's not like that, this is important. Well, do you know a man with a limp then? A man called Limey or Limpy? - I said we're closed. - Were they here last night? - I don't remember. - Were they here last night? - Yes. - Did one of them go with Jo? - No. Their pal did. (phone ringing) - Yes? - Oh, two boys have just been here looking for Jo. - So? - Their friend left with her last night. They also asked about a man with li- About a man called Limpy or Limey. I showed 'em the door. By the way, they have company. A plain clothesman is on their tail. Hello? - Come in lads. (clock chiming) Those two last night, Jo and the boy, find them. (tape crinkling) (church bells ringing) - Well, keep your fingers crossed Roy. This is our last chance. Wish me luck. (church bells ringing) (door bell buzzing) - Hey, what's the idea? - I wanna talk to you Lucy. Can I come in? - Help yourself. - It's about Jo. - Oh look, what is this? Waking me up at this time in the morning to ask me about another girl? Well if that's all you've come for you can get. - No, look, it isn't for me, it's for my friend. You know, the one who won the prize. - Oh him? 100 pounds wasn't it? Why'd you have to stop him choosing me? - Look he wants to find Jo. - Well he knows where she lives doesn't he? He went back there. - Yeah, she's not there. She left this morning. - On her own? - I think so why? - Funny, Mark and her must have quarreled or something. - Look have you got any idea where she's gone? - No why? - I told you because my friend wants to know. - Is he the grateful sort? - Grateful? - Yes grateful, you know. - That won't buy much. - Well there's more if you know where she's gone. - It's a pity I don't then. - You don't? - No, she come from Bradford. Perhaps she's decided to go back there. Why don't you try St. Pancras? (door bell buzzes) Now what is it? - St. Pancras, what a help. - It's the only one we've got so far. - She doesn't know she's gonna be there, she only through it in as a sort of. - What else is there? Have we got any other lead? Unless you've got some brilliant suggestions to make? It's worth a try anyway. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hello Tom? Listen. - St. Pancras? Well it's better than stewing here. I'm coming now. (indistinct voice making announcements) I'll just get a paper. (indistinct voice making announcements) (train whistle blows) (train chugging) (indistinguishable chatter) - Tom! - Going on holidays, Jo? - Why what's it to you? - Not a thing, once you've come with me to a police station. - Why, don't you know the way? - You're going to tell them the truth, Jo. - Truth about what? - About last night. - Last night? - Yes, last night when I came home with you. - When you came home with me? - Oh she's just playing for time, Tom. - Who phoned you last night? - Phoned? Did somebody phone? I don't remember. I wasn't there. - What do you mean you weren't there? - You'll have to watch him, ya know. He gets very violent when he's jealous. - What the hell are you talking about? - Last night. God knows what you'd been up to. When I came back the place was. - Back? Back from where? - A walk. Don't you remember, I went for a walk? And left you to it. - Left me to what? The body? - What body? I don't remember a body. You were alone as far as I know. Although from the state the place was in when I came back, you could have been fighting. - [Glynn] What's she talking about? - Nothing, it's all bluff. Tell the truth. Just tell the truth. - I've told you the truth. If you don't like it, that's too bad. - Then why are you running away? If there's nothing then why are you running away? - Running away? I'm not running away, I'm going home. A girl's entitled to go home if she wants to. - Look Jo, don't you realize what you're doing? Don't you realize the mess Tom's in? - Why what's he done? - Can't you read? - Ah what's the use, Tom? You're wasting your time. She won't budge. - She's got to. Jo, please listen to me. The police think I killed him. The body was in my car and they think I killed him. All I'm asking you to do is tell the truth. Look Jo, you can have this. More if you want. Anything, if you only tell them I didn't do it. - Didn't do what? - God I can't. - That won't help. That won't do anything. - Tom, why don't you and Roy see if you can find this man, this Limey, while Glynn and I hand her over to the police. - The police, hmm. - Oh you won't be so. - Tom! This way. Tom, over there quick. - Oh no, no you don't. You're not coming through this. - Who are you? What the devil is going on? - Kleinie let me go, please let me go. - Where is he? Where's he gone? You young fools, you don't know what you're mixed up in. His life may be in danger. - He didn't do it, he really didn't do it. - I've got to find him, quickly, before someone else does. - A man with a limp. - They were picked up in a car. - Describe it. - Well it was a black saloon. The number was MSS465. - Sargent, begin on the left. - Is there anything we can do to help. - Yes, pray. He'll need your prayers now as never before. - There's nothing to worry about, Tom. We're gonna look after you. Tom and Jo, we're gonna see you safe from the police. - Let me go, I won't say anything. I promise I won't say anything. Kleinie, I'll do anything you say. I'll do anything you say, anything. - Don't get emotional, Jo. I want you to enjoy your ride. You're an educated lad, Tom. Do you happen to know a poem called "The Last Ride Together?" - Kleinie, I beg you. - You got out of your depth, Jo. You and poor old Mark. Now you've just got to disappear. Very unwise, but Tom'll be there. He'll keep you company. Romantic don't you think? Killin' the boyfriend and fleeing with the girl. Should make quite a story, eh Jo? - They'll never believe it. - No, you're quite right. They're very incredulous aren't they? But then on the other hand, they'll have no choice will they? (wind blowing) - Stay where you are.
