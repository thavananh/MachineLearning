They're lookin' more organized here. Savoy. Oh, he takes it down the boots with such ease. It's lovely to watch. He's got a bit of trouble coming here. - Go! Oh! Look at that footwork! And it's no problem for Savoy. Brilliant! - Hey, to me, to me. Over to your teacher! Yeah! Patty, you open? Oh, that's a lovely ball. An excellent first touch, and it looks like... Is he gonna go for it? - Guys, over to you! Take your shot. Oh, he's created a real chance here! Savoy! Goal! And it's a goal! Absolutely sensational! - Great game, everybody. Let's go to the mat. That was incredible. Incredible soccer. Hey, Ania, come sit with us. Let's go. Okay, everybody, can I let you in on a little secret? - Yes. - Sure. - You have to promise to listen very carefully. I talked to Santa. What? - I know, I know it's a big deal, and he told me that this year he's so swamped that he wants my help getting some of his gifts to you. Is that okay? Yeah. - Okay then. - Yeah, cool. - Now, this next part is very, very important. You can't open these until Christmas morning, okay? - Got it, Miss B. - Okay. Now, can anybody tell me what you're most excited about for Christmas? - Santa. - Rudolph. Miss B, what about you? Well, I'm excited because this year I'm going all the way to London, England to visit my little sister for Christmas. - Harry Styles lives there. - Yes, he does. Nice one, Piper. Oh, everybody, it's officially Christmas break Brinker Bears. Yay! Let's go! - Let's go! - Come on! Savoy looks like he's in a lot of pain there. Team physio just taking a look at that knee, but when people go down like that with that much pain, it's rarely good news. - Spence? - Next time I catch you watching this, I'm throwin' it in the Thames. - If I'd been a split second quicker. - Yeah, they'd have missed you and collided into each other, I know. Look, I promised you I'd ask you this. Will you please consider goin' out with a girl from our office? - It's too hard to date when I'm playing. Especially when I'm recovering. - Right, well, have you given any more thought to next year? As your manager I'll need an answer after Christmas. Endorsement deals depend on it for contract renewals. - I don't know what to do, mate. It's not just me. What about the fans, my family, the team? I can't imagine not playing, but I also know I can't play forever. - Word of advice, from your friend, you're the only one who can decide when you're done. - I do want to win the Champions League with Newbourne, and I can come back from this. - Well, you're not 25 anymore, mate. It's not gonna be as easy this time. At some point all this is gonna go away and you need to be okay. Your family needs to know you're gonna be okay. I get a call from Lynn every other day asking for updates. - Told my mum to stop doing that. Look, Jill and I are taking the kids to visit the folks in Birmingham. I suggest you do the same. - I don't think Jill would appreciate that. Rest. Enjoy Christmas with your family for once and really think about what you're asking of yourself. Then you can tell me your decision, right? Merry Christmas, mate. - Happy Christmas. - Hi. I can't believe you're finally here! - I can't believe you live in a flat and take the tube and say things like lorry and lift. Your baby sister is all grown up. - I can see that. - Is that all you brought? - Well, why over pack when I can raid your cool London closet. - Not happening. - It's absolutely happening. You brought the peanut butter, right? - Yes Ma'am, two jars. - Good, it tastes different over here. We need ours or Mom's cookies won't be perfect. What about Mom's stocking? - Dad's bringing it. - Hm. We should remind him. You're reliable but Dad on the other hand- - I will text him right now. Stocking's on the way. - Perfect. Thank you. Oh, you'll never guess what showed up as a memory on my phone yesterday. - What? ♪ Merry Christmas ♪ Oh, yeah Remember? Our dance was incredible. - Yeah, because you forced me to practice it until it was perfect. - It was worth it. I mean, we did win Best Sibling Dance Duo at the Christmas talent show that year. - I'm pretty sure that's only because mom volunteered to head the Easter Egg Hunt Committee an hour before they announced the winners. - Wait, is that true? - Oh. Yeah, sweetie. - Hey. - Hey. - It's good to see you. - On the house. Happy Christmas. It's good to see you, young man. - Thanks, Mary. You too. - Boys are no good without you. - Mary! - I'm coming. I'm coming. - Cheers. - Cheers. - So, uh, thanks for the call. You've been a bit elusive lately. How are things? How's the, uh, how's the knee? - It's great, actually. We're starting against Tottenham next week. - Oh, I wish you were. - Me too. Is your work good then? - You know, investment banking has its perks. I rarely get body slammed and, uh, I can dine without strangers takin' my picture. - Must be nice. Come on, you love your life. You're literally living the dream. - Look at you. You have a job that doesn't consume everything you do, a woman you adore, and if you have a bad hair day, nobody cares. - Eh, I care. You don't have to wonder if people in your life are genuine, or if they want something from you. Women are only interested in me because I'm the captain of Newbourne. They don't care who I really am. - Yeah. - Uh, I'm just having a day. Enough of my pity party. Tell me something good about you. - Um, okay, but you have to promise not to tell anybody. I'm going to propose at, Christmas. - That's a big step. - Yeah. - You ready for that? - Look, I know you're not exactly around all that often, but I'm telling you because I've never been more sure of anything in my entire life. - Wow. My little brother's getting married. - I don't need your approval, but I would like your support. - She's a great girl. If you're confident now is the right time, that's all that matters, and I'm here for you. Cheers. - Cheers. - I'll get my best man speech ready, shall I? It's so cute in here. It's a little messy but cute. What's with the sad empty tree? - Oh, I was waiting for you. Every year for my entire life we've decorated the tree together. It's tradition. Also, I don't have any ornaments. Right. Are you sure Henry's okay staying at his parents while I'm here? - Oh, it was his idea. He said he wanted us to have our sister bonding time. Look, my Christmas Pinterest board. - Wow, you are really goin' for it. - Yeah, I have to. It's necessary for my to-do list, which I just sent to you along with our itinerary. We've been working so much, I'm a little behind. Well, a lot behind. - Well, good thing I'm here to help. - Oh yes, thank you. You are going to love the Carters. You'll meet them at brunch. I just want everything to go well and everyone to get along. - Oh, it will. We will. "Wrapping paper, ribbon, tape." Wait, what are Christmas crackers? Are those like crackers with Santa's face on them? - I don't actually know, I was just told to get them. Henry's mom said there must have for a traditional English Christmas. - Then we must get them. - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm. - I figure in the morning we'll head to the market so you can see all the shops. Then we can tag in the list. - Sounds like a plan. Missed you. - I missed you too. So beautiful. I know. - I have news. Remember how I told you that I applied to the University of Indiana? Well, I finally heard back from them and I got into their Occupational Therapy Program with a scholarship. - Oh, stop it. For real? - Mm hm. - Oh, I bet Dad's buzzing. I'm so proud of you. - Actually, I haven't told him yet. - Why not? I thought Indiana was your first choice. - For my master's programs it is. I just, I need to make sure that that's still what I want, and Dad would be crushed if he knew that I got in and I wasn't going. - Well, why wouldn't you go? - Well, a few weeks ago my principal nominated me for this other program called SED Abroad, and it's kind of a big deal. She can only nominate one person a year and I'm waiting to hear if I got accepted. - But what about your scholarship? - Well, if I got into SED Abroad, I would literally be paid to travel the world and teach special education. - Isn't that what you do now? - Except for the traveling the world part. - That does sound really cool, but we both know you were going to wind up in Indiana. You always make the reliable and responsible choice. - I haven't always had the choice not to. - Graham Savoy fan, are we? - Yeah, he's like my favorite player. - Mine, too. Can you keep a secret? He's my eldest. No way. Oh, way. I'll tell you what, you get that jumper and I'll throw in a Newbourne Santa hat as a gift. - Are you sure? - Oh yes, I'm sure, my dear. My store, my rules. - That's awesome. But wait a minute, how do I know that you are actually his mum? - Please don't do it. Please. ♪ Graham - How's work going by the way? - Uh... - You museum curator yet? - Not even close. - Well, everything takes time, and look at what you have accomplished. You work at the Museum of Britain. It's what you moved to London for in the first place. - Yeah, no, it's true. I'm learning so much and don't get me wrong, my boss Marnie asks a lot of me, but in a good way. She wants me to succeed and she trusts me too. - Well, don't let this go to your head, but I'm very proud of you. - Really? - Yeah. - Thanks, Sissy. This would look better on you. - Hiya. - Oh my god, you're like my actual hero. - Oh, that's so nice. Thank you. - Let's take a photo. Here, gimme your phone. Come on, I'll do it. All right. Now, big smiles. Lovely. Oh, my dear. Oh, you're going to love it. Now don't forget, tag Lynn's Christmas Shop when you post. - Mum? Happy Christmas. - Thank you so, so much. Merry Christmas. This is like, the best day of my life. - If we want any hope of carrying out our tradition, we have to get you some ornaments. Pretty. - It's my boss. Hi, Marnie. Uh huh. Yep. Okay, I'll, I'll be there as soon as I can. I have to head into work. I'm sorry. - Aren't you supposed to be off this week? - Marnie uses that phrase liberally. - Well, is there anything I can do to help? - Thank you, but no. Why don't you go and explore and I'll meet you back at the flat in a few hours. - Of course. Go, I'll see you soon. - It's lovely, isn't it? - It, it reminds me of one that my mom used to have. We lost it in a move years ago, and I never thought I'd see one like it again. - This artist had a very unique style. Only made a handful of them. It's yours if you like. - Thank you. I love it. Sorry, love. Good luck. ♪ Oh, captain ♪ Oh, captain How's the knee? - Getting better every day. Thanks, everyone. Go Newbourne! - Come and get your t-shirts here, especially made for Christmas and it's for his non-profit. - Oh! - Watch where you're going. - You walked into me. Oh no! - Forgive me. Let me buy you another, please. - Unfortunately you can't. It's just... It, it was the last one. Oh gosh, I'm a mess. - Can I at least help you get cleaned up? Offer you a towel or something? I live nearby. Well, my parents do. - How far away exactly? - Five minute walk. I swear I don't bite, and I'm genuinely very sorry for the spill. - Sure. I'm Georgia, by the way. It's usually this is the part where you respond with your name. - That's funny. What's funny? - You're serious? - What do you, want me to guess? - I'm Graham. - Like the cracker. - Like the cracker. So, what brings you to Notting Hill? - Celebrating Christmas with my little sister. We haven't missed one together since we were kids. - Here we are. Whoa. - Uh, right this way. - Oh. So, what happened to your leg? - Um, my leg? - Well, I noticed you limping back there. - I, uh, tore my ACL playing football. Or as you Americans incorrectly like to say, soccer. You play? - Not at the moment. - Well, I tore my ACL playing soccer back in high school. - You play? - No, not anymore. I miss it, though. You know, I used to dream about having a jersey with my name on it. Oh, well. - Perhaps you and I should play some time. Football, that is. - I wish. The itinerary my sister gave me pretty much has me booked through the new year. - Right. - Also, your knee. - Right. I forgot, I have an appointment. - And I should probably... - Right. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. Just do it. - We have to leave for brunch in two minutes! - I'm ready. Hey, don't be nervous. Hello. - Lizzie. - Oh, hey babe. - Hey. - Georgia, this is my boyfriend, Henry. - So nice to finally meet you. - Nice. Georgia, this is everyone. Everyone, this is Georgia. - Hello, Georgia. - Hi, Georgia. - This is my Mum and Dad, Lynn and Archie Carter. - Pleased to meet you. - Welcome. - It's my Aunt Sarina and baby cousin, Ella. - I'm 10! - My apologies. - Sit beside me, Lizzie. - And this is Howard, the actor of the family. - I love your necklace. - Thank you. Thank you all for having me. It's so nice to finally meet you. - It's our pleasure. Now, Lizzie tells me this is your first visit to London. - Guilty. - Well, Christmas is the spectacular time to be here. There's so much to do and to see. - Do you like football? - I'll have to see if we can get you to a game. Although, our favorite team is rather lacking at the moment. - Yeah. - Hm. Really missing our star striker. - Where is your brother? - Uh, he should be here. I'll text him. - So Georgia, tell us all about yourself. Favorite hobbies, favorite Christmas traditions, food allergies? - Mum! - What? What? She's Lizzie's sister. I want to get to know her and so should you. - So, are you single? - Very, very. And my hobbies are pretty slim at the moment. I could work on that, but teaching's my life. Yeah, clever girl. A career woman is a passionate one. - As usual, he's not coming. - Ha! Pay up. - What? Wait, you bet on my first born not attending family brunch? - I make my money when I can. Thank you. Unbelievable. - Do you remember when I bet Henry- - And you bet me. - But it worked. - Thankfully, yes. I embarrassed myself so badly that day. - So did I. - I'm sure Lizzie's told you, but I was the former Egyptian antiquities curator at the museum, and when Lizzie was interning, I thought it might be fun to set these two up. - He bet both of us to talk to the other, but he left out the fact that he knew who each of us were. Archie also recommended me for my current job, so I basically have him to thank for everything. - So, now I'm retired. I live vicariously through our Lizzie. - Henry's family seems to love you. I didn't realize how close you were. How come I don't know more about them? - You know about them. - Well, not like they know about you. - You will. Trust me, you'll love them by the end of the trip. - Hey, honey. Hey look, I'm so sorry I couldn't make it over with your sister, but work has been nuts. - Hi, Dad. - Oh, hey. Good, you're both there. I got a very important question for you guys. Just hold on. - Dad? - I thought we said no Hawaiian shirts this year. - Did we? I don't remember. So, which should I choose? Neither. Okay, I'll bring both, and your mom's stocking, okay? I love you. Can't wait to see you girls. - Do you think Dad will like him? - Since when do you care if dad likes one of your boyfriends? - I've always cared. I don't seem to recall you caring when he highly disapproved of Tristan, or Jess, or Dean. - Uh, okay. Point taken. I don't know. This one, he's, he's different. - I haven't seen you this smitten since you were 15 and in love with Ryan Reynolds. - I swore I was gonna marry him someday. - It's too bad that Blake beat you to the punch. - You know how Dad describes seeing Mom for the first time? - The Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Bloomington their freshman year? - The canopy of Christmas lights illuminated her like a halo. - And he knew she was the one. - It feels like that with Henry. I'd do anything to ask Mom what that moment was like for her. You're lucky. - How do you figure? - You got more time with her. - Did you do that? - You? - No. - Oh, we have to. - Oo, the David Archuleta version. Okay, microphones. ♪ Merry Christmas ♪ Happy holidays ♪ Oo, yeah ♪ We've been waiting all year for this night ♪ - Oh, my sock! ♪ And the snow is glistening on the trees outside ♪ ♪ All the stockings are hung by the fireside ♪ ♪ Waiting fro Santa to arrive ♪ Merry Christmas, happy holidays ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas ♪ Merry Christmas ♪ Merry Christmas ♪ Happy holidays - Where's Lizzie today? - Uh, shopping and sightseeing with her sister. Thanks for coming. - You're welcome. How about this one? - Eh, it's all right. So, how are you doing? - Did Mum ask you to check on me? Excuse me? - She said you've been in a bit of a mood. For what it's worth, I think you can be. You've got some big decisions to make. We don't have to talk about it, but it's me. - I don't know what I'm gonna do. - You'll know when the timing's right. Thank you. I hope you're right. - I usually am. That's it. That's the one. - Have you seen my badge? I'm so sorry, but I have to go into work again. - I saw it on the coat rack. - Aw, you're the best! Also, I need a favor. We're running outta time and there's still a few things to pick up from the to-do list. Would you mind getting the Christmas crackers and whatever else is left? - Yeah, don't worry, I'll take care of it. - Thank you. I won't too long. Also, don't forget, we have the pantomime this afternoon. Bye. - The what? - Thanks for this, Graham. Do you mind keeping this safe? - Oh, yeah. - Appreciate it. - Sure. - Gotta go. No worries. All right, it's Spencer. You're lucky it's Christmas and people are cheerful. I rearranged your "Guardian" interview to 1:30. Graham? I'm glad you're spending time with family. Excuse me? Georgia, right? - Yes. Graham like the cracker. Hi. - Are you busy right now? I could, uh, buy you another cup of hot chocolate. You're still trying to make up for that ornament? - You caught me. - Well, thank you so much for the offer, but I was just about to head out. - Oh. - Oh, no, not like that. Please, please, take a seat. I have firm instructions to pick up these special British crackers with Santa's face on them for my sister. - Christmas crackers. - Yes. - I almost hate to break it to you, but Christmas crackers are not crackers with Santa's face on. They're party poppers. - Party poppers? - It's a noisy, explosive tube filled with a tissue paper hat, small toy and a bad joke. It's a Christmas staple in the UK. - Do you know where I can get said party poppers? - I know just the place. Come on. Oh , you don't have to do that. - I'm heading that way anyway. - Oh. - Excuse me? - I believe it's yours. Thank you. I don't know what I would've done if I had lost this. Thank you, seriously. Happy Christmas. The way the girls look at you, it's like you put them in some sort of trance and it was not just the barista. Other people were staring too. - I just, uh, have that effect on people. - Oh. So, who's the jewelry for, your girlfriend? - No. - Hm. - It's actually for my brother to give to his soon to be fiance. - Plot twist. - Which I now realize I wasn't supposed to tell anyone, so maybe just keep that to yourself. - Who am I gonna tell? I don't know your brother or his girlfriend. - Go Newbourne! - What does "Go Newbourne" mean? - Oh, it's a football chant. The morale round here is very community driven. So, uh, what do you do back home? - I'm a special education teacher. - What's that like? - Humbling, stimulating, all consuming. I love it, and I adore my kids. My mom's also a teacher, so I'm following in her footsteps, carrying on the tradition. - Sounds fulfilling. - It is. Can I ask you a question? - Is it a trick question? - No, I'm just curious since you're more or less a complete stranger. Given the opportunity to do something great but predictable, or risky but potentially life-changing, what would you do? - You sure this isn't a trick question? I don't know why I asked you that, I'm sorry. I'm kind of at a crossroads in my life and I'm trying to figure out what to do next. I've just always done what's expected of me and I don't know if that's because it's what I actually wanna do, or if I'm just scared to do anything else. And that probably makes no sense to you. - No. It actually makes a lot of sense. I'm at a bit of a crossroads in my life, too. - Um, I think some random dude is following us. - I'll take care of it. You need to leave. - Yeah, no worries, mate. - He won't bother us again. - Thank you. So, any other siblings? - Uh, just my younger brother. - Oh, so we're both the older and wiser ones? - I don't know about that. My brother seems to have it all figured out, whereas I don't. Sounds like my sister and I. So, what do you do for work? Uh- - Oh. Excuse me. One second. Hi. You okay? I'm still stuck at work, so Henry's going to pick you up for the pantomime. It's a British tradition, you'll love it. - Okay, sounds good. I'll see you then. - I love you, Graham Savoy! - Who are you? - Georgia, wait. - I don't get it. Why did you lie to me? - Technically, I didn't lie to you. I just omitted my career. I didn't tell you who I was because everybody always knows who I am. You didn't seem to know and I wanted to see what that felt like. I never get to be just Graham. I always have to be Graham Savoy. It's exhausting having to be on all the time, especially now since my knee hates me and I'm dealing with that pressure. You have no idea what it's like to have people wanting things from you all the time. - Everyone has pressure and issues. Yours might be under a bigger microscope, but you're not the only person who feels like they have to put up a wall to protect themselves. - I hadn't thought about it like that. Keep up the good work. - Can you sign my boots, please? - Sure thing. What's your name, sweetheart? - Leah. - Like Leah Williamson? - Captain of the Lionesses. - That's right. Happy Christmas, Leah. - Mr. Savoy, thank you so much and happy Christmas to you. - Happy Christmas. - I have to go. Um, thank you for your help. And it was nice meeting you. - Likewise. Good luck with everything. - You too. Goodbye, Graham. Goodbye, Georgia. - So, this pantomime we're going to is a Carter family tradition? - Yeah. It's this show that families attend at Christmas, but this year is a bit more special. My cousin Howard, you met him at brunch, he is making his debut as the dame. - The dame? Hm. - Oh, right, it's... Imagine if "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" had a baby with a Disney movie and half the cast was dressed in drag. - Fantastic. - Yeah, it's brilliant. It's a total blast. - I can't wait. - So, did Lizzie tell you we were picking Secret Santa after the show? - She didn't. - My advice is get in and get out. Mum takes it way too seriously and redraw if you pull on Sarina. Just trust me. - Oh. Duly noted. So, you and my sister are pretty serious? - Well, yeah, I'd say so. Why, did she say something? - Relax, Henry. Nothing to worry about. So, tell me, what's your deepest, darkest secret? You're joking? Well, uh, for the record, I am terrified of marshmallows. They look too much like the Michelin Man. - Really? Oh, you're joking. Touche. - Yeah. Hi, everyone! I'm so sorry I'm late. - Oh, Lizzie. - Here they are. - Show them. - Okay, come on, let's go. It's happening! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show! ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ On a one horse open sleigh Oh, all right. Do you wanna see some more? - Oh! - One, two, three, four, five. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle all the way ♪ - Encore, encore, encore! - Woo! You were absolutely incredible, bravo. - So sorry, I just need to borrow him. Hey, Georgia, let me introduce you to my brother. Graham, this is Lizzie's sister, Georgia. - Oh. Georgia, was it? - Yes. Yes. Yes, Georgia is my name, yep. - Right. So glad you're finally meeting. Great to see you, Graham. - You too, Lizzie. - Can you help me out? I'm trying to flip the camera, but it just won't work. - Oh, yeah, I'm happy to. You both love soccer. - Football. - Take that up with her. Come on. - Um. - Out of all the professional soccer players in this country you had to be Henry's brother? - Technically, he's my half brother. Same mum, different dad. - I'm familiar with the concept. - Secret Santa, my dears. Oh. - Archie, what are you doing? You know you have vertigo. - We're making a TikTok. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Your brother is my sister's boyfriend, which means he's gonna propose. - Sh, sh, sh. - We're all headed to the pub. Are you good? - Mm-hm. - Yeah. - Okay, let's go, guys. - Yeah, I agree. - Well, this isn't awkward at all. - No, not at all. - So your brother and my sister? - Apparently. - Well, at least we can bond over the fact that our significantly younger siblings are gonna get married before we do. - Yeah. - Not me and you. You know, me as an individual and you as an individual. - Right. Thanks for clarifying. In all seriousness though, I do like Lizzie for Henry. They're really great together. I've honestly never seen two people more compatible. - Really? - It's hard to explain. The more time you spend with them, the more it makes sense. - You don't get one now, you don't get one. - How come you didn't tell me who Henry's brother is? - What do you mean, I did? - You said that he played football professionally. You didn't say he was like, famous. - I don't know. I guess I don't see him that way. To me he's always been Henry's older brother who comes around every so often and is always really nice to me. Did Henry happen mention anything to you about proposing? - Oh, no. No. - I feel like he's going to propose, but I don't know. What do you think? - Darts? Loser buys next round? - Georgia? - Uh, are you sure you're ready for that? - Yes. - Well, it's a huge lifelong decision and you're very young. This is your first serious relationship. There's no reason to rush it. - I love him. - Why didn't you tell me how serious you and Henry are? - I figured by inviting you to spend Christmas with his family you'd get the hint. Why aren't you being supportive? - I'm being practical. Go on, Graham. - I think you're better at footy than you are darts. - How long have you been dating, eight months? - I don't need your judgment. I'm ready. If you can't see that, then maybe you don't know me as well as I thought you did. - Maybe I don't. Um. - I'll be right back. - Yeah. Yeah, me too. Hey, you all right? - You all right? Yeah, I just needed some fresh air. - Tell you what, I need some fresh air too. Come sit with me. - It's true. We really don't know each other like we used to, and it's entirely my fault. - Hey, how can you say that? - Because I'm the one who moved halfway across the world. - Come here. Hey. - It's just complicated between us. After my mom passed away, I helped my dad raise her and I even went to community college so I could stay close by and help her through high school. And I know I'm overprotective, but it just feels like it's my duty to take care of her. - We lost my dad when I was a boy. It's life-changing. Something's ingrained in us to keep the memory alive however we can, to follow in their footsteps, take care of their people. I'm sorry about your mum. - I'm sorry about your dad. How old were you? - 10. It's a long time ago, but it still hurts. - Yeah, I know how you feel. I just didn't realize how much I missed of her life, and how much she missed of mine. - I get it. - You do? - I can't remember the last time I spent longer than a couple of hours at Christmas with my family. I'm usually traveling or training or prepping for a match on Boxing Day. The only reason I'm even able to be here tonight is because I am injured. Even now, I still have to be at rehab, do extra media. - Yeah, but you live in the same city. - My point is just because we don't see the people we love as often as we like, doesn't mean we love them any less. - I should, um, probably go find Lizzie. - Yeah. It's, uh, probably best. - I didn't see anything. - That's inside out. - I know how to put on a duvet cover. - Okay, but it's inside out. Dad's landing in an hour. - Why don't I just go meet him since you've not had breakfast yet. - Okay. But whatever this is between us, we should figure it out. - My mates and I just started a nonprofit footy club for underprivileged kids in the area, and since I'll be here, I'll be able to be a bit more hands on, which I'm excited about. We're really wanting to provide now outlet for kids who might not otherwise have the access. - Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas! - Dad? Just put the presents in the living room, Dad. I think I might've overdone it. Can you help? Oh! - Oh, Dad! God, it is so good to see you! - Oh, hello, honey. - Welcome to my flat. Let me show you to your room. Okay. Oh, this is nice. - Oh, I'm so glad you're here. I can't wait to show you everything, and for you to meet Henry and the Carters. Also, I thought maybe I could swing you by the museum so you can see where I work. - I would love nothing more, my little lizard. I am so proud of you for following your dreams. Who would've thought my kid working in the Museum of Britain? - I know, it's crazy, right? - I brag about you all the time. - Oh! - I wish your mom could be here to see all this. - Yeah, me too. - Should we go and put her stocking up? Oh, both my girls together. I miss this. Oh. Well, you know, I just have to lie down. No, Dad, you have to stay awake, it's too early. - I don't know what time it is and I don't care. - Well, just in case you don't reappear again today, tomorrow morning, Henry's mum, Lynn, has invited us to a traditional Christmas bake. - Okay, why don't you guys go and then when you come back, I will be rested and ready for sightseeing? Goodnight girls. - So- - I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry. I just feel like I've missed so much of your life since you moved and it took me by surprise. We used to be so close. - We still are, aren't we? - Well, I had no idea how close you were to Henry's family, and when I heard that you were ready to get married, I panicked. How can I not know that my baby sister is ready to get married? - Well, to be fair, I didn't exactly give you a heads up. Why? - I was worried what you'd think. You're my favorite person in the world. You practically raised me and I trust you and value your opinions more than anybody. I was scared. I thought you'd be more likely to approve if you saw us together first. - The only thing I care about is that you're happy, and that he treats you well, and that he knows that I'm your favorite person in the world. Hey. Well, I don't even know if he's going to propose this year anyway. One second I have no doubt that he's going to, and then the next, I feel like there's no way. I don't know, maybe he's not ready. Maybe I'm not. - Don't overthink it. Come here. - I am sorry for being distant. Literally and metaphorically. - There's no need to apologize for living your best life. I'm happy for you. We're just gonna have to work a little harder on staying in touch, that's all. - Especially if you're going to be traveling the globe. - That's TBD. - I think you should do it. I added something to your pros list. I saw it on the chair. - Once in a lifetime experience. - Indiana will always be there for you. And if there's anybody who deserves a once in a lifetime opportunity, it's you. - So, if I get in and that's a big if, you think I should do it? Yeah. Hey. - Morning. How are we doing today, Graham? - Well, I'd be a lot better if I was out playing with the team. - You're definitely healing slower than last time, which is to be expected. I would've liked to see you a little further on in your recovery by now. - When do you think I can be back? Ow! - When that stops bothering you.
