There are many extras on this DVD, but there is one special one. It's definitely worth a look. Movie add-on. Fighter Rizhesera Iguchi Noboru. "Shy Machine Gun Girl." Enjoy watching! Great shot, Noboru! Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Hey! What are you going to do with this machine gun? A girl named Ami Hyuga was killed by the dregs of society! You took it! Really... Perhaps you mistook me for Ami? Unfortunately, I'm not who you thought I was. But. I knew Ami very well. It's because she was my best friend! You! Correctly. I should be a dead high school student. People call me "Yoshie Loose Socks"! You have both hands! What are you going to do with the machine gun? I'll just bend my hand! Lelouch_CG Present. Shy Machine Gun Girl. Great shot! Hooray! Hurrah Hurrah! You must be surprised. Seeing me firing a machine gun. This is true. I died once. Those yakuza killed me because I was Ami's friend. I should have gone to heaven after that blow to the head. But God gave me another chance. Where I am? Hey, I'm not done yet! Stop! What are you doing with my head? I stitch up the wound. If the wound had been a millimeter deeper, your brain would have been completely destroyed. Who are you? I, too, was on the brink of death because of those yakuza. My friends call me "Immortal Suguru". Suguru? Are you Ami's best friend? Ami? Do you know Ami? Where's she? I feel like I betrayed Ami and I should apologize to her. Ami... The yakuza are still chasing her and she goes into hiding. Ami... I was saved! She cut me up! What are you staring at, bespectacled?! Do not joke with me! Do not joke with me! Do you know this woman? She is my worst enemy! No, I don't know her. How about this one? She looks like a cute little girl! Haven't seen this one. So I don't need you! Gotta get off! I will take care of you! I will crush you! Caught! Miyasabi! We thought we were going to die. Then it was very bad. But now. I left the nails in my head as the beginning of a new fashion! I will kill everyone! I don't care who I kill! I don't care who it is! I don't care who it was! I don't care who it was! Are they the yakuza that killed me? Exactly. My wife was also killed by them. They don't care who it is. They kill everyone who gets in their way. That's why they are known as. "Kill All" command. Team Kill All? I have to kill them! Killing innocent civilians... Absolutely unforgivable! I'll take revenge! I will kill them! I will kill them! I will kill them all! Here is the spirit! Yoshie. It will be hard to fight them like this. I will give you strength. I will make you the best! Yes! 178, 179, 180... Excellent! Up to a thousand and continue! Yes! I will try! Get your feet up! Good! Well, how? Painfully! Three more hours! I give up! 275... 277... Get down below! Yes... Are you serious? Yes! I will kill them! I will kill them! I will kill them! What are you slowing down? If you slow down like that, the yakuza will kill you again! Sorry! I've always been bad at physical education! But I must try not to let myself get killed! Painfully! Tokyo Tower stuck in my ass! Painfully! I can't get her out! Painfully! How embarrassing! Painfully! I can't get her out! This girl is unique. She is shy but remains calm. Can this be used in combat somehow? Exactly! Sale of tombstones. We've never met, but I'll attack you! Not! I will sacrifice you! You! Do you want to fight? Of course! Usually people die after such a wound. But I came back from hell as the shyest person in Japan! Shy? Found something to be proud of! And what's good about that? And really nothing! What? Noooo! How embarrassing! What the hell is this!? This is a response to my modesty. This is my shy machine gun! Noooo! Out! How embarrassing! Noo! How embarrassing! Nooooo! How embarrassing! How embarrassing! It's coming out, it's coming out! How embarrassing! Noooo! Don't look! I want to disappear! Surprised? How do you like my new weapon? The more Yoshio gets embarrassed, All the more painful death awaits you! I won't let some shy girl kill me! Let's! Noooo! How embarrassing when a sumo fighter looks at me there! It doesn't even hurt me! What? My machine gun didn't work! Stop doing that! Yoshii! I'll make your wounds hurt even more! Stop, let go. How about warm sake. Only not this! Painfully! My wounds are swelling! Yoshii! Yoshii! Stop! Long time no see! I am Ryuji. What? I didn't think you were still alive. I also miraculously survived! You treated me horribly! Unforgivable! I won't forgive you. I will never forgive! Interesting. Show me your hate! More hate!
