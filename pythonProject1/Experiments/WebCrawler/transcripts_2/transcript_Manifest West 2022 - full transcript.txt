They were looking for a better life. [music continues] The family came from a big city, but then they ran out of money and they had to leave. There was a big sister and a little sister. There was a mom and a dad. They weren't perfect. But they were a family. [indistinct radio chatter] MAN ON RADIO: ...and are throwing in the towel. The indicators are right there. We have the highest unemployment in- and growing segment of the population who are taking out more than they are putting in at a national debt that outweighs our GDP. Folks, we are living in a house of cards. And when the walls come tumbling down... Riley, we can't leave without you. You'd never survive on your own. I would. Oh, yeah? What would you eat? Cereal. There's three boxes in the kitchen. All right, Cap'n Crunch. Let's roll. This is home. No, home is where we're together. Promise? [melancholy music] [car door closing] [engine starts] MARY HAYES: Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom. [Mary neighs and nickers] Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom. DAVE HAYES: How you girls doing back there? After we move, are you going to have a job like before? Not right away. You know, unless I want one. You know why? Because we're going on an adventure. You know adventurers, right? Like a Tarzan. Yeah, sure. Yeah, like a Tarzan. I like the monkeys. [whooping] Mommy... [pensive music] MAN ON RADIO: People out there are pissed off. They've lost homes, businesses, and they're not taking it anymore. The phone lines are blowing up. Let's go to Dennis in Milwaukee. What's up, man? DENNIS ON RADIO: Jerry, look, we're going to talk about what the last caller was saying. I gotta... [song playing over radio] When can I play? Never. Why? Your brain is still little and stupid. Someday it'll grow up and it'll work better. Riley, share with your sister. She doesn't even know how to play. She just wants to press buttons. - Uh, excuse me. - Yeah. Yeah. My husband and I, we split the combo number one, but we didn't get the hash browns since he had chose the hash browns. Yeah, that's just how they do it. All combos are $7.99. Doesn't really matter if you get everything or not. I just don't want to pay for the hash browns. Will you take it off? -Like I said, the- -You know what? I'd love to have the hash browns. Thank you. WAITRESS: Be right out. Mom. Mary! MARY: Mommy, look. It's name is Cookie. Baby, you... you can't do that, okay? I love riding her. She's very pretty. - And I love braiding her hair. - Okay? She comes from Unicorn Land and she's a very rare unicorn. She's very pretty.

[insects chirping] [crow cawing] What is this place? Home. [birds chirping] Pipe wrench. I'll get you. What do you think? Call it a day? I'm not tired. It's because you're not the one on top of the house. First lesson of upper management. Respect union breaks or the workers will strike. [exhales sharply] Thanks, hon. Hey, little monster. Get over here and finish your food. What, you don't like it? Tomatoes are gross. What? No. They're so good. [grunts] When do we go back to school? What if you don't have to? What if you could just stay up here? Kids have to go to school. Okay. Then this is a school. What is? This cabin. It can be a school. It can be whatever you want it to be. - Really? - Mary likes it. If you could learn about anything, what would it be? I like history. Then we'll learn history. Your mom and I, we had two jobs so we could buy groceries that somebody else grew. Send you to school where somebody else taught. And it was backwards. We make the rules now. All four of us. This place, it's just us. It's ours. [birds chirping] [cricket chirps] [squelching] Oh. Mm. Pew. Pew, pew. Pew. Pew. Now what? Nothing. You exploded. When do you explode? I don't. I'm the American. You're the Taliban. Oh, okay. One, two, three. RILEY: When the early pioneers went west, life was hard. Many spent all their money on the trip and had nothing left when they got there. They were everyday Americans who risked everything for an uncertain reward. The frontire was a- Frontier. The I-E-R is like ear. [chuckles] RILEY: The frontier was... ALICE: Well, what do you guys want on the flag? MARY: Can there be stars? ALICE: How many? Four? Why four? Four of us. I like pirates. Like a skull and crossbones? MARY: No, no, no! Your sister is afraid of skeletons. RILEY: You said it could be anything. Anything that doesn't involve skeletons or the undead. Sharks. Sharks we can do. [instrumental music] ALICE: You look like a man with a question. DAVE: What does that look like? Hmm. Pensive, squinty eyes, maybe a little constipated. Really? Are you okay? Better than okay. Do you think this place is good for you? Is it, is it helping? Hmm. I love you. And I love you, too. [birds chirping] [mimics static] Spotted a base command. We have eyes on target. Be advised. He has a weapon. May need air support. Over. [mimics static] [car engine revving] Good afternoon. You got a minute? I'm with Building and Safety. I was up here for an inspection three or four years back. The place was already in foreclosure then but it looked like hell. DAVE: Yeah, I found some spare lumber around the place, you know, fixed what I could. INSPECTOR: Power come off the grid? DAVE: Yep. Hoping to go solar, though. Phone? Uh, old land line hookup. And where's your septic? Uh... over there, I think. Yeah. You smell that? You got a leak. You're gonna need to dig out the tank, patch it, maybe replace. [flies buzzing] Come on. You've got farms in the valley. County considers cross-contamination to be an E. coli risk. Previous owner probably got grandfathered in. I... I got to dig it out myself? You got a winch? - No. - You're going to need a winch. It's bullshit. No, that is your shit running into the county's water table. Fuck's sake! MARY: What do you think they look like? Do you think that they're yellow? You think they're orange? RILEY: How do you not know what a monkey looks like? [Mary whooping] Mary! Mary! Mary! Mary! MARY: She said there weren't, but I think I found one. Have you seen any in the trees? I think they only come out at night. And that's why nobody's seen them. Is she with you? I'm Eric. Riley. Well, Riley, you gonna give her the bad news about the monkeys? Or am I gonna have to be the one? So it's a night before Thanksgiving. We got some family coming into town. So Susie cooks up everything the day before, the bird, mashed potatoes, cornbread, that works. That night I wake up, I hear this crashing coming from downstairs. It's like a marching band's moving in. Now I just figured it was Susie, right? Figured she was putting the last minute touches on the meal. Then I hear this deep, deep grumbling inches from the back of my neck. MARY: Oh. Was it a monster? It was worse. It was Susie snoring. SUSIE LIND: I do not. [mimics snoring] [all laughing] So then I go downstairs, right? The fridge is wide open, and I kid you not, there is this guy gorging his face, going to town on Susie's food. And I'm like, "Hey, buddy, that's our Thanksgiving dinner." DAVE: Well, what did he say? "The neighbor's food was better." He's like, "The neighbor's food was better." "Get the hell out of my house." Yeah. That's when we decided that Tampa wasn't for us. Too many lunatics. Those people should be permanently locked up, as far as I'm concerned. - Bourbon? - ERIC LIND: Oh, yes. Hey, old man. Pour me up a tall one on the rocks. [all chuckling] SUSIE: Have you all seen the bear that's been roaming around here? ERIC: You walk all the way down to the creek. There's a little waterfall, but you- Guns are bad. Well, uh, guns can be bad, but if it's used correctly, it's just a tool, like a screwdriver. MARY: Or like a pipe wrench. That too. I'm sorry if I made anyone feel uncomfortable. I'm used to carrying it everywhere. I'm sorry. Nah. We're a bunch of city folk talking. ALICE: We made a mistake, babe. We're going home. DAVE: The girls are having fun out here. I like it, and I think it's great to be up here. Is Mom okay? DAVE: And we do not have to deal with the real world right now, okay? That is the best for you. We moved up here for you. - You understand that? - She'll be fine. ALICE: We're nothing like these peoples! We're going back... She'll be better in the morning. ALICE: We're going to figure it out. [door closes] Do you think Eric kills people with his gun? Probably. How many? Ten. Really? Yeah. Shot them right in the head. I mean, their brains explode like spaghetti. I don't think he kills anyone. [instrumental music] You can fix it, right? Yeah. Motherfucker! Fucking winch! Where am I going to find a fucking winch? ERIC: Remember what we talked about. You take a breath. Exhale slowly. And whenever you're ready. Ha-ha! Nice shot. You're a natural. Look, uh, it's none of my business, so you just tell me to fuck right off if I'm overstepping. Is Alice okay with her being out here? Yeah. Yeah, she's okay. She's... she's fine. Alice is bipolar. A year ago, she was teaching elementary school and... she had an episode and she thought a student was somebody they weren't. And it was pretty bad. She... She just needs some time off. Get some rest. Get her mind right. I mean, they put her on this medication and it helps for a while, but she always gets worse. But up here, she seems good. You know? I think this is a really good place for her. She's happy. We're happy. [crickets chirping] [birds chirping] Chin up. You'll be a family of mountain men in no time. Pioneers. DAVE: Yeah. We have all the help we can get. Do you have a winch? -Sweetheart, don't bother- -I don't. But I might know someone who does. I... I may need a favor. [upbeat music] All right. How does it look? Is it tight? - DAVE: Yep. - Okay. I figure you can plug that leak with a can of sealer and drop it in the ground up there. Mr. Danik, I can't say how much... Oh, Mr. Danik? Mr. Danik's my dad. Come on, Steve, man. - All right, Steve. - We're neighbors. Yeah. You'd do the same thing for me, right? Yeah, of course. You're a real badass motherfucker, aren't you? You're the real deal. We're a dying breed up here. Hey, Lana, you want to operate the winch. Wait. Seriously? Hell no. He's not serious. Come on. You want a beer? - Yeah. - Let's go. RUTH: Squeeze the trigger. Don't yank it. All right. Then what? It's going to kick you in the shoulders, so keep it tight. Kick? You're going to want to keep... keep it right... keep the butt right up in there. ALICE: All right. Yeah. Oh! That hurts. You got something that doesn't rip your arm off? That thing's got more recoil than a 12-gauge. So it'll be smooth sailing after this. Gave our daughter one when she turned seven. Dumbass kid shot right next to her brother's head. Still can't hear us half the time. [gunshot] LANA: What did your dad do? He used to work at a mine, but he got fired. Now? I don't know, he's like a farmer, I think. That's pretty good. My family's rich as shit. We just live up here because we like hunting and fishing. Could probably even live in Beverly Hills if we wanted. Have a pool or something. We used to have a pool. I'm talking about a real pool. Not your family's weak-ass pool. Should we go back? You scared? I'm trying to show you the big dog shit. You a big dog? I think so. Good. [birds chirping] Cool place. Yeah, it's pretty sweet. Thinking about putting an ice machine in over there for the summer. What do you do in here? Adult shit. You're clinging it! Be careful with the pages. Okay? Okay. I drink my dad's beer sometimes. We should go back. Why? I think I may be heard somebody yelling, so we should go back. If you didn't want to hang out with me, you should've just said so. It's just... I... I don't want to drink it. I thought we could be friends. We can. Drink it. You gotta drink! Drink it! Hey! Get back here! You said you're a big dog. [panting] I'm sorry I didn't do that. I didn't do that, okay? DAVE: Riley! - Okay? - STEVE DANIK: Hey, what's up? - What's going on? - Riley. - Are you okay? Yeah? - LANA DANIK: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to. It was an accident. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. You shouldn't move. You shouldn't move. It's okay. Let me take care of her. I just want to see you. I just want you to move for me. Just move it. How's that? Yeah, it hurts a little? Okay. All right. Well, you know what? Looks like you wrenched a little bit, but I think you're going to live. Riley. What's going on? What happened? Mom. Oh, God. Are you okay? Oh, baby. LANA: I'm sorry, it was an accident. It was an accident. What did she do to you? Why would she hurt you? It's okay. ALICE: What did you do to her? I'm sorry. It was an accident. We were just playing. This is not playing. What did you do? I'm sorry, it was an accident. I'm sorry. What did you do? What did you do? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Honey, honey, honey, honey. Honey, honey. Honey, cut it out. Honey. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Hey, look at me. Look at me. It's okay. It's okay. Look, she's okay. All right. Look at her. - LANA: I'm so sorry. - She's okay. Look at me. LANA: I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it. [Lana sobbing] - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Hey, stop crying! Okay? Enough. Sorry this happened. Yeah. We'll make it up to you somehow. And she's going to be... it's going to be okay, so. It's okay. She's okay. - She's not okay. - She's okay. Look at her. - She's fine. - She's not okay. Come on. Riley, let's go. RILEY: Mom is sick. MARY: Like a cold? RILEY: She got like this before. You don't remember. MARY: I remember. Dad took her to the doctor. Then she was Mom again. RILEY: I don't think Dad's going to take her to the doctor this time. It's different than before. MARY: Is Dad sick too? RILEY: No. Just different. ALICE: And I feel like it's been so long. When was the last time that... that I saw you? My kids are older now. You have to see them before you go. You just don't know where they go off to. Hmm. MARY: I'm here. You know, the kids. They're growing up so fast. You just turn around one day and boom, they're little people. It's me. I'm here. Mary? I thought... Of course it's you. Of course it's you. I'm so sorry, babe. That's okay. [rock music] [indistinct chatter] I built this shit myself. This is my only child. This is my only child. Fuck those other kids. This is a serious motherfucking weapon of war right here, buddy. [indistinct chatter] No. [groans] It's pretty cool that your parents let you hang out late. Push the sides in, dumb fuck. I brought the spray. Trying to get fucked up or what? You going in? Yeah. I will. Hey, I'll beat your ass. JAY: Take it easy. We're just fucking around. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Are you serious? What? Huffing, that's old school. Best high is to take it direct, the rag just dilutes it. Everyone knows that. - JAY: Since when? - Since always. Look, you want to get blasted, ditch the rag and stick it right in here. Fine, man. If you're too much of a pussy, let daddy do it for you. Fuck off! [all laughing] JAY: Fuck you, man! Fuck you! RICK: You're so stupid. RILEY: Dad. Is Mom okay? Yeah, Mom's fine. She's just tired. You know how she gets when she's tired. It's not easy taking care of everyone all the time. Should she go to a doctor? Mom doesn't need a doctor. She just needs rest. She'll be good, I promise you. Mom? Mom? When they got here, they were over 500 native tribes already in the United States. But as white settlers moved west, violence increased between these newcomers and the local tribes. In 1800, the Indian population of the United States was roughly 600,000. But by 1890, it had dropped to only 250,000. MARY: Where did they go? They died. Why? We killed them. Riley, your sister doesn't- It's true. Your sister doesn't like that. The remaining Indian tribes had the lands taken from them and were forced onto reservations where thousands more died of starvation and- Riley. Why did they kill them? Mom. [sighs] Riley. Did you take out one of these pages? It's okay if you did. You can tell me the truth. No more school today. [water trickling] You look cool. Really?

In the past, adults used to dress in shitty - and kids... [music stops] [crickets chirping] Mom, I need a shirt. They're in the washing machine. We don't have a washing machine. That was at the old house. What are you talking about? Never mind. I'm sorry. [birds chirping] What are you doing? Being a worm. That's fucking stupid. Let's go, dear both. MARY: Where's Mom? She's not coming. MARY: How do you know? Hardware? Down on 12th. - What are you doing? - OShut up. Riley! - Give it. - Hey, let go. No! Mom would let me have it. Mom's not here! Hey. Is everything cool back here? Riley won't share. Looks like there's enough to go around. Share with your sister. It's on me. So, haven't seen you two before. We live on the mountain. The mountain. That sounds like fun. Yeah, sometimes it's boring. There aren't any other kids except for this one girl, but she hurt Riley. Are you okay? My mom hit the other girl right in the face. Mary. Everyone's okay. My mom didn't hurt anybody. My mom is scary sometimes. Shut up! When I was your age, my parents would fight. And it was scary. And sometimes they would hit people, too. Does your Mom hurt you? You can talk to me. It's fine. We need to go. Mary, let's go. It's okay to ask for help. What the fuck do you think you're doing? Get away from them. We were talking about Mom. Girls, in the car. -MARY: But we were- -Now! What did you tell her about your mom? RILEY: I didn't tell her anything. [tires screeching] [instrumental music] STEVE: It's like Reagan, man. Remember Reagan? He said, "Be as a shining city on the hill." Right? And he fucking got that shit from the Bible. But he said it best. God, fucking badass. City on a hill, I like that. - You're on it. - Yeah. We're the shining city on the hill, right? That's us, dude. That's fucking us. - That's what we're doing. - Yeah. And they don't fucking get it. - Yeah. Who? - Huh? Who? The fucking uptight elites. Wait. Are you fucking listening to me? You gotta fucking breathe. [pensive music] [Alice sobbing] [glass shatters] [Alice sobbing] I'm sorry. I don't know what's happening to me. Oh, baby. I need a doctor. Hey, who's going to pay for that? I mean, this place is good for you. Now, you said you were good here. You said it was helping. [Alice sobbing] [bird chirping] What are you guys doing? Are your parents home? - Can I help you? - Mr. Hayes. I'm Loraine Miller. I'm with the Department of Child and Family Services. Okay. We've received a child welfare report for your family. A report from who? May we come in? And do either of you have a criminal record? No. Do you discipline your children? No. I mean, yes. I mean, if they're bad, but we don't hit them. I mean, are you asking if we hit our children? These are just standard questions. If your children are injured, do you have contingencies in place for their medical care? Yeah. We have a first aid kit. May I see it? Sure. Do you have a copy of your children's current school records? Uh, we home school our children. My wife's a teacher, professionally. Oh, you're licensed? Yeah, she's credentialed in California. I'm sorry, sir. I'd like her to answer, if that's all right. Ma'am. I was credentialed with the California Board of Education, but that lapsed during a leave of absence. I do still have my early childhood credential, though. Would you like to see it? That would be helpful. Quite a few families up here home school. Normally, though, we have standardized reporting and benchmarks that we expect parents to provide annually. Hmm. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Found it. Okay. I'm going to need to speak to your children in private. Is there somewhere we can do that? And what's this a picture of? A turtle with no shell. Hmm. That's very creative. You need to know that it's okay to be honest with me. Are we in trouble? Nobody's in trouble. Then, why are you here? I'm here to help. That's it. What does that mean? It means that I'm here to do whatever I can to help your parents make this the best home for you that it can possibly be. Have you helped lots of people? LORAINE MILLER: I have. Riley. Is there something you need to tell me? Does it always take this long? Can I speak to you outside? What did you guys talk about? What did she say? She's going to help. How is she going to help? Riley! She's going to help mom. Riley, whatever you told her, you have to tell her that it's a lie. Do you understand me? - It wasn't. - I don't care! Mr. and Mrs. Hayes, based on observable evidence in your home, I believe it's in the best interest of the children to be placed into the care of DCFS while we complete a further investigation. No. No way. You said you would help my mom. She said she would help mom. DAVE: Whatever my daughter told you is not true. Please, I don't understand, can we just sit down? We can just, we can just sit down. Come on. Calm down, ma'am. Calm down. Calm down. Have a seat. Please, have a seat. Hey, enough. Step away from my wife. Why do I have to go? You said you would help my mom. - I'm not a kid! - It's okay, Riley. Don't talk to me like I'm a little kid. - Calm down. - Same team, remember? We're not. You lied, you're a liar. You said you would help my mom. You can't do this. Riley! Hey. You can't do this. [intense music] Riley! [music intensifies] [crickets chirping] MAN ON TV: Welcome back to the game. SUSIE: It's okay. Hold still. Okay. There. All done. [indistinct chatter over TV] You know you're gonna have to go soon? I know. [siren wails] [alarm ringing] Riley. You're gonna be late. Come on, get up. Let's go. MARY: Mama Carol says we can go to the good park this weekend. Stop calling her that. She's just taking care of us until we go back home. Hey. Cool shirt. Thanks. What'd you bring for lunch? Mm-mmm. I don't know. Want to trade? Okay. Thanks. [girls giggling] She didn't give you her lunch. [instrumental music] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday ♪ No, I know. I'm gonna call you right back.

Riley, get over here. ♪ Happy birthday to you, Riley ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ What do you think Mom and Dad are doing right now? They'll be at the house. Do you think they'll visit?

Hey! Oh. It's good to see you. What, no hug for your old man? That's okay. Whoo, heck of a grip. Hey, what happened to your eye? There was an incident. Someone hurt you? She got into a fight with some other girls at school. Hey, who wants pizza, huh? MARY: Is Mommy coming? No. Mom couldn't make it. But she told me to tell you that she loves you both very much. What's the matter? You don't eat your crust anymore. When did that happen? Come on, crust builds character. Oh, it's terrible. Warned you. Oh, it speaks. How is school? I had to go to a new one. A new school, when? It's on the same campus. DAVE: I... don't understand. Riley is enrolled in a satellite program for children who need some extra academic support. That's for stupid kids. Riley, you're not stupid. This doesn't make any sense. I mean, she's a great reader. She loves school. [phone chiming] What is this? Medicine. For what? My brain. It's generic methylphenidate. She's on a relatively low dosage. Mary was diagnosed with ADHD. She's just a little kid. She has a personality. You have to get our permission for that, don't you? LORAINE: Parental consent wasn't required in this case. The foster family and DCFS felt it was the right choice. Hey. Baby, does this stuff help you? If they say you have to take it, then you have to take it, okay? Okay. If you'll excuse me, I have to use the restroom. Maybe you should start wrapping up. [Dave sighs] Hey, I've got a present for you. What is it? It's... it's in the car. You wanna go see it? Should we wait for Loraine? Let's not. We left my medicine. You don't need those, okay? You're perfect exactly the way you are. Come on. Okay. Come on, get in the car. Where's the present? Uh, I forgot it at home. Come on, we have to go. RILEY: Dad? Dad? - You should write a note. - What? Next time before you leave the house, you should write a note, so you don't forget my present. - RILEY: Dad! - Good idea. What? Can I ride at front? ♪ I've beenolding it in since I clockedn Monday morning ♪ ♪ Come the end of the week I'm about-to -blow ♪ [intense music] DAVE: Are you guys ready? - Yeah. - Let's do it. [whispering] Who let the farts out? It was who let the frogs out. - MARY: It's not what Dad said. - DAVE: I like mine better. Shouldn't you be gone all ready? DAVE: Where? Doing your work today. DAVE: Uh, it's... it's Sunday. I thought we could bum around with the kids. Hmm. I'm not just gonna let you watch Sponge Bob all day. RILEY: I have homework. Homework? I'm gonna have a talk with your teacher. The way she loads you up. I know she doesn't grade any of it. -MARY: You don't have- -RILEY: No, it's fine. I don't want to do it. DAVE: What can I say? She's... she's a hard worker. Hmm. Who's hungry? You don't have any homework. Shut up. Pretend. MARY: This is stupid! DAVE: Mary, quiet. Don't set her off again. Why are we pretending we're in our old house? We're not in our old house. Dave. Where's the food? I thought we bought food. [Alice breathing heavily] DAVE: Alice. [helicopter whirring] It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. [indistinct yelling] They're gonna come inside. Honey, honey, they're gonna come inside, okay? OFFICER: Mr. Dave, your house is surrounded. DAVE: Alice, look at me, as long as the kids are here, they won't come in. ALICE: You lied to me. OFFICER: We have a medical chop on standby. You need to communicate with us. [indistinct radio chatter] [mimics static] Spider to command, do you copy? Looks like we got some heavy manpower out here. Probably got a fucking rocket launcher or something. [mimics static] [indistinct radio chatter] OFFICER: Mr. Hayes, this is going to end. You do not control that. Think about your family. [melancholy music] MARY: Why do they do this every night? RILEY: So we can't sleep. They want us to leave. Mary. - What? - Drums or guitar? Come on, gotta think fast, drums or guitar? Oh, guitar. All right, cool. [heavy metal music] [birds chirping] Hey, take it easy. Ow! Hey, that hurts. Mama Carol says they have to do it tight so I don't look like a slob. Mama Carol called you a slob? Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Mama Carol sounds like a bitch. [Mary giggling] [somber music] [birds chirping] [indistinct radio chatter] How about that drink you wanted? For real? Yeah, sure. Why not? Whoa, whoa, whoa. We gotta cheers to something. Make it official. Pioneers? Yeah, sure. Pioneers. [coughs] Does it taste better when you're older? Nah. You just get better at drinking it. Do you have a plan? No. I like this, though. What? Being together again. Yeah. Me too. [heavy metal music] [melancholy music] [helicopter whirring] MARY: Is there food? ON PHONE: 911 operator. Hey, can I get a two meatball subs, toasted turkey sandwich and a salami sandwich? Dad. No, no lettuce on the salami, please. OPERATOR: Is this a joke? No, it's not a joke. I don't have a phone book and my kids are hungry. OPERATOR: Sir, this is - we don't deliver sandwiches. Well, why don't you tell one of your guys parked outside of my house to go get one? OPERATOR: Who am I speaking with? This is Dave Hayes. [car approaching] [footsteps approaching] [knocks at door] Drop it at the door. I'm not fucking around. You're gonna let me in or what? So you just took the kids and walked right out the door? Pretty much. And then you... you came back here. Yeah, well, we weren't doing too well without them here. Hmm. Kids belong with their parents. Sheriff gave a press conference. Said you opened fire on a cruiser when they pulled up. I hadn't fired a shot in the air. That's about it. Well, I'm personally willing to testify under oath you couldn't hit shit if you tried. That being said, he had a driveway full of cops who don't know you as well as I do. Danik's protesting the police, made signs and everything. He got the whole family camped out at the turnout. Personally, I think Steve likes being on TV. God bless him. So we're the Danik clan's last stand, huh? Well, you're going to die on a cross, make it a big one. I don't know how big we are. Don't tell that to the news crews. They got these people on little boxes talking about your six, seven, eight on screen at once. Are any of them on our team? Mostly just the assholes. Well, us assholes are a proud people. We have to stick together. What'd you learn from this? Like I said, kids belong with their parents. No, I mean, from all of it, this... this place. Man, I thought it'd be nice not to be part of the world anymore. What do you got against the world? It had something against us. You know, this is the world, right? You're still in it, buddy. All he did was move to the top of a mountain. Can you help us? Can you talk to them? Tell them that we're good people. When I was in the Corps, during basic, they put us in a room and tossed in percussion grenades. It was fast. You go blind. The shock wave wrecks your inner ear so you can't stand. I saw grown men puking their guts out till nothing but bile came out. What do you think one of those grenades will do to a child? What do we do? Let me walk out with the kids, today. Whose side are you on? They're coming in, Dave. I don't know when, but this will end. But you... What, you're trying to take my family away from me? You need to end this right. - You need to leave. - No, not yet. Dave, stop. Riley, Dad. Baby. He's right. What are you fucking talking about? What do you mean? You don't ever want to see our kids again? - Is that what you want? - Dave, stop. You think I'm some sort of fucking joke, huh? This is my house! - [gunshot] - Ahh! OFFICER: Shots fired, shots fired. - Get out! - [gunshot] - Find a safe place to hide. - Don't talk to my fucking kids. - Girls, upstairs. - ALICE: Dave. - Get out of my fucking house! - Okay. Get out! Stay back. Stay back from the door. DAVE: Move! Get the fuck out of my house, Eric. Argh! Fuck you! Dad. Oh, jeez! No. Alice. Hey, no, don't go, don't go, don't go. Stay with me. Stay with me. Do you understand? Girls, come here. Keep pressure on her. Mommy. Please. Please, please. Keep pressure on it. You don't need me anymore. You're all grown up now. Promise me that you won't leave. Promise! Promise! Promise. [intense music] DAVE: Get out of the way, get out of the way, move, move. Hon, you're okay, you're okay. Riley, anything that comes through that door, you shoot it. Do you understand me? Do you understand me? Honey, honey, honey, honey. Honey. Stay with me, okay? Just stay with me. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're gonna be okay. I promise you. OFFICER: Mr. Hayes, is everyone inside okay? You shot my wife! Fuck you! Fuck you! OFFICER: Hold your fire. Hold your fucking fire. Why can't you just leave us alone? We just want to be left alone! It's all we ever wanted! Fuck you! [gun firing] Dad! We just want to be left alone. That's it. - Why can't you do that? - Dad! Dad! What? Stop! You want to see your mom die? They did this to her. They shot her. They're going to come in here and take her away from me. No. Now you shut up and listen to me. No, you listen. You don't ever listen. All Mom ever needed was help. They didn't do this to her. You did. [groaning] [sobbing] We'll never be a family again. This isn't home anymore. It hasn't been for a really long time. But this place doesn't make us a family. It never did. I'm sorry. [melancholy music] RILEY: Once there was a family of pioneers, who were looking for a better life. There was a big sister and a little sister. There was a mom and a dad. They made lots of mistakes, but they tried their best. They had a house on top of a mountain. And they laughed and fished and grew their own vegetables. [melancholy music] Most of the time they were happy... except for the parts that were sad.
