foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Vasiliki, darling… Mom, how are you feeling? The same... ...weak. I feel this bloody medication all over my body. Vasiliki darling... could you play that tune for me on the piano... ...the one I really like. You know... Yeah, sure, mom. Thank you... My darling, I can't leave the house... like that. When I finish, around five, I will come over to give you the shot. It’s all right, I already took care of that. But I would like something else. I need you to bring me that turban... the one I gave you last year... The blue one, that I brought from Barcelona. Yes, mum…But, what do you want to do with it? I want to wear it when I go out. All right, then. I lost more hair. I see… Listen... I'm not going to make a big deal because of less hair, am I? Okay, mum. You really messed up, Dimitris. I did what I had to do. No, that’s not what we agreed upon! - What’s done, is done. - It shouldn't have been done. - My intentions were clear from the start. - But, that's not what we agreed upon, Dimitris. It’s already done. There is nothing else to do but wait. You mean, I have to wait? You’re going away. There’s nothing else I can do man. I’ll do my best to get back soon. Do whatever you have to do and get back quickly, okay? Take care, dude… Hi mom… - Did you get back okay? - Yes I did. How was it? Did it hurt? No honey, the IV doesn’t hurt. But I got really bored waiting for the drip. Okay mom. Now you must be extra careful. Don’t go fishing again. It’s getting cold outside. I’ll check the sea first. You better stay put. I mean, you won’t be reeling in any big ones anyway. Vassiliki, there is no reason for me to live my life differently, all of the sudden. My name is Panayota Lambrinou We spoke last night... You told me... Can I call you by your first name? Of course... When we spoke last night I felt... ...I felt some kind of intimacy. I felt that I am not alone That's why I called you again. I wanted to give you another perspective... Cancer doesn't always kill you. You can survive it. Have you ever thought of speaking to a professional about your feelings? No, I never thought about it. I've never been to a psychologist... I always considered myself strong enough to deal with anything... They are loading it... Should I tell him that? No, I haven’t talked to him yet… …in a minute. Right. OK, I’ll tell him, bye. With this lot it amounts to over 130,000. - What are you saying, Manos? - You heard me. Just the photocopy machines, the computers, the servers... are worth at least 60.000. So what are you saying? You 'll try to sell them yourself, on e-bay? Manos, I’ll be in the van. So, what are we doing? Are you saying you don't have it? No, Manos. I don’t have that much money, man... So? - When do you need it by? - Yesterday. What are you going to do? I’ve put my house on the market... I’ll go to Skydra to sell some of my land... Here, take these as well. They are worth something. What’s this, dude? You think I run some kind of nickel and dime store? The yard is full of cars owned by jerks like you. How do I manage to get involved in this kind of shit! One jumps from the third floor, another offers me his wife instead of cash. You don’t want to end up like them, buddy. I’ll check with everybody else and let you know. Take care, man. Good morning. Cut the crap. I was waiting for you all day Saturday. The loan sharks took everything There is nothing left. You wouldn't believe it, man. What?... I bet you were checking out some new software, all night. Yeah, right, the "Athens by night" software. I see... a chick then. Not a chick, man. Hassan... One of those poor guys who clean windshields at the traffic lights... ...was hit by a bastard driving a Mercedes and... we took him to the hospital... we stayed until 6:00 am. Why did you get involved? The poor guy comes from Syria. He has no papers, you get the idea. I get it... St. Nickolas, protector of sailors, is now protector of immigrants, as well. What else could I do, Dimitris? Everybody was just standing there staring ... ...at him as if it were some kind of street show. How did you do? What do you think? These guys take the shirt off your back and then, they want your kidney, too. Fuck, man. Let’s go, we have to talk. I’ve got a job for you. What kind of a job? I want you to check on a few mobile phone antennas in Glyfada. Nikos, no way man... Come on, I know you are not into that stuff any longer. Precisely. I don't want to deal with radiation. I did it for years. Get someone else. Dimitris, it’s a one-day job. I am asking you, do it as a personal favor. - A favour to you or to the company? - To me. - I am serious. - Who's paying? Petros. It better be a lot and right away. I really need the money. He’ll pay you double what you normally get. How come? Some hacker is listening in. It's not the first time! A harbormaster is probably being blackmailed for a place in a marina, or an actor or a singer. No, this time it looks pretty serious. Over thirty phone lines are being hacked. It's too big. There is way too much money poured into this. It's not like the last time. I think this might be big. Look, there is one here, another one there, and the last one here What did you do with the house? I’ve put it on the market and started moving my stuff out. If it sells quickly I might get away clean. It's been five months that I’ve been telling you about this hacking. Our lines have been hacked. I don’t know what else to do. So, what do you suggest we do? We should collaborate with the police and catch them red-handed. Well, I’ll have to consult with our legal department before making any decision. Carry on with the investigation and I’ll let you know. Dimitris, how are you doing? Marvelous. Like everybody else. Our door is always open for you. Make sure I get paid for this job and we’ll talk about it again. Nikos, come see me as soon as you’re done with this. We’ll sort it out. This rooftop is clear - Look. - Yeah. And I didn't find anything on this one either. - The servers seem to be clean. - Yeah! Now look at this. I haven't seen this in a long time. Since your days I thought they had stopped installing them in apartments. I don't know 15,000 Euros a year rent for an antenna is pretty good money. It's easier to hack from an apartment, than from a roof-top. You don't have to cover them within water tanks, or chimneys In an apartment, you are less visible. It must be this one. Hello, sweetheart… I don’t know, I don't know what to say... I have to start chemotherapy right away... Maybe the day after tomorrow, If there’s a spot available... I don't know. At least I have no family history. Listen, I need to get in the elevator. Yes, yes, I’m waiting for you. Good afternoon Hi sweetheart.. Tell me all about it. I can’t wait. Oh mom, I really saw it this time. Its head was turned and I could see how much the baby has grown. And its heart? Tell me again what its heartbeat sounds like! Tok tok, tok tok, tok tok like a horse, mom... Really loud. My little girl is having a baby. I still haven’t fully realized it. Me neither! Hi, it’s me. Hi Despina... I' m going to throw this phone out of the window. Those phones you have at home need to go to a museum. Listen, next month I have a few days off and I was thinking of coming down to Athens. Do you want to go to the theater? A theater date with you would be perfect! You can’t imagine how much I’ve missed it. How are you? Some days the medication makes me feel better, and some days I feel horrible. ...nights are the worst. How are things up here? Terrible! And down there? Don't even ask! Worse than here? I went by the waterfall today. Did you miss it? I had some ideas. What kind of ideas? Political? I trust you. But, it would end one day anyway. Say it’s over. Back to square one. Back to the start. You know something, Dimitris? You remind me of a wild duck. Why is that dude? Ducks live a quiet life, don’t hurt anyone, mind their own business. And then the hunting season starts... they hide in the reeds. But even after the season is over people keep hunting and killing them illegally. You saw those wires right? Someone has tapped into the server. We need to check the server rack. I 'm done, man. My job is done. I don’t give a fuck about the phone-hacking. All I care about is getting rid of that antenna. Dimitris, we can’t do that. First, it will raise suspicions, and second, we ’ll never find out who did it. What about all the people who live there, that woman upstairs? Don’t you care about them? What are you talking about, man? I am not the company. I’m just doing my job. I didn't put the damned antenna up, okay? And we don’t even know if the woman got sick because of it. This is what we’ll do. We’ll disconnect the transmitter of the antenna and we 'll wait for their reaction. If the hacking is happening there, they'll come to fix it quickly. If not, we’ll search somewhere else. I don’t know, Dimitris. It's too much, to take the antenna down. Vasiliki, darling… Mom, how are you feeling? The same... ...weak. I feel this bloody medication all over. When I finish, around five, I’ll come over for your shot. Mother... Mother... Oh, my boy! I can’t believe this… What a great surprise, son! Did you visit your sister? I went by outside. But I dream of her a lot. Great apples… Where are they from? From that lot of land, you want to sell. Not only apples. Pears, peaches, apricots, cherries... you can get anything you need all year round … And you want to sell it…what can I say, son. I’m really sorry, Dimitris. Try to be a bit more patient. Things will change. There is hope. Don’t just sell everything. Any buyer will take advantage of you... ...by giving you only 30% of its value. - All right. Thank you. - Take care. You, too. - See you around. - Hope so. And remember what I told you... be patient. In any case, that’s what we’re all doing. Hi, where are you? At home. Still there? How come? I can’t get up, sweetheart. My feet are hurting. I couldn’t sleep last night... there was so much noise from the apartment below. Isn’t it empty? Yes, it was empty. They must have finally rented it again. Fine. I’ll come over to give you a hand. Okay. I’ll be waiting. Hi, it’s me. They reconnected the antenna. I overheard the woman that lives in the upstairs apartment speaking with her daughter. I have the report. It happened at 3 a.m. We are on the right track. I don’t know if we’re on the right track... I think you need to split. Finish what you’re doing, and get out of there. Nikos, this smells like an inside job. I’m pretty sure someone on the inside is doing this. We see. I will chase them like rats. Chill out man. I’ll be back soon. - Did you sell anything? - Nothing at all... Agriculture is not for you. Come back here, we ve got lots to do. Okay, be careful. See you. - Welcome my nephew - Hi Kostas. - Welcome. What can I do with all this land, Kostas? I have no idea how these things work. I was hoping to sell... to pay Manos what I owe him... at least part of it.... you could help a little... I was hoping to manage. You are not going to get any money. If that was a solution to your problem, I would say, go ahead... If you sell it and you don't solve your problem, you will lose it. So, it's better not to sell it. Did Petros fire you? He called me into his office and... ...said that there was nothing he could do... ...that he was sorry and all that crap. And no mention was made of the antenna, right? They said that they will disconnect it and inform the authorities. Which means? Which means a cover up, don’t you get it? What are they going to tell the police? “We have a case of phone-hacking and we’re here to let you know”? Of course not. They’ll say, "We found what we found, come and see for yourselves, but you need to cover it up for us." And how will they disconnect it? They’ll try to bluff their way out by saying... "If you don’t hush this up, consider the hacking incident over." Big bosses never take phone hacking personally.. When did it happen? What? When did he fire you? You didn’t do anything stupid with the antenna, did you? Dimitris, you’ll either save me or burn me! Sorry, man. Now they are doing damage control. Since the case is out in the open, they’re trying to bury it. And the scapegoat is most likely me. All I can say, dude... ...is that we got the kind of hacking, that we deserved. Somebody set up a little shop within the company and is selling services. I was naïve enough to think this wouldn’t damage me. No problem man, we will start over. To a new beginning. We all knew that someone wasn't protecting our network properly. Nikos is too honest, he took it personally. Whereas you, are mature enough not to take this phone-hacking personally. Of course. You count on the fact that the hacker is too skilled to get caught. Listen, Dimitris... ...I thought you were more clever. As soon as the company found out about the hacking, ...we informed the police. Why do you pretend to be panic-stricken when you’re not? We looked at the case both technically and legally. Shall I remind you of the contract you signed? All right, Petros As long as you know that I don’t give a damn about your hacking or your blackmail. All I care about is... ...that those innocent people, …go to sleep feeling they are safe. Please return your keys as soon as you’re done with them. The engineers will need them. Okay? We build installations, we put them in parks, on mountain tops, not inside apartments! If you have some spare time, come give us a hand. - Good evening. - Good evening. Do you have an appointment with Mr Michalis? - Yes. - Come in. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Hello, Panayota. - Hello, Michalis. - Come in. - Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. Do you mind if I fish here, too? No, not at all. It’s just that my line has drifted that way… Be careful. Do I know you from somewhere? Yes, from Be Strong. Oh, right. Do you come fishing often? Now and then, to pass the time. Time passes... for sure What bait do you use? Worms. There are only rocks, here. The best bait is bread. I’ll give you some. Here - Thank you. - You are welcome. That's the best bait. I've been fishing for years... It's when I am happiest... My husband was a fishing fanatic... He used to take me with him... At the beginning, I was bored. He had me hold a fishing pole and little by little I became like him. Now... come here to fish every day... when the weather is good... I come here... It's like meditation..., you'll see... Perfect... Make sure it's taut... and if you get tired, set it on the table. That’s what it’s there for. Is that how you do it? I don't. I bring a chair, I can't stand for long. It's nice here isn't it? Dimitris. Panayota. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. And, no worms next time. Just bread. Definitely. - What’s up, Chris? - Hello, Dimitris. - I’ve got something for you. One of each. There you go. Here is your payment… ...with a little bonus. Before I forget.. l'll return them to the engineers. It should be eighty thousand, with what Kostas gave me. The rest... soon Kostas was right about you. He was right about you, too. In ’68 my old man needed... money. He went to your father. He asked him for 1,500 drachma. Your dad gave him two and a half thousand and told him, "Pay me back whenever you have it". Whenever you have it, the whole amount. - Hi girls - How are you? How is Vassiliki doing? Fine, fine she is getting bigger every day. Give her our best. I followed your advice, only bread. Well done. As far as I can see... ...you are doing well. Any skill you learn these days might be useful. Sorry I’m a bit down today. My phone is getting on my nerves. How is it going with Be Strong? Fine. What brought you there? My sister… How is she? I’m sorry. So, you are unemployed, right? And what line of work were you in? Telephones, telecommunications, that sort of thing. Can you check my phone, then? It hasn’t been working right for about a week now. It keeps making these weird sounds… Who should I call? I can have a look if you want. Really? When? Hi! Thank you for coming. No problem. Come on in. Nice apartment. Yes, I’m very lucky… My parents with my daughter... in Sifnos. This apartment is all we’ve got my husband and I after years of hard work. Come and see the view…. Look, look… you can see all the way to Aigina. Beautiful. I thank God for this view when I wake up every morning. - So, coffee or tea? - Tea. Tea, it will be, then. - Where is the telephone? - There it is. - Do you have another phone? - Yes, in the bedroom. - Sugar? - No Thanks. Pick it up to see if it’s okay. Great, perfect. A man is always useful around the house. It wasn’t anything difficult. Have a seat. We go fishing over there, see? A few steps away. - So, how are you? - I m fine... I want to tell you something. A while ago, a friend asked me to do a job for him as a favor... the job he gave me, brought me here, to your apartment building. This isn’t the first time I've come here. While looking around, I discovered that.. In apartment 12, the one below yours there is a mobile phone transmitter antenna I switched it off twice but they put it back on again... so I really can't do more on my own.. I am not entirely sure... but I think that the antenna may have caused what has happened to you. I could help, if you and the rest of the people who live here, ...do something about it. I can't think of anything else. Where is the antenna. I want to see it... Right now? We fought against having this antenna on our roof, ...and that prick did it behind our backs. I remember there used to be a closet here. The kids were playing hide and seek. - Where, here? - Yes. No, it wasn’t just that. It was deeper. What is this Dimitris? Come on in. - Where is it? - In there. Hello, good morning. I am Nikos. Panayota. Nice to meet you. Dimitris talked to me about you. Yes, I know. Come and see here. I also found this. - Come in, Mr. Stefanos, come and see. - What’s going on? Look , you see? - What a dreadful thing to do. - Can you believe this prick? He put it in here! We will all get sick... - Come in. - Hello, Panayota. - Good evening, how are you? - Fine, fine, Mrs Vergou, come on in, have a look. - Come in. - Hello, Panayota. - Good evening, how are you? - Fine, fine, Mrs Vergou, come on in, have a look. My friends look at the horrible things that are happening in our building. - Come on in. - Have a look, guys. Instead of putting it on the roof, since we didn’t let them… Terrible! They’re willing to kill us for money. - Tell me. - 22... - 74... - Yes. 964. Attention. The elevator is out of order. - Tell me. - A bit to the right. Dimitris… they just arrived. Niko, get ready. They are walking up. Vasiliki darling... Could you play that tune for me on the piano... ...the one I really like, you know.
