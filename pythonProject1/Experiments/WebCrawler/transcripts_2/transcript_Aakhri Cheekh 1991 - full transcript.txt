Lawyer sir, there is double happiness in our life. At first we used to be all four friends. But from today onwards have become business partner. Then there shouldn't be any problem.

Great! That's excellent! Yes brother, childhood friends. Went to school together,& collage together. Start a job together. Marriage! No. Anand got Married first. - Now I am a father of two child also. You are right. Now Jeet is remaining. By becoming biologically Celibate? Now get married. Yes, I think that now I should do it. No excuses will work now. Like, become something or earn something. Company is started now, earning will also get started. Yes. Then tell, do you like any girl? I will go and ask her. Or else should I find a new one for you? Yes, bring a new comer. - Well... when there will be need of marriage certificate... you know whom to look for, I will be there. Oh, yes sir. - All the best! All the best to you all. Thank you, bye, bye. - Thank you, Vijay. Understood, something. - What? Wedding talks are going on. That is why he is shying. That means, he loves your sister Meeta. Jeet, you just say yes for the marriage. And leave all other things on me. I know that when Rahul is not at home... then why you come and call again and again. Now, Priya there is nothing like that... I just call for work. - Shut up. Rahul, listen, should we tell Meeta about the Jeet. - Why not. Meeta, Meeta. There is very good news for you, come down. I think your dear sister has not come home till now. Wow! My dear sister. If Meeta don't come before 8o'clock... then she becomes my dear sister. And if wins in competitions... or brings good marks in studies... then very proudly becomes your sister. This is good. Your pampering has spoiled her. You always take her side. Hey! God... its not good for a girl to stay till such late night. I know Rahul. But its not so late. Meeta is a mature girl... you don't worry, she will come. Good night, good night. Will you come tomorrow? Yes! I will wait. Me too. Oh! Sister in law, you? Today you got very late, where were you? Sister in law, I went to roam with my friend. We saw a movie, had dinner... she only dropped me here. We saw, I and... also your brother. What? Then... that means... I am sorry brother, I never lied to you. And today. - Then why did you lied to me today? Does an unknown man has come so close to you. That you have started lying to your brother and sister in law. No brother its not like that. Your brother always wanted you to be happy. And today also will do whatever your pleasure is. Actually, your brother and I wanted you to marry Jeet. What? No! But now it will not be like this. Tell us, who is this boy? What does he do? Belongs to which family? Where he lives? So that tomorrow I can go to his parents... and talk all the things. Oh, brother, you are so sweet! What is the matter, Rahul? You are looking little lost. Where are you? Yes, Rahul, I was also thinking the same thing? Is there any problem? If you have any problem, tell us. After all, we are your friends. And you know that I can do anything for friendship. This friendship only has locked my mouth. Can't understand, what to say? On one side there is friendship and on... the other side there is sister's love. I don't know whether I am right or wrong. But if it the same thing which I think... then you should see your sister's love and happiness. Don't worry about the friendship. - Thank you Jeet. You solved my problem. We have to go and see a boy for Meeta. Hey, isn't this awesome... there is no servant... and sir is also not here. What was his name? - Roshan. Meeta told this address. This is the voice of a girl. - May be coming from that room. Let's see. - Come. No Rahul. Its not right to go and meet this... man after knowing his reality. We have seen whatever we wanted to, now let's go from here. Yes, yes, its a lie. Roshan is not like this. I know he is not like this. I love him. He cannot be like this. - He is like this. A despicable man. Child, I can't understand how a wise girl like you... can gets trapped in his net. - You are trapping me in your net. By saying bad about Roshan... you think that I will start hating him. Will forget him. And will do whatever you say. Meeta, what are you saying? You are insulting him... so that I will marry Jeet. Meeta. - No Rahul, what are you doing? Like this you will only increase her problems. Handle yourself. Meeta, you! Roshan. Neither you came with wedding procession... nor I got left in the palanquin. But... give me blessings... that whenever I go from this house... should go in funeral bier. Stand up. Your place is not there... it is here. I knew that you will also love me as much... as I much I love you. That is why I left my brother's house. To you for always. Now I have no fear. No worries. Roshan, today I am very happy. Very happy. Who are you? Wear your spectacles. Its me. Jeet sir, you, wearing glasses. Oh mother! I have told you so many times that don't wait for me. If I get late then just have dinner and go to sleep. Why do you stay awake for so late? Every time you ask the same question. And gets the same answer from me. I have never slept without feeding you. My dear mother. I am not hungry, mother. You eat and sleep. What happened, son? Are you all right? Yes, its just alright. Should I go and talk with Meeta's brother? Son! Neither you talk with your friend... nor you say anything to Meeta. Just forget it mother. Hey, listen to me son, Jeet. Till tomorrow he was mad about Meeta. And today he is telling to leave her. Child, Binda, what is this? Roshan! What are you doing? Love. I also love you. But, all this, after the marriage. Now, we both will have to keep patience. Understood! - If I don't keep patience? Then. Then I will shout and make noise. Will gather the people. Then shout. Make noise. And call the people. Roshan. - Shout. Shout, call the people. Roshan. - Call. What are you doing, Roshan? Leave me. - Shout. Roshan! Call the people. - Roshan! Shout. Call. What are you doing? - Shout. No. No Roshan. Don't come near, Roshan. No. No. Good morning, very good morning. Hi Rahul, is Priya awake? Yes, she is awake but. - Very good. - Priya, come soon. Hi, Rahul. I have brought cauliflower and potato's fried bread for you. You all lazy bumps, are all same. - And, how are you friend? Priya! Hey, leave all this tea. There is chilled bear kept in the ice box. Will drink that. Okay, now get up and change, be quick. Hey, what is this happening? Where are we going? Picnic, brother, picnic. Picnic, suddenly! - Yes. What suddenly, today is holiday. And what can be better then going on the picnic today. All will go out together, whole day will spent having fun. Thank you friend! Thank you very much. Otherwise, thinking of what happened yesterday... it would have been difficult to pass this day. - Rahul! What happened? Meeta is not at home, has left this letter. What this mad girl has done. No. Meeta, what happened, Meeta? Brother, save me. He will kill me, brother. Arrest him inspector. Don't try to catch the death. You all will be burnt. You didn't recognise me. I am your death. This police... this prison cannot capture me. No one can capture me. If anything is captured that is everybody's... life is captured in my hands. I am your death, everybody's death. Help me! Leave him. There is one benefit from all this incidence... at least Meeta came to know about... the reality of that coward. Don't know what magic he did on Meeta? That Meeta even tried to leave her house for him. If something would have happened to my sister... I would have not forgive me. Hey, Priya. See if Meeta has slept then send Jenny down. We should go. Today you just sleep here. Its too late. Go tomorrow morning. Priya just tie this. Yes. Let's go and sleep its too late. Meeta, just sleep. Everything will be fine. Hey, this is me not Samuel. But I have habit, I will sleep like this. Okay, sleep. Sister in law! Help! Leave her. Help! Meeta. Stop it, I said stop it. Stop it or I will shoot. After all the investigation court has reached this conclusion. That criminal Roshan... is an evil and a dangerous murderer. Criminal Roshan is a ugly stain on the society. It is the duty of the law to eradicate it. Forcing with the innocent girls... and in blame to murder them... according to the clause 302 of Indian penal court... orders death penalty for the criminal Roshan. Samuel! Samuel! Samuel! Samuel! Oh! So you are sleeping here. I got tired finding you. Wake up, just wake up. No! No! Jenny! What happened Jenny? - Samuel! Samuel, I saw a very bad dream. That devil killed you. Then killed me. Jenny, this type of bad dreams... this type of bad thoughts comes... because that evil is still alive. That evil was given the worst punishment. Just keep courage. There is no cure for this disease of fear. If any place or anything... or in our case any person's fear gets in us... then it is very difficult to get rid of it. You are right Rahul. Something similar is happening with Jenny. What can I say, Veena also gets sudden upset... like she has seen very bad dream. And Meeta? Does Meeta also gets such bad dreams. Don't know she don't tell anything. Whole day she is silent. You? How strange? Who wanted to kill me... I did not got scared from him. And now getting scared from the one... who saved me. When the time comes a person... begins to know about the person. Meeta! Promise me. What? You just forget him. You also promise me. Tell me. - You also forget all. Forget about my mistake. Forget about all that happened. And give me a chance to start a new life. Again, with you. Yes Meeta, yes. My life is complete only with you. Oh! Jeet. Jeet. Will you do one thing for me. - What? If it was in my hands... then I must have killed that dog. I should have killed that coward. Should have shot her with gun. So that his existence forever ceases for me. But I cannot do like that. Then, what do you want? I want to see the death of that man. But, that's not possible. Okay, Meeta. I will bring special commission. So that from your and everyone's heart... his fear ends forever. Okay! Take care. God bless you my son. After two minutes from now... on this electric chair... you will be given punishment for your sins. And duty of law will be completed. But my son... to fulfill the duty of religion... whoever you want... will pray for you. So that your soul rest in peace. After your death. I will not die. Do you have any last wish? Meeta's body. He is dead. Help! What are you thinking? Nothing happened to you. You are alright. There is no need to worry. Come outside. I know every thing. I have her blood... ECG, scanning... X-ray, all has been done. After report we can decide the line of treatment. She was very tired so I gave her sleeping pills. If she does not wake up till tomorrow morning... then also there is no need to worry. Now it seems we should not have brought Meeta here. It is very difficult to forget what we saw today. Who knew that his death would be so scary. I have also seen many scenes in my life. But this scene was incomplete. Is incomplete. - What do you mean? He is not dead. - What are you talking? He is alive. - But. The doctor after seeing his nerves declared that he was dead. Nerves are for body. After seeing nerves doctor decides... whether a person is dead or alive. Stopping of nerves... does not decide the result of the soul. Soul's result remains incomplete. Look father, already we are disturbed and confused... and you by saying all this. - I understand. I understand my child. So seeing the seriousness of the matter. I want to warn you. For what are you warning us? Jesus also don't know this. Devil passes from his black way... and what will he do... this no one knows. Father, what is this evil and devil? Now you please go from here. We don't believe in all these things. One day you will believe, my son. And I am afraid of that day. He is still not dead. He is alive. Sir, I will bring cross from the jeep. Okay. What is this near the spinal cord. This is found only in animals. My god! You are here. - Please save me doctor. Otherwise I will die. What are you doing here? Alone at such late night. - This loneliness is killing me. Doctor! I have come here to get treated for this. Look, you go home, you need rest. Now there is no rest. You made my health worse. It looks like you did not check properly. Take a look again. Your pulse rate is normal. Even you don't have fever, you are all right. Hey, your body is so hot. Your heart is beating very fast. Or else... is this my heart beat? Tell me one thing doctor... again and again... why I yawn. Hey, where are you going? Will you not treat your patient? Ouch! What happened? This means that you care for me. Then why are you shying? Or else tell me that you don't like me. What are you talking? - I am telling the truth. Trust me, I have started loving you. This side, that side... don't feel good on either side. Just dreams about you. You thoughts are always on my mind. I feel shy of me. What thoughts did you get? Far away from here... you, me and loneliness... full moon... your lips talking with me. We both are very near to each other. Very near. And then suddenly... one cloud covers the moon. Wind started moving. Strong wind. Lightning in the sky started scorching. I got scared and came in your arms. Just hold me like this. Your last breath. - What are you doing? I just don't understand that when did she wake up... and when went away. It was just that I woke up and went on to her room. And saw that she was not there. Where must she have gone? We should call the police. I am feeling very worried. Meeta! Priya. - What happened? Rahul, what happened? Oh my god! What happened? She, in this condition? So late in the night. How she got unconscious? Rahul! All the things that are happening, are not good. This kind of a young girl. No! I am telling you that marry her soon. You are right, Priya. I will talk with Jeet tomorrow. Good evening, detective Karan. You really are a genius, sir. Shut up Chandani, say later. Inspector! - Yes. Is this correct that doctor Khanna is murdered? No sir. - Good. If he is not murdered then what are we doing here? Oh yes, this is also true. If their is no murder then what am I doing here? I am a famous detective. - Detective Karan. And I only take cases of murders, understood inspector. But he was dead after falling from the sixth floor. Amazing! Its impossible. But how can this happen? You fell, sir. - I know. It means that doctor earlier... would have fell from the chair then from the window. This is not known as postmortem report did not come. Oh I see report, listen... as soon as you get the report, tell me. So that your case gets solved. And you don't worry about my fees... Chandani will take care of it. Now can I say something. - Yes, tell. Sir, you really are a genius, sir. Oh thank you very much, thank you. I was ready to marry Meeta tomorrow... and is ready today also. But looking at her mind condition... who will ask her about the wedding? If mom would have been alive then she would have talk. I will talk to Meeta. I will explain her. After all I am also her mother. Only a mother's love know, what her heart is going through? She will forget all her sorrows in mother's love. She will forget all her pains. Rahul, first I will go and meet Meeta. And afterwards you come there with Jeet. Look Jeet... your bride will be dressed for you. Oh mom, you are just. Mom, I will call Priya and she will take you there. Hello, yes, okay, well. Meeta, get ready soon. Jeet's mother is coming. - Why? No why, nothing, I will have to go and bring her. But sister in law, why are you going? Because she does not know our address. Why she wants to come here? When she will come you yourself will come to know, understood. Aunty! Come Priya madam, mother is waiting for you. Where is aunty? - She is upstairs. One minute. Aunty! Aunty! Hello aunty. - Come child, how is Meeta? She is perfectly fine. I told her that I am going to take you. Seems like from today everything will be fine. I was eagerly waiting for this moment. Now they should get married as early as possible. Yes aunty. If they both get married then we will become in laws. And then I will call you mom not aunty. You are my daughter. After the marriage, I will not keep Meeta as daughter in law... but will keep as the daughter in this house. That means your son will be son in law. Let's go aunty. - Let's go. Binda we will come. Hey, why you stopped the car? Because after this where you want to go... there car doesn't go. No! Taxi! Taxi! Oh! Rahul, Jeet. Hey Priya, you. What are you doing here? - Finding taxi. I have been waiting here from very long to go to Jeet's house. But there is no taxi. We were thinking that you and mom would have reached home. You are going to your home. - Yes, you must be in hurry. First we should go to your house to pick up aunty. Okay. - Come, sit. Aunty, aunty. What are you joking, wearing glasses? Before some time mom has left with you, wearing glasses. Binda, she is Priya madam. Yes I can see, she is Priya madam. Then tell us, where is mom? I told you... a while ago she left with her. How can this happen? Priya met us in the way. Yes, I didn't come here. Then how can mom come with me. Binda, you get treatment for your eyes. How can mom go with her? Hello! Yes, speaking... what? What are you talking? Yes, I am reaching there. What happened? The phone was from the police station. Mom's got an accident. They have called me there quickly. Rahul! What has happened? I am sorry, accident was so tremendous... that everything was over on the spot. And the one who was driving? Your mom was driving the car. But mom didn't knew to drive the car. His servant was saying that... one woman came... who took the mom with her. But she was found alone in the car. Where you got the car. - Near the old mansion. I told you, he is not dead, he is alive. The devil is awake. Oh! Lord. Merci! Merci! Believe me my son, trust me. Devil has started his game. Father please, I have told you earlier... Don't talk like this. Okay my son. My knowledge is very limited. That is why I can't argue. Pathari Baba is very wise. I will go and try to understand it. Will meet you after that. God bless you. Excuse me! I doubt this priest. You really are a genius, sir. Shut up Charlie, say all this later. But I was telling that. - Listen. The body was found near the mansion, let's go there. Do you have torch. No sir, I have candle. Why do you use candle? Sir, if battery gets down, torch won't work. There should be light in the mansion. But we won't use the light. Will find in the dark. What, sir? Will know this after going there. You really are a genius, sir. Thank you, thank you. That priest was saying that all these incidences... are related with that one incidence. Which happened with Meeta. Doctor's death. Mom's body was found near the mansion. All this is not the co-incidence. But all this is done by that man... who is still alive after his death. I want to say that... that for some days... should go far from here. Jeet's pain will also decrease. And this difficult time will also pass. But, have you seen Meeta's condition. What happened to her? You yourself go and see. I will go and see. Meeta is sleeping. I have full faith... that now nothing will happen to Meeta. May Christ be with her all the time. Poor! Don't know, for what she is getting punishments? What a hectic day? All this has made me tired. That's so true, you make drink I will go and fresh. Come soon. - Yeah! Cheers darling! Go! Shameless! How long will it take, darling? - Only two minutes. Two minutes, oh my god! You are talking of two minutes. Here, two seconds of waiting are too heavy. You are always in a hurry. Why are you in so much hurry? You first come out... then I will tell you why I am in so much hurry? Oh! If I won't come then. Then your darling will come inside. No Samy. - Yes Jenny. No Samy, no. - And here I come. What happened to light? - Don't worry Jenny, be happy. I have match box, I will go and see what happened? A 1 and 2 and I love you. No Jenny. No. Of father. On the name of his father, his son and his holy spirit. Lay the body to rest. How all this happened? Why happened? I can't understand anything. Priya, how he died? Don't know? But the girl who went with Samuel... her face was like you. But that's impossible. The impossible is becoming possible. To which I was scared, only that is happening. He is not dead. He is alive. Only his body is dead. His soul is still alive. Only his body is in grave. But his soul to take revenge... is constantly giving births to new sins. Come Priya. Come Jenny. Listen my son. What is this all happening? How is this happening? Its all out of my understanding. You go to Pathari Baba. He knows everything. He will surely. - But father, who is this Pathari Baba? He have solution to every problem. And you are asking who is Pathari Baba? My son, don't waste time. Quickly go to him. Who was this Roshan? Definitely was a devil. That is why I am telling you to go to Pathari Baba. Please, go soon. He will definitely help you. Yes. Sir, I have brought this candle. Yes, blow off the candle. Sir, but how will you work in the dark? This work is done in the dark so I have off the lights. Sir, is your fuse is gone. No, this is my dark room. And I developed photos here. You are a genius detective Karan. Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Oh! Chandani. Oh my Chandani! My darling, you are so naughty. Oh Chandani. Sir, you sing very nicely in dark. Oh really, on the lights I will sing much better. Will sing more melodious. Oh Chandani, my Chandani. What happened? - Sir, photos. What is after the thing? Oh! Let it be, look what? Either the film would have been over exposed... or priest would have been underexposed. But film would be exposed. Sir, you really are a genius. Poor, father Robert. Amazing! Police also can't understand how he was dead? How does the church's cross fell on him? Excuse me. Can I come inside? - Come. I have an important work from you. Tell me. - Does anyone is listening? No, no one is here. But, what do you want? Wait, its a secret. Yes, look at this. What is this? - Just look at this. I don't have any interest in such photos. Just, look, you will be surprised. What is this in this photo? - Look, look. What? Oh my god! This is the same form in which the... father Robert died. - Exactly. By the way... you don't tell anyone that this photograph is taken by me. Otherwise I will be in trouble. When did you take this photograph. - Before his death. I am investigating will come to know everything. By the way you have the photograph of him. No. - Your photograph. No. - Oh I see. Then allow me to take yours. I mean, photograph. Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me. What is this going on? Isn't it true what father Robert use to say. I think I have to meet that Baba, he use to mention. What was his name? Yes! Pathari Baba. What are looking for in the pile of ash? Nothing will be found. Go from here. Father Robert... told something else about you. Are you Pathari Baba? Stone. Stone. That priest came here. Refused him million times. Explained him many times but he didn't understood. He died. All will die. You will also die. Death. Who is survived from death so far and I am no exception. I just want know that why all are dying without any reason? Father. Father Robert definitely knew something. He repeatedly warned us. He kept saying that we should come and meet you... you will help us. - Now I have come to you, tell me. Tell me, what is this all happening? If you know then tell me what is this happening? I don't like anyone shouting. And neither I do anything on someone's saying. I. Tell me only that... whatever is happening is just a coincidence. Or behind this any, ghost, devil or evil powers... or black magic's sinful motive. Stone. Stone. If my answer is yes then... what will you do? Will get scared and run away. You will not be able to face it. If... that was the case then why would I try to know all this? I don't care for my life. I just care about my friends. Priest was also worried about this. That he keep saying... he is not dead. He is still alive. Yes. He use to say this. The motive of that evil is murder. Everyone's murder. Why, when, how and where? This Pathari will know it. Stone. Stone. Just take care of one thing. This secret should be a secret. Whatever I am doing, no one should know about it. Neither to Rahul nor to Anand. Yes, but... it will be very be very difficult... for me to prepare the documents. Why? Because they both are also partner of this company. And without their signature it is impossible to do anything. To make impossible... possible, how much money it will cost? It is question of such a big property. So before taking any kind of risk, we should think. Whatever I am doing is doing after thinking a lot. Is doing on my own risk. You just prepare papers quickly, please. Okay. Wow, my friend! How you fulfilled our friendship? Where there are friends like you, there is no need of enemies. So you were listening to us? - Yes. I have heard each and every thing. Each word... is sounding like a abuse in my ears. I only wanted to know... that why are you doing this to us? What? What am I doing? - You want to snatch our share. You are cheating with Rahul and me. No Anand, I was talking about Samuel. You also want to snatch Samuel's share. That is why you gave lawyer as much money, as he want. So that he could prepare documents. Have you said everything or do you want to say more. There is something remaining. Not of your friends... at least would have thought of that widow. "World, world of love." "World, world of friends." "World, world of friends." "World, world of love." "It is filled of colors, sunken in waves, full of enthusiasm." "It is filled of colors, sunken in waves, full of enthusiasm." "World, world of love." "World, world of friends."

Come let's go and sit at home. No, its okay here. This open air. This loneliness. This sea shore. And, you and me. And only we both. - And my Samuel's memories. Forget him. For how long you will cry for him? And waste your this beautiful face... and your this savvy youth. Jeet, what are you talking? He was your friend. I have come to fulfill friendship. Taking you in my arms. - No Jeet. By coming close to you I want to remove... Samuel's memories forever. - Leave me. Scoundrel, dog, you killed Jenny. Now standing here and showing sympathy. Rahul, hand him over to police. He is a murderer. Anand, what are you talking? You. You have done it all. You have done all this murder. First Samuel and now Jenny. Hungary of wealth. I know why are you doing this? You are not in the sense, you are drunkard. Yes, I am drunkard. I am drunkard but I don't drink blood of my friends. That is why you should make all the... papers together with the lawyer. So that you kill us all one by one. Be entitled to all wealth. Jeet can never do this. Before putting such a big blame you should have to thought. Jeet is our friend. He is fulfilling a good friendship. But I will open all his secrets. Then you will come to know that... who is friend and who is enemy? Anand! Don't know why is he thinking bad about me? How should I explain him? Don't know what he has seen and what he heard? Rahul, I don't know anything? I don't know? Sir, what are you searching? Oh shut up Chandani, I am thinking. You are thinking? You are a genius, sir. Why you need to think? I was thinking that what I was thing? About what, sir? - About me. I was thinking that if I solve this case in the same speed... like I solve other cases then what will happen to me? Let me think. Let me think. Wow! Beautiful sir. Exactly, but for what you are doing wow? Sir, one minute. Sir, your pose. Sir, till now you have taken photographs of others... today I will take your photo. Photo!

What happened to you sir. Who made you in this condition? Is this my photo or of any ghost. Listen, was you in a hospital before? No, no, sir. - Then what is this? Neither there is any injury on me then... from where these bandages came on me. This is the second photo which is developed. Second. - Yes. So whose first photo was? Who died? Dead? Neither you lie nor Anand. That was your form who murdered. But that was not you. That was Nagi. Nagi, who Nagi? To whom you know by the name of Roshan. But, but, how can this happen? Stone! If you don't believe me then why you come here? If you don't trust me then go out from here. Go from here. Please, forgive me Baba. I even don't trust me. If you want to know the truth then come with me. Where? - At Nagi's house. Stone! Stone! Stone! Darkness always shadows the light. In the house that is visible in light... lives the Roshan. And for the one who flourishes in the dark is this graveyard. This is Nagi's real house. How terrible is the atmosphere here? What a dangerous place it is? After all who is this Nagi? What he wants? I can read this, I can read all of this. The power that I got from the years of the penance... on the strength of that... I can read the stories of Nagi written on every stone here. Stone! After years of worshipping the devil... Nagi himself has become a demon. He received this boon... that he will be always young and beautiful. Provided that... by fulfilling the desires from a virgin girl... should bath in their blood. There is so much evil powers in him... that he can take anyone's appearance. Can kill anyone. You people have made him angry by rescuing Meeta. He is taking revenge for that. Now don't know whose turn? Before I could reach to Anand... can tell him anything... Nagi again then reached to him in a new appearance. That happened, which should not have happened. Stone! Listen to me carefully. Sinner leave the mark of his sin somewhere. To body that Nagi thinks as his dress... that body also have one mark. What mark? That mark is alive. It can be on any part of the body. We have to find out that mark without Nagi knowing it. What are you thinking? Nothing. How nothing? One by one all our friends are dying. And you are saying, nothing. What do you think? Anand's doubt on Jeet. What are you saying? You don't trust your friend. Oh! Can't understand anything. I don't know what's happening? Hello. Do you want to know about your friend's death? Then immediately come to hotel Sea Queen. - Who is there? Whose phone was that? Lawyer's, he wants to meet me. Now, this time? Yes, no need to worry. I will just come. You backstabber. You have fallen so much that in the hunger of lust... that you are looking at the respect of my sister. No friend, no. You are an enemy hidden in the form of friend. No Rahul no, you are misunderstanding me. This time Meeta needs us. That mark on his body. - How dare you touch her body? Anand was right about you. You killed Jenny. You are killing all the others. That is why you are preparing that documents. These are the documents. I was preparing them so that Jenny's future. So that you get the shares of Jenny's and Samuel. But before that I will kill you. Rahul, listen to me. Rahul! Wait, otherwise I will also hit you. Rahul, what are you doing? Jeet, what are you doing? Leave. I will not leave him. - Leave! You have lost your senses in anger, Rahul. It should not happen that you get too late. Jeet, Jeet. What are you doing? Rahul! What did you do, Rahul? You suspected your friend? Blamed him. At least would have read these papers before doing anything. Its written clearly here... that if anything happens to Jeet... then all his property and wealth... will be given to Jenny. Read, read it. Ah! No, Rahul, no. No Rahul. No. No. No. Leave, help! Rahul. Help! Priya! Priya! Priya! Oh no! What I did? Why didn't you killed me? Why didn't you killed a sinner, a murderer like me. I, you... from my mind and heart... my soul... my existence... was loving you from all my heart and soul. That devious devil has dominated me and killed you. Till the time I don't kill that devil... till then I will never forgive myself. Will never forgive. Priya! My Priya died. My Priya was murdered. And you know who killed her? I. I killed my wife with my hands. Tell me Jeet... that devil was in me. Or I was in that devil. Tell me Jeet, what is this all happening? This blood, this murder, this horror. Tell me because only you know it. Yes friend, I know everything. You come with me. - Where? It's already too late. I will explain you everything in the way. Baba! Baba! - Listening. Listening to all. Seeing everything. Whether soul is healthy or sinner... soul is immortal. Holy spirit meets the god. And the sinful spirit in the devil. This devil spirit should leave the Meeta's body. But, how? Lust, anger, greed, attachment, glamour. These five are the weakness of the soul. These weaknesses destroys everyone. It will also be destroyed. Must be destroyed. - But what is the weakness of this devil? His body. Where is his body buried? Stone! We know where is his grave? Then destroy his grave. Tear the earth's womb. Nude his body. And take him there... where he is doing sins of lust and blood. Wherever his soul will be. Will come there in the greed of his body. Will definitely come there. And, will go again in his body. But then it will be more difficult. After getting his body... he will start doing the same. Which he use to do before. - No. Pathari will not let this happen. Will not let do. Stone! Stone! Nothing is done before its time. And the time has not come... that palm lines of Pathari... get the credit of Nagi's death. You know why? - Why? This sinful soul is interrupting this holy work. That means Meeta. - No! Only her body. But the soul of this devil. The race is started between him and me. If delayed more... then Pathari will lose this race. You will lose this race. God will lose this race. No, it will never happen, let him come. We will him here. By giving Nagi's body to Nagi's soul... will kill him. - If he can die so easily then why suffer so much? Let this devil deceive the refuge of this earth. Rip off the earth and uproot the corridor to the zombies. Hurry up! Hurry up! Meeta. Don't stop, let the car go ahead. But Baba? I am telling you to go ahead. Baba, she will die. - She will not die, nothing will happen to her. As soon as the soul of the devil in Meeta's body... will come in his sinful place. You strike this statue with this holy axe. Yes. This statue is form of sinful soul of Nagi. The injury will happen to Nagi not to this. And he will be suffering from the injury. And after leaving the Meeta's body... will search for his body. And as soon as he gets his body... and life will come in this dead body. And he will be alive. Yes, then I will hit it. Will kill him. And I will burn this sinful place. Yes, this place of the devil in this fire... worshipper of the devil will be burnt. I will bring the things to burn. Ah! Wait Meeta. You hit her. No! You hit. Hurry up! Hit it! Hit again. Keep on hitting, don't stop. Baba! Help! Meeta, wake up. Meeta! Jeet! Huh! Jeet, move.
