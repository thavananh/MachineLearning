Shyamal Sen speaking. What do you mean? No, I can't. I've told you, I can't. It's not my job, It's someone else's job. Bastard. Washed the car, Keshab? I'd be leaving right away. I'm in a rush. What's wrong? Don't you smell something burning? No. I can smell it. Something burning. Can't you smell it? Hello. What Hello! It's halogen. The office is all lit up. When are you reaching? In fifteen minutes. Come along. They'll be deciding on the Vice-President today. It's either you or me. But whoever it is, we'll enjoy it, I'm sure. Come along. Best of luck. Thanks. Hi, handsome! Good morning. Good morning. Listen, this is the latest. Shoot! It takes years to hang kasab, months to punish Kalamadi, and minutes to arrest Anna Hazare, Wah bhai! Mera Bharat Mahan. How many of them? Three. Khambe, Banerjee and... Good morning, Sonya. Good morning. Shyamal? Not yet. Think of that! Hey, Jyoti! Listen! What's on between Duli and Shyamal? Jeez! The lift seems to be moving slower today. Shyamal-Babu! Good morning. It's either your day or mine. That's why I came out to greet you. You needn't get into a tension. There's always a winner and a loser. Don't get into a sulk if you lose out. Good morning gentlemen. Are you certain what you're saying, Deva? I've put in a lot of money. Take my word, he's good. It's good for him to stay away from girls. Fringe benefits. What's wrong? Runu Sanyal has signed up Hari Bose. He has signed, you mean? Are you sure? Looks like that. Bursting with confidence. Meanwhile there are two Special Branch blokes... snooping around from the morning. Purpose? Yet to give a clue. The MD's in. Get ready. I don't have a say any longer. It's for you to decide. What did he say? Didn't seem to like the idea. Father didn't like it, you say? Maybe he doesn't understand, or maybe refuse to understand, why it's important for me to go to London. Nobody understands, nobody, charu, what a struggle it has been to create this situation. What can I do if someone is not happy after all this? Don't say he's not happy. God knows. After uncle passed away, father's all so worried about dada, my cousin. May be he's happy. But... the moment I told him, he went into how dada has no future who's going to provide for him. If I'm going to London, do I owe everyone an explanation? Can you tell me why it's me who has to give explanations? It was I who took the decision on our marriage. Your parents weren't happy over it. I married you because I loved you. What my parents thought doesn't in the least matter to me. All that I know is that... You are different from everyone else. And you are honest. I am pregnant, Shyamal. Hello. Tell me. What're you doing? Shyamal's just left. I've all the time in the world. Don't you have all the time even when he's in? Still you can't make time. Runu was telling me there's something up over the Vice-Presidentship? Ye-es, Shyamal too seems to be in the running. There is some tension over that. I've told Runu, once he's the VP, it'll be Switzerland. You? Sonarpur. What? Don't be funny. Haven't been home for a long time. What'll you do there? There's nobody there. But I feel such an urge. I can see it all. On Page 3 Husband chosen Vice-President. Wife off to Sonarpur. Come on, let's go for a Thai spa. Special offer this week. Male masseurs. Get going. Sprayed incense for you, Natun Bou. The serial's starting. Aren't you coming? I'm coming. Enough, Jyathai-ma. Ok, Ok... Charu, it's impossible. I'm leaving for London in fifteen days. Who'll look after you? What looking after are you talking about? Charu, try to understand. In your present physical condition. For six months I'll be in London. Please let me come back. I need no one to look after me. I can take care of myself. Please try to understand, Charu. It took me a lot to reach here. It was not easy. But life is not just a career and a job, Shyamal. Nobody knows it better than me. In order to live well, you have to earn more. Much more than a common man. I'm talking of a different life, Shyamal. I don't mean what you suggest. There was a night... You may not remember any longer... we shared a dream. I remember it, Charu. But this is not the right time to start a family. There's a long road before us. Let me come back. Meanwhile I'll talk to Dr.Basu. He has a nursing home. Please don't. Charu, please. Listen to me. There's a storm coming. Shut the doors and windows. Get up. Is it your first pregnancy? Why don't you want it? Going to London for an important training programme. Who's going to take care of her? I'll also be in a tension. That is why... Get admitted day after tomorrow. Report in the morning, You will be released in the evening. Hope there's no risk? Dont worry. Nothing to stop your foreign trip. Careful! It is glass. Put your hand under it. Give it to Keshab. Charu! Won't you get ready? Why are you poring over all that rubbish? Sure you've taken my London pictures? Take care! London pictures. They're in the bag. Look up your father for once. Why? He has been sitting up far a long while. Gave him his tea. Didn't take it. Found Dada standing on the terrace. Why don't you meet them once? I won't. All those sick middleclass sentiments. I have to leave this house to achieve anything at all. What do you think you want? You want me to be like dada? A failure? Let's go. Go ahead. That'll do, my child. Goodbye. So even Jyathai-ma wouldn't see us off? Father has turned into a strange creature. Do these sentiments mean a thing today? Clinging to all that old stuff. What now? Let's go. They all thought dada would land a big job, the brilliant student that he was. But it was I who got the big job. Nobody's coming to see us off. Let's go. Have you put all the luggage on the van? - Yes Sir. Have you checked? Yes. Ok. let's go. Bhalo Khoka [ Good child ] Where did the ashes come from? Have you checked all your things? Sure you haven't left anything behind? Dada! That'll do, my child. Won't you come to our place? Of course. Bhalo khoka, I don't know the area well enough. Shall I find the place? You'll make it. Bye. Let's go. Runu Sanyal is up to something. Trying to implicate you. Good morning. Very goodmorning, Duli. I am sorry. How did you like the decoration upstairs? By the way, what'll the two of us do with all this space? Why? A separate room for every separate day. Let me go. Have to go for my bath. I'll give you one. Thanks. The GM is lucky. Lucky GM and his EA. No harm trying. If my luck favours me, I can also go to the forest bungalow with her. Get to a double bed. Careful buddy, it's the GM's girl. You could risk your job. She didn't hear it. Carry on with your tea. Shyamal! How did they all get to know about it? That's a question I'm asking too. Isn't it a question you should be asking yourself? What's new in our city Mrs. Chatterjee? Nothing much. The usual. Whether the State Government would stick... to the Centre after a 2 rupee rise in the price of petrol... 47 children meanwhile have died... in the last 6 days in hospitals. Then there's of course page 3, people raving over... Naseeruddin and Parash Rawal on stage. You have a lovely sanse of humour, Mrs. Chatterjee "Calcutta remains where it is" Well Mrs. Chatterjee, We are deciding today... between Ranadip and Shyamal. For sure. That's very important. We need the right leader. What would be your take, Mr. Chatterjee? How I would love to be back here always. You need a lot of sponsorship... to run an NGO. One has to devote all one's time to it. We didn't give it much thought when we started. Bibi talks a lot, but when it comes to work, she's useless. Don't worry. I'll not ask you to get a sponsor. Why not? We need a celebrity. Publicity's important. How will you get it? We'll get it. Tomorrow's Saturday. Can't we go out for lunch? Sorry, I can't, darling. I have an important meeting. Runu Sanyal will be completely out of race, if I can strike this deal with Nissan. Don't go and tell it to Bibi, You're such great pals. So you won't go? Aren't you Hari Bose? I'm a great fan of yours. Thank you. Juice, Memsaab. OK. I have many friends in the film industry. We can meet again. Take a shot for me, please. Oh, sure. Don't mind, I'll clean it for you, Memsaab. Check, please. Pardon, Madam? Give me my check. This must be yours. Do you leave everything behind like this? Thanks. Please don't mention. A chance to help someone like you... - Thanks. You thank me before I've had my say. I know what you were going to say. Great. I'd love to carry on with the conversation. Are you interested in sports, say, cricket? But why? If you had been, you'd have recognized me, I'm Hari... - Hari Bose. You're likely to be in the Knight Riders coming season. Last week you were involved in a scandal... with some foreigner at a disco. Read about it somewhere. You scored a hit. Nice meeting you. Bye! You'll leave me alone like this? You... Are you Alone? My child hasn't had anything to eat for two days. We went to Paris for the first time. You know how good Mr. Dutta is in French. He taught me French. It was French all the time. I was in Mauritius last week. You just won't believe what we spent there. 20,000 dollars. - Excuse me please. How are you, Mrs. Kulkarni? Got late? Charu? Good evening, everybody. Let me introduce to you... the star of tonight's party, Kolkata's blue-eyed boy, and... In all probability... the trumpcard of the Knight Riders this season... Hari Bose. Hi, Shyamal, Look who's here. Hi! Such an honour. Thank you, Sir. Please feel at home. Your wife's enough... to set men's heads reeling. How many have you had? Wouldn't you prefer to start with a couple of pegs? What do you have? Scotch? Costlier than that. Segal malt, 18 years. Great. Let's have it then. Don't you have that prawn stuff to go with it? What d'you call them? Golden prawn ball? We have them. But beware of yours. Hold yours too. Listen, The company wants to make Hari Bose its brand ambassador. As usual, it's fallen on me. Now you know why he's here. Best of luck! One player taking another. Keep your sword in the scabbard Lest it take a few lives. Come with me, we've something to discuss. Please don't mind. Where are you off to? Why did you move away from Hari? What did I tell you? Really! Stay close to him. Will you never learn? Hello, Mrs. Chatterjee, As usual looking gorgeous. There's magic in your hands. You think so? You live in the Udita Apartments? You live alone? But why do you ask? Shouldn't we be checking whether you are sleeping well? Would you then take care to lull me to sleep? Could do it if you so desired. But I'm a bird of the night. Good evening. Nice house. Thank you. I told you we'll be meeting again. I didn't know then who you were. Does knowing help? No. Mr. Sanyal was telling me, Shyamal Sen's wife is hot property. So very true. So you've got introduced? My wife, Charu. You can see... how hard it is to have a moment with one's wife. Charu, please! Excuse me. By the way, she's a mobile encyclopedia on cricket. Is that true? What? That he has no time for you. I don't think he mentioned the word 'time' Maybe he doesn't have time even for that. But I have the time. Endless. Bhalo Khoka! Shyamal! Haven't been to see you for a long time. So I came along. Where's Charu? Dada, you? Here you are... Came along, just like that. Brought a small gift for you. Fish fry from... Metro Cafe. Come, dada, come with me. Sit down, Dada. Didn't you have an almirah here? Yes. It has been taken to an inner room. What beautiful ornamentation it had! It was the work of... What's the name... Anwar... Anwar Ours was an old orthodox family. Muslims were not allowed within the house. But he was such a wonderful craftsman, that father said, you should come within and work. It was made at home? Of course. It's Burma teak. So you change the rooms... quite often? Hadn't I told you to call us before you come? We could have been out. Sorry to have turned up... without warning and been a bother. I'll be back, Dada. I'll get some tea for you. Your mail, Sir. Leave it on my table. - Ok, Sir. Where's the cafetaria, please? Go straght, it's on the left hand side. Got it? Can I give it to Duli? No, give it to me. Sir, are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. A first class, Has anyone ever done it? Come, let me hug you, Was it OK? Perfect. Just take care... not to bend too much. That could create a problem... with the ball at your feet. You'll lose your balance. Otherwise perfect. Well done. Everyone's talking of him. What's your take on it? Terrific talent. Reminds me of Yuvraj Singh. If he's so good at the nets! Isn't he amazing? Oh, I'm in love with you. What would you have? Can I have whetever I desire? Here you don't get anything cheap. Sit down, please. Is it... nobody to talk to the day long with you, and then in the evening. There's someone talking to you already. Why are you a bachelor still? Are you ready to marry me? Don't be silly. One can marry whenever one wants to. But with ladies like you.. - Thanks. Once again... Thanks before I've finished. We won't take up much of your time. We have an NGO, Mrittika. We work with poor children... in remote villages or backward areas. Your support will be a great help. In getting sponsors. Here are some papers for you. You can go through them. Actually... we need you as our patron. Who'll be there at the meetings? You all? Then I'm ready. I may not be there at every meeting. Why don't you take it as just charity. Don't you do some? I do some. But nothing that calls for gloating. What's your programme for the day? Programme, my foot! You should take a look at my schedule. Hope you'll come home early? Why? Nothing special. Don't give it... Not feeling well. Something wrong? Some uneasiness. You won't have anything? I don't feel like it. I'll pick up something. With all the pressure... Hope I can clinch the Nissan deal. Bye! I could pick you up. Then we could have lunch together. Will you come? Awfully tied up. Keshab? He has taken down all your stuff. Happy birthday. Let it be. You had forgotten. Have you gone mad? I was just studying your reaction. You look so gloomy. So what's the plan, birthday girl? I told you. Let's go for lunch. No chance, darling. It's oue of those days! Why don't you find out someone who's free. You should gone out on your birthday. Have I gone out ever with anybody but you? See what you can do. Bye. Bye. Hello. - What are you doing? Oh, it's you. Reading a book. - Is that the truth? Why should I lie? Of course, why should you? But... Hold on please, there's someone at the door. Happy birthday! You? Thanks a lot. Let it be. You won't be able to carry it. How did you know? Easy. Club roster. Oh! So you locate every girl's birthday from the roster. And go visiting them with flowers. Not every girl. But... Nice place. So you keep every guest standing at the door, and don't ask him to come in. So sorry. Please come in. Where's Mr. Sen? Office. Even today? Why? That's what people say. After a few years of marriage... Ten years. Ten years? Difficult to believe. You're such a big celebrity. Still you took time out of your busy schedule... to wish me on my birthday. How do I play the host? Feeling nervous. What do I offer you to eat? Won't eat. We'll go out. How long do you take to get ready? After ten years of marriage Mr. Sen can... leave you alone on your birthday. But I'm not that insensitive. Please, madam. Allow me to take you out for lunch. You could write a book. How to Flirt With Old Wives. Sit down, please. I won't take too long to get ready. OK, Thank you. Done, Sir. They've arranged a forest bungalow in Jharkhand. Good. Tough, very tough. Land acquisition will be easy if we can close the deal. How can Runu get to know of everything? Runu Sanyal may have a link-up. Why is he sending me then instead of going himself? Corporates are not simple people, Sir. And it's a big challenge for you, Sir. If you can swing the land... Your position, Sir... - Let's see. I enjoy this tension a lot. Maybe this is what I wanted. What did you want? I didn't want to grovel where I come from. You're from Purulia, aren't you? Yes Sir. My father taught Bengali... in the Purulia Zila School. My mother was a Santal. Father put in a lot of effort... to bring the two of us up, my ealder brother and me. There were days when we had... a single meal of rice with salt, Which our parents had to do without. Sorry. Oh no, nothing to be. Let's get back. The Globsyn CEO will come at 11.30. It should carry on into lunch. Then we have a meeting at 3 O' clock. Between the two... Sir! Between the two, Mr. Sreenivasan from our legal... Duli, will you do me a favour? Could you please go out and buy a watch for my wife? It's her birthday. Sure, Sir. You can take my car. I'm instructing Keshav. Don't worry. Can't you see there's nobody here to set up a scandal! 50 percent of the people don't recognize me. Even if they did... they wouldn't approach me, it hurts their ego. If you don't mind, can I use the more familiar "tumi" to address you? When 50 percent of the people don't know you any way... you may. What's the matter? Didn't quite get you. It's nothing. Let's go! Haven't bought your birthday gift yet! What's the formality? Stop it. Come with me. How can I leave you without a birthday gift? Please. I told you I don't want anything. Oh, it's you. We'll be going in the same direction. We'll be going in the same direction. Dusky beauty. So sorry. Your gift. I don't wear a watch. If we don't go now, She may get lost in the crowd. Come on. Excuse me. It's beautiful. You have great taste. You too. Sit down please. Duli, I don't know if you are free this evening. Actually, it's a small party for Charu's birthday, at home. I'd be so happy if you could come. Payback for bringing the gift? Duli, I'm not Runu Sanyal. Whatever I do, I do it from the heart. I'd have invited you even if you hadn't picked up the gift. A small party with close friends, mostly Charu's. I'd really like it if you came. Please! When women speak, they often have double meanung. I thought you could read them. I'll come. Meet my Executive Assistant, Duli. My wife Charu. Do you, by any chance, know each other? I know her, Sir. Happy birthday ma'am. I see your portrait on his table every day. And who'd forget such a charming lady? Thank you so much. Charu, you're a real friend. You invited Hari, and so you invited me alone. Happy birthday. Charu, Your ultimate birthday surprise. Feed your wife, pal. Can I say something? Shyamal's been lucky to have found a wife like you. I'm not sure if the bastard deserved as much... Sorry. Careful, Jyoti. Don't take advantage of your bachelordom. Jeez. We're going to Jharkhand tomorrow. Excited. Why? I don't know why. I never have to look for a partner. Why have different outcomes on the same beat? Yours is over there. Who cares? I'm sure you know the story of Arjuna and his bird's-eye target. May I? Won't you dance? No. I only observe. What do you observe? Say, you. Oh! How handsome he is. Has the woman said anything? Are you scared? For you. Then drop it. Dada? The picture's really funny. I was out. You had to go back. I couldn't find your mobile number. Happy birthday. I must have rung you up at the wrong time again. No, Dada. Accept my pranaam. Take care. The picture's from when... Bhalo Khoka had just started walking. My father shot it. Goodbye. OK. Hope you are not angry anymore. Arranged the party at such short notice. Forgive me if I missed out on anything. I had to cancel an important meeting at the office... to go myself... and pick this up for you. Take a look at it and see if you like it. Can we get some basic information from you... about some of your officers? We don't have much information as such on all of them... I said basic. GM Marketing is Ranadip Sanyal. And GM Sales... - Shyamal... Shyamal Sen. Why? Then let's start with Shyamal Sen. Use these figures to draw up the chart. I'll check out later... Here you are. Hari Bose, our company's brand ambassador. I've fixed it. Right on time for the selection of the VP. Your friend... Best of luck. Thank you. Swine. What's wrong? Thought of Dada. Mithun or Saurabh? My dada. But this dadagiri seems to be... Runu Sanyal's. The Special Branch is now with Mrs. Chatterjee. Shyamal, do you remember that... Tolstoy story? That one about a greedy farmer... who always dreamt of a huge plot of land. Someone told him... all the land that you can run through in a day... will be yours. Who could hold him back then? He went on running... running, running and running... till he had forgotten to come back. When he thought of returning... and did come back, he was at death's door. How much land was allotted for him? 6 feet, just 6 feet. Whatever was needed to bury him. Shyamal, tell that bitch of yours... this story some day. Even 6 feet may be too much for her. They have found a cyst in the kidney. And they say it has to be removed at the earliest. How long will it take? At last 2 weeks. What happens here? I'll give you a replacement. She's a smart girl, Sir. Hi! Please come. Send the audit file to my room, please. Our MD is asking us to make a fullfledged drive... to make Hari Bose our brand ambassador. Hari Bose is absolute indispensable... to raise our growth... over last year's. Market research, Sir. Hello! Is it your new EA? Yes, Why suddenly on the land line? No EA would pick up the mobile. Listen, dada rang up. Next Saturday it's father's first year's memorial service. I won't have time. Just hold on for a second. Come in please. I will call you later. Nobody can rise beyond the leg. Legs... Dark long legs. The whole office is staring at the leg. Have you managed to rise... a little higher? Coffee, Sir? Black for you. Yes. Coffee for you? OK. Have you been introduced? GM Marketing, Ranadip Sanyal. Yes, Sir. - Of course. Mine with milk. Coffee. Why are you here? Smart office. Why have you come here? It's boring. Feeding off my sister. Nothing to bother about. Give me some money. Let me bring lunch for both of us. Duli, postpone the 2.30 meeting by half an hour. We'll be back in a while. - Yes Sir. Sir, My elder brother, Siddhartha. What do you do, Siddhartha? Politics. Got no job. Never had a chance to put on a suit and lord it all over. The meeting won't get postponed by itself. You have to make 12 phone calls. Please keep that in mind. - Yes, Sir. Height of presumption! Go away from here. There'll be no lunch. There's nothing in the canteen, I checked with the liftman. Will you go? Why don't you give me... 200 rupees? We'll have a Chinese lunch together. Here you are. Are you free? Excuse me. Let's go out for lunch. I have a lot of pressure. I have my pressure too. I'm married too, like Shyamal. Does it matter at all? Hey, give me a hundred rupees. You have a lot of men to feed you, They won't sponsor a dada. Whose dada? Mine. Siddhartha. Well, come along. I'll be waiting in the foyer. In my next birth, I'll be born a woman. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, all free. So late? I thought you'd not come. You seem to think a lot about me. Will you come in? Not tonight. Duli, Thanks for your support. Good night. Is the conveyance part of the package? Going too far? - Dada. Hey! What did you say? There was someone giving her lunch. And now you bring her back after dinner. Dropping her home in your car. Why don't you stop. Cushy job! And I, the world's greatest idiot... am denied a lunch. Playing the leader? Let me go. The state that you are in, a little prod will send you toppling. Will you go from here, Uncultured brute! Let's go from here, Sir. So you give me a lesson in culture! Who was it on the phone? This is no time to make a call. Runu is playing his game. Gone to Bombay to screw up my position. He doesn't know I'm not an easy nut to crack. Jyoti, Bidesh and many others... are on my side. If there's a conspiracy against me, The majority will not accept it. What's the matter? Sweating under the AC? That's what I'm doing. Hari Bose is mine. Better luck next time. There's nothing to gawk at. Just relax and go on working. What happened last night, wasn't prepared for it. Sorry. It's all right. I don't feel bad about it. Sick... Shyamal? I slept with you, the whole office been told about it. What else do you want? Money? How much do you want? Speak out. How could you think that... I would be telling about what happened between us? Don't touch me. Don't you dare touch me. I know you now inside out. How did the tour go? I came back two days ago. Now you ask me! No, You were busy. Did Duli go with you? Why would Duli go? I went by myself. Why d'you ask about Duli? No, I just thought. Shyamal, the one we didn't let come in seven years back, He is now lost for ever. Did Duli go with you? I don't know how you can generalize so promptly. Enough. You've come to me, I won't send you back empty-handed. I've come to you on a purpose, right. But, don't equate me with your other women, Please. If you put them all in the same place, won't you feel bored yourself some day? Let me tell you now what I need from you? May I come in? Come in, Oh you, come in, come in. You've done a coup. Got the couple entrapped. Wait a second, Keep it in. I've talked about your job. You'll get it. I can't relax till I've... put you on a firm foundation. There's a small matter to talk about... sit down. Sit down. Who stole sleep from my darling child's eyes? If I could catch him once! When evening falls, and children return home, and the tittie bird chirps the night long, whose sleep will the sleep-stealer steal? So you didn't understand anything? But it's quite easy to understand. The little child can't sleep. Not good for him. So what to do? We have to find out why he can't. And then take care of all those factors... What's happened now? I was telling you of the child. This is my child-my Bhalo Khoka. My brother. Scram, it's holiday for you. Come on wednesday. Don't stain the car. I knew... you burnt up my certificates. The letters I wrote to Jhinuk... You had handed over to father. I didn't say a thing to you. What's the point? I had no desire to run away and run along. I would make slow moves. Through the leaves... and let the sun warm my back. Why did you have to run and run? If you run too fast, you'll come to the end of the road soon enough, and then? Then you can't go forward, nor turn back. It's not Shyamal alone, But Runu Sanyal... Duli, and you too. Bearing your load of secrets each around a single company. There'll be a time soon when it will be too heavy. What secret do I have? I don't know exactly. But there is something. I can sense it from the night of that party. The wrinkles on your forehead have become denser. What's your husband's secret? The night he spent with Duli in the forest bungalow. What are you saying? Runu's wife had told me already that she accompanied him. So what? Going together on a business trip doesn't necessarily... A packet of contraceptives... in the pocket of his laptop bag, didn't even think of removing it. You can of course have an intimate secret, but it's awful... when you can't look at the face in the mirror eye to eye. Won't you agree? You frighten me at times, Charu. You seem to be looking deep into my self. Don't hide any secret within. Then there'll be nothing to put you into a fright. Come to the point. What do you have to tell us? If the reputation of a company is tarnished for one of us... You are taking too long. Come to the point. He is wating outside. The smell of burning is no longer there. The scar from the burn too has disappeared. All washed clean by the sunlight, the rains and the storms... over all these years. What're you thinking of? I knew there'll come a day... when the two of us, brothers, will stand together at this point on the terrace. Go ahead. Tell them. I was there that night. You mean, near the forest bungalow? Yes. I saw it all. The window was not properly closed. What did you actually see? That man was fucking Duli. Shyamal Sen. Siddhartha-babu, is it a habit of yours to roam about forests? How many forests have you been to? Didn't have the luck or the means, Sir, for such luxury. Then why were you there that day that time... before that bungalow? Call it an assignment! Whenever I'am in something, there's a deal in it. What was the deal in this case? Money? Tell me what I'm supposed to say. You told me to spill out whatever I'd seen. Now he is interrogating me. He'll stay here. Will you wait outside, Mr. Sanyal? Hey, don't teach me culture. You can't say anything you like only because you paid me. Siddhartha-babu, Will you tell us who made the deal with you? I cheated my parents. Day after day I cheated on Charu. You too... How I demeaned my self. So what? Is it a small matter, that you've become so big a man? Don't say that, dada! I can't take it. That you can shed tears like this, Shows that the good soul within you is still there. My mad little boy! There's no place for me to go to. There's no place for me to go to. Sorry to disturb you. I know you are at a board meeting. I'm putting you on the speaker mode, so that all the members of our board can thank you. I'm sorry, I have to reject your proposal. I don't get you. It's not possible for me to be your brand ambassador. But why? Because my conscience doesn't allow me to accept your offer. Put simply, I was asked for a bribe, Mr. Chatterjee. What are you looking at? I've plastered red long enough. Now it's time for green. When there's nothing else, there'll still be yellow. You are a pimp for your company. I'm one in politics. His mobile's switched off. So they asked me to bring this to him. The CMD wanted to talk to him. Please hand it over to him. Why don't you wait for a while? Then you could give it to him. No, please give it to him yourself. It's become so easy for you now. You have Hari Bose's statement. And a chargesheet to be drawn against our smart aleck, Mr. Sanyal. That's it. It's an old friendship. Though he's senior to me, friendship matters most. Money always rules, Whether you earn it or scam it. You've done a good job. It wouldn't have been possible without your assistance. Welcome home, Mr. Vice-President.
