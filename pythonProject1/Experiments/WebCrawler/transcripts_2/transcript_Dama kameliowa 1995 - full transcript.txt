Mademoiselle Marguerite Gautier? Nanine, in tears, cries. "Doctor Maleni, my madame is dying!" And you look in the pink of condition What beautiful flowers! It must be Madame Barjon as always. Please turn around, my child. Breathe, please. Now hold your breath. Yes. Well. I find you in the best shape. Keep your chin up. May I go to the opera tonight? Of course. What's playing? "Lucy of Lammermoor" A book, fully bound, gilt-edges; "Manon Lescaut" inscribed on the first page. Ten francs. Fifteen. Thirty. Thirty five. Forty. - Fifty. - Sixty. One hundred. It's yours, sir. I've made you bid ten times its worth, though. My name's Alexandre Dumas. I don't have the money on me. I'll send round for the book in an hour. Why on earth have you paid a hundred francs for what you could have got for fifteen at most? My name is Armand Duval. Excuse these clothes. I had to rush here and had no time to stop off at the hotel. Please sit down. No. thank you. I know you were at the Marguerite Gautier auction and bought "Manon Lescaut" Yes. - Do you still have it? - Of course. Could you surrender it to me? It was you who gave it to Marguerite Gautier? It was I. Take it. The book is yours. But it may be of value to you, sir. No. it's not. I knew Mademoiselle Gautier by sight only. The death of such a pretty woman made an impression on me. 1 wished to buy something at the sale. I don't know why. What did you make of the two lines I wrote on the front page? saw that the girl you had given the book to was somebody special to you. Here. Read this letter. My dear Armand. I have received your letter and thank God for it. Yes. my friend. I am ill. Mine is the illness that spares no one. You ask if I forgive you. Oh! With all my heart. The hurt you sought to do me was a token of love. I wish to leave you some- thing to remember me by. but everything I own has been seized by creditors. And nothing belongs to me. And so. my love. you will have to come to my sale and buy something. I would love you to keep "Manon Lescaut" with your dedication for yourself. Do you remember? 'Manon to Marquerite. Humility.' Armand Duval." God only knows what I made that woman suffer. how cruel I was. Brain fever. All we can do now is just pray for his young body to put up its defences. You still don't want me to write your family? Your father must be worried to death. No. I don't want him to know of my illness. I must tell you the story. You shall turn it into a book. The first time I had seen Marguerite Gautier was in the Place de la Bourse outside Susse's. What is that woman's name? She is not a woman. Seems an angel has come down from on high to buy a necklace of three dozen diamonds. What is her name? Marguerite Gautier. I wonder if you could afford such a lady. Even I couldn't dream of spending a night with her. From that day on, like a madman, I started looking for the beauty in white. That's the famous Marguerite Gautier. I know her. You know Marguerite Gautier? By sight. She's pretty, isn't she? I was sure I'd be late. Who do you think it is? Gaston! I'll go along and wish them a pleasant evening. Come up, please. Who is the other lady? Prudence Duvernoy. She had been a kept woman once; provides lovers for her, but makes exceptions. I'll recommend you to her. No, thank you. Please join us. Come, I'll introduce you to Marguerite. Ask her permission first. No need to be formal with that lady. Ask her permission to introduce me. May I introduce my friend? Sure. Bring me my sugared raisins. Certainly. How are things with the Duke? The old man may die any moment. Let's not talk about it now. I'd ditch the old geezer. I know he won't leave you a thing in his will. You don't need protectors, but lovers with big money. One more word from you and... I shut up. You did keep us waiting a long while. Monsieur Armand Duval. Monsieur Duval does not speak to you, because you have such an effect on him. He came here with you because it was tiresome for you to come alone. If you think so, I'd better take my leave. What did she say after I left? She laughed. Nothing else? Nothing. You don't take women of her kind seriously. Let me listen, please. I'll certainly see you in her box some day. She has no manners, but what a mistress she would make. Humiliated and cross with the whole world, I left Paris to discard the spell she cast on me. But soon I was back and ran to the theater like a madman. Thank you. Who's that? The Duke. Her lover? No. What is he, then? That's what the whole Paris keeps asking. I had a long talk with Dr. Maleni today. Am I to reserve a plot at the PÈre-Lachaise? He told me, "If Marguerite Gautier does not change her ways. there will be a tragedy in a matter of months." I choose the tragedy. I have to see her. All right. Let's go to her box. No. I want to meet her alone. At her home. Be reasonable. Without a notice? What if she's entertaining a caller? All right. That's what friends are for. You'll see the lady of your dreams today. You have a visitor. Let me present Monsieur Armand Duval. I've had the honor of being introduced. Two years ago, at the Opera Comique. Now I remember. You look extremely well. I've been ill. I know. I'd come to find out how you were. Was it you who used to ask after me every day? Yes, it was me. Would you have done that, Count? I have known you for only two months. And Monsieur Duval for only two minutes. About time to take my leave. When will you come again? Whenever you permit. I'll write you in a few days. Nanine, the Count. At last he's gone. He's left you a new watch. Worth at least a thousand ecus. What would you like to drink? I'd love a little punch. Let's go out for supper. No, we'll have supper here. Let's eat and drink a lot! So, it was you who came here every day? Yes. What can I do to thank you? Allow me to call on you from time to time. Certainly. As often as you like. between five and six... ...and from eleven to midnight. Why can't I ever play this part? To hell with Chopin! They say he has consumption too. You shouldn't get nervous. Let's have supper! I'm starving! ♪ In Provence, ♪ ♪ Each wench has got ♪ ♪ At least two nipples ♪ ♪ And two hearts. ♪ Come. You haven't seen round the apartment. I'd rather you didn't act funny. come tomorrow. When nobody will disturb us. Didn't I tell you don't want you? Bravo, Gaston! Nanine, don't answer the door. You sit on my right and Monsieur on my left. My friends, here's a riddle! What is love? Oh no! It's so down-to-earth. Can you guess? What is love? I've never given it much thought. I take life the way it is. Well, love is... You are killing yourself. There's no cure for this illness. Don't bother about me. How pale I look. Let's go back to the table. What's the matter? What I've just seen hurts me. A woman who coughs blood and spends three hundred thousand francs a year is good for a rich old man like the Duke. I'm quickly abandoned by young lovers. I love you. I love... Why don't you love me like an old friend? And don't you overvalue me. What can I do to acknowledge your love? Please love me a little. Will you accept me the way I am? Yes. When will I see you again? When the camellias are a different color. When will that be? Tomorrow, between eleven and midnight. Don't you think it strange that I could give myself to you at once? As I shall not live long. I want to live faster. Don't you... Don't talk to me like this! Please close the window. I feel cold. Would you like me to go and leave you to sleep? You can tell me the end of the story later. - Am I boring? - On the contrary. Please stay. I won't sleep if you go. went home after I talked with Marguerite. And dreamed impossible dreams of her physical and spiritual salvation. of spending the rest of my life by her side. Full of hope. I ran to the rue d'Antin. Is Mademoiselle Gautier home? She's never back before eleven. Good evening. Good evening. Oh! It's you! You said I could come and call on you tonight. So I did. I'd forgotten. Come. Follow me. If anyone comes, say I'm not back. Come. What news have you got to tell me? I think I was wrong to come here. Why? I seem to be boring you. No. You're not boring me. Only I'm ill. I have not been well all day. I haven't slept and I have a terrible headache. Do you want me to leave? No, you can stay. Who the deuce can that be? Certainly, there's nobody to answer the door. Please wait. I'll be right back. How are you this evening? Ill. - Am I disturbing you? - Yes. Have I done anything wrong? No. I'm tired and want to go to bed early. Will you be so kind as to go away? Thank you. Show the Count a light. Please give it to Mademoiselle Gautier. Thank you. Madame! The Count has left jewelry again. - Put it... - Where? Wherever you please! From today on tell the Count that I'm not in, or, that I don't want to see him again. I think I should be going now. Nanine! Undress me! Get some punch ready. It will make you ill. So much the better. And bring chicken, pÂtÉ, and some fruit. I'm hungry. Why don't you take it off? You're going to have supper with me. Read a book now and wait for me. You don't mind if I lie down? Come and sit by me and we'll talk. Will you forgive me my being bad-tempered? I forgive you everything. Do you love me? Yes. In spite of my awful temper? In spite of everything. The bordeaux will do better than punch. - Is that right, sir? - Quite right. Go to bed. We won't need you. Should I lock the front door? Yes. No one is to be admitted before noon. Forgive me if I shoo you away. The Duke will bring me my pay in a moment. When will I see you again? This is the key to the side door. I've never given it to anyone. Keep it. - Forever? - Yes. So you love me a little? I don't know how it is. but it seems that I do. Armand, calm down. Who's that? Today's Thursday Count de Giray. I must talk to her. Be reasonable, Monsieur. Your allowance of seven thousand francs a year won't even cover the upkeep of her carriage. You have the sweetest mistress in Paris. She receives you like a king free of charge. And you're still not satisfied. My friend, don't take it to heart. Do you hear me? She might have sent the Count home by now. In a month from now, I'll be free, won't have any debts and we'll spend the summer in the country. I cover the expenses. So the Count will pay for our happy moments. I thought you loved me. I was wrong. As you wish. I'm jealous even of your every thought. I love you and you shouldn't worry at least about where my money comes from. In a month, we will stroll in the fields, drink milk... Untie my bodice. This life in Paris is killing me. I won't tell you I'm a colonel's daughter raised in Saint Denis. A country girl, I couldn't sign my name 6 yrs.ago. You're the first man with whom I share it. I've been to the country many times, but never the way I should have liked. I trust I'll be happy there with you. A letter for you, sir. Dear Armand, I'm hot very well. The doctor has told me to rest. Much to my regret, I won't see you. Come tomorrow. I love you. - Who d'you want to see? - Mademoiselle Gautier. She's not back yet. I'll wait. She told me not to let anybody in. Dear Marguerite, I trust your indisposition is gone now. Count de Giray must have proved to be a good doctor. Forgive me the boring moments with me. I will never forget the happy moments owe you. I am returning the key, which may be of use if you are ever ill as you were yesterday. Sincerely yours, Armand Duval. Please close the door. Why did you deceive me? If I were a duchess and had two hundred thousand francs a year... were your mistress and had another lover, you might say I deceived you. I'm Marguerite Gautier. a paid prostitute. I love you madly. Marguerite. Why don't you love me a little less and understand a little better? Once my little dog looked at me sadly when I coughed. It was the only creature I have loved... cried more after his death than after my mother's. You, seeing me cough blood, were the only human being who ever felt sorry for me Marguerite! Destroy the letter! I've brought it back to you. The next day I sent her the book with the dedication. The word 'Humility' meant that from now on I would accept all humiliating situations. Soon the Count rented for her a house in the country. I'll sell everything and we'll settle in Italy. Nobody there knows whom I was. Or no... Why spend money at all? I cost you here quite a lot anyway. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. This stormy weather makes me irritable. Marguerite! Armand! I've brought you a visitor. Madame Julie... My dear! I'm so glad to see you. This is Madame Julie Dupart, my first madam. And this is Armand. Nanine! Take those baskets in. I've brought you some wine, cake, and cheese. And some champagne as always. You're slim, my child, but with a nice complexion. You've wanted to see me, honey? I've wanted to tell you I am happy. Really happy. for the first time. We'll have champagne to drink to it. To your new life, Marguerite! To you, sir! Be good to her and show understanding. The last coach to Paris seems to have left. What do we do now? Don't worry. I'll give you my carriage. It might be cold at night. Could you lend me your golden shawl? Certainly. Armand! Champagne again! To your happiness, my dear hosts! Why hasn't Prudence returned your carriage? I forgot to tell you about a letter from her. One horse is sick and the carriage needs repairs. And your shawl? I can do without it. You'll make me warm when I'm cold. Where are Marguerite's horses? Sold. - Her shawl? - Sold. - The diamonds? - Pawned. Marguerite ordered me and Julie to do it. - The money is spent. - On what? Paying debts. I'll pay your debts to get back the horses, shawls, diamonds you need to lead your life. - You don't love me. - Are you mad? You see me as a tart you have to pay. All right. You sign away all you have and you'll be my keeper. How long? A month or two and then what? See me return to my protectors? Have I run away only to come back again? Is it true you live with Marguerite Gautier? Yes. Do you know what she was? A kept woman, father. - You love her very much? - Yes, I do. I don't approve of this relationship. You will leave your mistress. Out of the question. I beg you in the memory of your mother. Renounce this life you are leading. I beg you to return to your family. Rest and family love will cure you. Your mistress will get over it. She'll take another lover. Father, you don't know Marguerite. She's the noblest human being. That hasn't stopped her pocketing all your money. The sixty thousand francs your mother left you is all the money you have. Who told you I want to give her the money? My solicitor. Mother left it to you but not to give it away to your mistresses. Marguerite knows nothing of this gift. She's sacrificed everything to live with me. I don't understand. And you have accepted this sacrifice? What sort of man are you to allow her to make any sacrifices for you? My goodness! A while ago I asked you; now I order you: Pack your things and get ready to come with me. - I shall not leave here. - Why not? I don't have to obey orders at my age. You've taken leave of your senses. Go to Paris and talk to your father. I don't want you to quarrel with your family. Tell him you don't care so much about me. I'll say nothing of the kind. Did you hear? The first storm this autumn. What's the matter? Why are you crying? I was afraid you wouldn't return. Don't you want to know if I've seen him? Have you? No.He left me a letter at the hotel. Here. Read it. I hate to read other people's letters. Father writes, "Wait for me until four. If I'm not back, come and dine with me tomorrow. I must speak with you." I was there at four. but father did not show up. Has your mistress received any letters? No. - Any visitors? - None. What time is it? Two o'clock. You awake? I can't sleep. Come to me. Have you decided to go to Paris tomorrow? Yes. I'm leaving early morning to see my father. - Will you come back? - Of course. Promise me you'll come back for sure. Why? I told you I'll be back. Of course, you will. I'll be waiting and we'll be as happy as ever. I can't leave you when you're ill. I'll write him. I'll write... No, there's no need. Go! I've thought it over. Seems every young man needs a mistress. You'd better be her lover than some other woman's. Oh, thank you, father. God, You have answered my prayers. Marguerite will be happy. So you really love her? To distraction. In that case, go to her. - Where's your mistress? - She has left. - Where? - For Paris. - When? - An hour after you. And didn't say anything? Not a word. Would you like to eat, sir? - Who do you want, sir? - Marguerite Gautier. Ma demoiselle is not back yet. Was she here during the day? Yes, with Madame Duvernoy. - And then? - Got into a carriage. - What carriage? - A private one. - She left a message? - Yes. A letter for you. "By the time you read this letter, I'll be another man's mistress. All is finished between us. Go back to your father, to your sister. I'm in your debt for my only happy moments." What happened? This is a letter from Marguerite. You see for yourself. I'm taking you home. Your sister's love and mine will help you get over it. Having returned to Paris, I decided she should pay for what I had suffered. Welcome, sir. I'm so glad to see you. Thank you for your invitation. Are you enjoying the party? Very much. Are you still in love with Marguerite? No. Ladies and gentlemen. Grand Valse! Shall we dance? I was expecting you'd ask me. - Three. - Five. - Ten. One hundred for me. - It's my lead. One hundred. Another hundred. You've lost? Yes. Everything? Yes. And I've won three hundred louis. Take it. It's yours. What do you mean? Because I love you. Not so. You're in love with Marguerite and want to have your revenge. You may tell her her decision was right. How much is it? Three hundred louis. Only for tonight. Please help me undress. This is to your divine legs, Olympe! I wish they'd serve you well when I'm gone. Don't drink so much. Did you dance the whole time with Monsieur Duval? - I'd better go. - Are you in a hurry? It must be an important appointment. Exactly. And who's the lucky man? Armand Duval. After our fabulous night, he asked me to tell you how grateful he was for your right decision. In that case, This is to your happiness. Yours. ...and Monsieur Armand Duval's. You don't have a heart. Get out of my house! You will make that tart apologize to me, or all is finished between us! Write to her in the most insulting way. I won't spares the ink, believe me. It is mean of you. You're ruled by a heartless woman. Marguerite is ill and she is coughing. She won't live long. Come and see her. I have no wish to meet Count de Giray. If Marguerite wants to see me, she can come here. You wanted to see me. I came. You've hurt me a great deal, I never did anything to you. Never did anything? Nothing. Except what circumstances forced me to do to you. I have two requests: Forgive me for what I said to Olympe yesterday. Don't do anything you're planning to do to me. A good mam doesn't take revenge on an ill woman. I have a fever... I left my bed not to ask you for your friendship, but for indifference I suffered too when, after a few hours, I came to Paris only to find that cruel letter. Op How could you have deceived me? I didn't come here to speak about that. In spite of all, I still love you. And I want you to stay with me. I wonder if it's possible? I will forget everything and we'll be happy as we promised we would. All right. Please stay with me. Stay! I'm sorry. Madame can not see you now. Count de Giray is with her. Of course, I'd forgotten. You left so quickly this morning that I forgot to pay you. I enclose your rate for a night. Armand Duval. A messenger has brought a letter. He must give it to Monsieur Duval in person. Do I have the honor to speak to Monsieur Duval? You do. Here you are, sir. Who gave you this letter? A lady who was leaving on the Boulogne mail coach. Told me not to bring it until the coach has left. Madame left for England tonight at six. There was nothing to keep me in Paris. Neither hate nor love. One of my friends was about to go to the Middle East. I decided to keep him company. I boarded a ship at Marseilles. This is what Madame Julie Duprat kept for me. I have been ill for a month. I need your respect. That's why I've been writing this journal and won't stop until my strength leaves me. I'm ill and there is no one with me here. I think of you, Armand. I always had a feeling I would die young. Don't want to die without telling you the truth. When you left for Paris, your father wasn't home, because he went to visit me. Here are the pawn tickets and receipt for the items I have sold or pawned not to be a burden for Armand to bear. I will make any sacrifice only to save our love. My child... Life is cruel to our hearts. but me must submit. I believe you are a noble-hearted woman. But... I have not told you everything. I have a daughter. She's about to marry the man she loves. But the parents of my would-be son-in-law have found out about Armand's relationship with a courtesan. And declared that until Armand changes his ways, they will withdraw their consent. The future of a child who has never harmed you is in your hands. Do you have the right to destroy the future of my child? Marguerite! In the name of your love for Armand! Please... Please save my daughter's happiness. Do you believe that I love Armand? Yes. Do you believe that my love is not selfish? Yes. Do you believe that his love is the only dream I have? My only hope? The only chance for redemption? Yes. Then kiss me once as you would kiss your daughter. I swear that your son will return to you. Unhappy. perhaps, but cured forever. I have come to Madame to get my money back. Mademoiselle Gautier is very ill. You shouldn't hide like a rat in the hole. I've brought the bills. If I don't receive cash in three days, I should send a bailiff here. 20 December The weather is dreadful. So high a fever that I'm hardly able to write. I'm off to the pawnshop. You have a list of items? The Duke has not answered me. You shouldn't have burned all the bridges. I have a court order to seize all goods I find on the premises. Here are the papers. Let me in! How dare you?! They've come to repossess everything. Are you Mademoiselle Marguerite Gautier? Yes. It is I. We have a repossession order for everything we find on the premises. I can't believe it! You mean now? That woman is seriously ill! You don't have a heart! Don't disturb the gentleman. He's doing his duty. You have nine days in which to appeal. After I make notes of all the goods distrained, I'll leave a watchman here according to the law. I am dying. That was to be expected. I never thought one can suffer more than I suffer. You should get much rest. Stay in bed longer. Yes, doctor. And avoid... ...strong emotions How long will I last? I refuse to answer silly questions. You should believe in your recovery as I believe in it. Will you? Please. Yes, I will. And don't you write that journal. Memories only make the fever worse. Unfortunately. your illness has been progressing. I'll come tomorrow. See what I've got? A letter from Armand's father. "Madame. I have just learned that you are ill. If I were in Paris. I should call on you. My son would do it too, if he were here. But Armand is far away. A friend of mine will call on you. Monsieur Hardcourt. Please receive him." I'm so happy. So happy. Thank you very much, but I can't accept the money. Your refusal should offend Monsieur Duval. He asked me to provide anything you need. Please thank Monsieur Duval for his concern. I don't need anything. Thank you. If you were by my side, Armand. I should get better. But what's the point of getting better? Good morning, Marguerite. You look much better today. Will you bleed me again? It's necessary for a quick recovery. Is it possible for me to get better? Yes, it is possible. Put your hope in the Lord, my angel. You shouldn't have estranged the Duke. Why doesn't she write another letter to him? I'll go and make her come to her senses. What have you put into your handbag? Why did you do it? Armand! It is I, Gaston. I knew you'd come. Camellias. Please put them in the vase. I have good news for you. From Armand? Your worry's over. I've paid off the bailiff. No more trouble. The watchman's dismissed. How can I ever repay your kindness? Your recovery will be my best reward. Have you seen all those presents in the drawing room? Sometimes, it seems so funny there are still some men who hope I will be their mistress later on. What did Dr.Maleni say? It's a matter of days. I'll come again tomorrow. Should we send for a priest? Yes. Bring the one from the Church of Saint Roche. I am happy for you, Armand. to be somewhere under the warm skies rather than feel the icy weight upon your breast... Cast of Characters
