(GROWLING) I'm ready for pro ball right now, understand me? Hey, Hey, easy, easy, bro. Motivation... A little motivation. All right, all right. Hey, Courtney. I could use a personal bodyguard, huh? Very personal. Guess you must have heard about my full football scholarship to B.C.? Who's the man! That's right! Good for you. Glad you'll be doing something with your life after graduation. Yeah right. I kinda pictured you as my babe. You know, sitting up there in the alumni stadium, watching me run the show, huh? I would like that... If I was you... Yeah, well, how about I'm the quarterback and you're watching me from the stands? Whoa. You got the you and me right or the me and you... Anyway, you got it backwards, is what I'm saying. The me and you though, is good... Spare me, Rocco. Well, I'll be making a lot more money than that geek-ball boyfriend of yours, that nerd, Ryan, right? What is he? He ain't no football player. Excuse me. I need to work out. Come on, Courtney. You know I'm the one for you. You know I'm the one. I'm the one! Forget it, forget it. You know what? You think that you're better than me and my brother. You and your friend, you think you're too good. Come on. Relax, man. You're nothing, all right? Hey. Relax, man. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on, let's get out of here, Rocco. I'll show you who's who. Let's get out of here, all right? Relax. All right, Squirt, I'll be in the library if you need me. Okay, Mom. I'm just going to sit here and surf. Okay. See ya. Sam? Hi, Billy. You in-lining again? Online. You should just enroll yourself in this school. Okay, ready for some baseball trivia? All right. American League Batting Champ. '63, '67 and '68. (SIGHS) Our favorite team. Mr. Yaz... Carl Yastrzemski! Go Sox! You know something about him? He had this high stance, way up. Then down and whack! Out the park! (LAUGHS) (GROANS) Don't ever get old, Sam. You need some help? I can manage. It's okay, I need a break anyway. (DOOR CLATTERS) (SHUSHING) All right. Look, look, it's very simple. Hello! Paying attention? Look. Hmm? What? No power, no play. We got the power! We got the power! That's right, all right. Go, go! Unplug them all. (IN SING-SONG) We got the power. We got the power. Hey! Come here, come here. Listen, listen. All right, here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna take one of these computers here, right? I'm a genius! I'm a genius! All right, look, we're going to take this computer, and then tomorrow, we step up and we say we saw Courtney's geek-ball boyfriend take the computer, huh? Then he'll get busted! All right, get this one. Let's take two! How you doing? (BOTH SCREAMING) That kid, he saw me! We gotta... We gotta get this kid! Ah! There he is, there he is! (LAUGHS) Where you going now, kid? You ain't going nowhere! Come on over here. Leave me alone! Oh, you are so dead. We got you now. We got you now, yeah. We got you now! I got you now, come here. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hold on, now! Don't do that. Whoa! Whoa! Hang on a second. Wait. (ALARM BLARING) I'll break you all up! I'll break you all up! I'll get you, kid! PRINCIPAL: You see who it was? Sam. You're telling the truth? I've got to know, Son. Well, I heard the name Rocco. Rocco? Rocco Firelli? That... That can't be. He's got a football scholarship to Boston College. Why would he do this? You sure you heard that name? Well, he had a football tattoo. Football tattoo? Yeah, and it said... Eagle... Eagles Rule. We'll check into this. If what you're saying is true, Sam, I'll need you to be a witness. Sam, listen to me. If you saw this boy, you need to speak up. But I don't want to, Dad. Sam, vandalism is a very serious problem. If he did this, we could use your help. Boy, this is a tough one. I mean, I wish we could help him in some way. Is it our fault? I mean, the schools aren't even safe anymore. Honey, where is it safe anymore? I don't know. I'll tell you where it's safe. It's safe out in the country, that's where it's safe. Dad, I've... I've decided to testify. I know it's the right thing to do. You feel comfortable with your decision? I'm scared, but I'll do it. Well, I gotta tell you, your mom and I are very proud of you. What's up? Sam's going to do it. He's going to testify. Cool! Rocco's a jerk. Hey, Dad and I have been talking about, maybe, moving out of the city. What do you two think? Yeah! No way! We can't move. I'm in high school. No, your mom and I are just talking. I'm... I'm not going anywhere. JUDGE: Young man, you've been found guilty of vandalizing school property. You're talented. You have a bright future, but not if you continue making bad choices. A football scholarship is nothing to throw away. I sentence you to restitution to the school for its loss, and to six months community service. This hearing is adjourned. Hey, Sam. What's up? Nice mountain bike! Thanks. It's a birthday present and it rips. Let's go. (ENGINE IDLING) (BRAKES SCREECHING) You're going to kill them. Let's go, stop screwing around! Look, we're going to get him, all right! Just relax! Go get my dad. I'll be right back. So, I'm going to get this kid right now. (SCREAMING) (SAM SCREAMING) Whoo! Yeah! We got him, baby! My God, is he dead? You killed him. We're in trouble now! Let's go! Let's go! You never listen to me. I told you, now we're going to get in trouble! (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Why would anyone do this to me, Dad? Buddy, I don't know. Do you have insurance? No, I don't. Well, then I have to do the paperwork. I understand. (DEVICE BLEEPS) Um, it's been declined. Do you have another card? No, I don't have another one. Are you sure? That's what it says. You can apply for Medicaid. No, thank you. I don't want any handouts. What's wrong? The card is maxed out. Gary, I don't know if we have enough to cover the rent this month. I know I can pick up some extra hours at work. Do you think you could get an advance from that building contract? Marilyn, I lost that bid this morning. There is no building contract. I'm sorry. You remember what we spoke about the other day? Mmm. Yeah? Mmm. Let's do it. Let's get outta here. Let's go somewhere where we can really live. Where we just don't exist from month to month. Where, Gary? I don't know, anywhere. Somewhere. (SNICKERS) Maybe we can go somewhere where kids are kind to each other. You know, where kids can be kids. We'll buy a house. With what? Well, I'll cash in the pension. It's hardly a fortune. We don't need a fortune. I mean, we just need enough to put a down payment on a home. Oh, God, Dad. Please, please tell me this isn't it. (LAUGHING) This is it. The center of town. Great, so where's the mall? Well, I think there's one in Burlington. That's the largest city. That a boy! Cool! You like it? Yeah? Did you see the backyard? Well, what do you think? It's beautiful. Is it really ours? Yeah, it's really ours. Awesome! That's right, Squirt, it is. Too bad it's not yours. I found it first. Yes, you did. Thanks. Hey, but I found it first! I know. I don't care! It's not fair. But, it's mine! Shut up, Sam! But, how come you get it? Because I'm older. This is cool, too. (SPITS) Flatlanders, Mack. What they gonna do? Ain't no health spas around here. Okay, slow... Hey! Hey, you folks need some help? Yeah, that would be great. Thank you. Okay, just curious. (LAUGHING) Hardly a friendly reception. Well, I'm sure they'll come around. Delores always loved that house. (SIGHS) (MUSIC PLAYING ON HEADPHONES) Courtney? Courtney? Courtney! Courtney, I've been calling you for five minutes. Do you want to help? I need you to go to Eagle Rock for me. Right now? Well, if you want to eat now. Mom, I can't go anywhere, I just painted my toenails. Dry them! Mom, that will totally ruin the finish, and besides, it's so far away. I'm not walking 20 minutes. Oh, what a tragedy! Can't you just send Sam? Please? Okay, I'll ask Sam, but next time it's your turn. Can you tell him to get some frozen yogurt? Anything else, your highness? Is that him? Yeah. BOY: Looks like a real dork. Yeah, tell me about it. Hi! (BELLS TINKLING) I need these things for my mom, please. What's your name? Sam... Sam Docherty. I'm Dennis. You must be the new kid, huh? Yeah. Well, welcome to Woodfield, Sam... Sam Docherty, huh? Let's go. All right, milk... (DOG BARKS) Whoa! Where'd you come from? Go on home now, boy. Hey, quit following me! Are you hungry? I guess Mom won't mind if I give you just one. Hey! Hey, those are my hotdogs. I'm in so much trouble! Hey, greedy! Um... Hi! Where do you think you're going, Wimp? Hey, look! The new girl's been shopping, aw! I'm not a girl. You are, if we say you are! Hey, man. What you got in there? Aw, poor baby! Why don't you just go back home? This is my home. No, it's not! You come here, you take our houses and you take our jobs! That's not why we moved here! (BOYS EXCLAIMING EXCITEDLY) What are you going to do about that? (BARKING) You mangy mutt! (BOYS SCREAMING) Sam, what happened? I fell. You fell? You fell where? On the street. I tripped. How did you get egg in your hair? Dad, I fell on the groceries. I was running... I tripped. Just believe me, okay? Okay, you go wash up and I'll make you something to eat. Look on the bright side, Sam. Eggs have a lot of protein, they're good for your hair. That's all right, ma'am. I've got that for you. Oh! I'm just so used to having to pump my own gas. Thank you. You're very welcome, ma'am. Will you fill it up for me, please? You got it. Hi, there. So, you new in town, huh? Wow, a regular neurosurgeon. I guess it's hard not to notice when someone moves into a hick town that has a population of five. We've got a few more than that. Oh, yeah, six, is it? Well, it depends if you count the cows. Oh, and a comedian! Well, if you need someone to show you around, I'd be more than happy to. I've got eyes. I can show myself around, thank you. Certainly are pretty eyes. (DOOR SHUTS) You have a nice day, now! You, too! He is nice. And kind of cute, too. Nosy, more like it. Hey, by the way, my name's Judd! Who asked? (BARKING) Thanks for chasing those bullies away. Don't you belong to anybody? Don't you even have a name? I think I'll call you Chaser! You like that name? (BOYS SHOUTING EXCITEDLY) I'm getting it! I'm getting it! Get out of the way! I've got to reel him in, you slug! (SHOUTING EXCITEDLY) Yes! I'm the king of the world. And I'm falling in the mud. But I got the tuna! What am I going to do with you, Chaser? You don't have any place to go. I'd like to keep you, but I'd have to ask my folks. Wait for me here. Mom? Hey, Sam! Mom, can I ask you something? Sure, what is it? Well, I, kind of, made a new friend today. That's great, Sam! Where? Just outside. Can he stay with us? For lunch? Well, yeah, and forever. Oh, Sam, he's such a cutie! Can we please keep him, Mom? He's got nowhere else to go. Keep who? Okay. Come on! Come on. Hi. Mr. Burns? He's up there. Mr. Burns! Thank you. Good morning. Gary Docherty. Looks like you've got a great set up here. I'm looking forward to getting my hands dirty. Mr. Docherty, we've got a little problem. There have been some changes. We no longer have the need for a foreman. Well, I thought I already had the job, sir. Business is slow. There's nothing I can do. It's out of my hands. Wait! Let's slow down a minute, here. This company promised me a job. I moved my family up here from Boston. We never had a contract, Mr. Docherty. Mr. Burns! I would be willing to accept a lower position. I wish I had one. I really am sorry. Where you want this, Jim? JIM: Over here! New foreman? A buddy of mine since junior high. It's not the end of the world, honey. (VEHICLE APPROACHING) There you are, y'all! Hello! Welcome to Woodfield. I would have come over straight away, but I thought I'd let you folks settle in. Hope you like the pie. It is just a little welcome gesture. I bake them all the time, especially when we have the annual town fair. I always have a pie booth there every year. They seem to go over nicely. (WHIMPERING) I give all my money to the church. (INAUDIBLE) Dad! Dad, we washed Chaser today. Doesn't he look great? He looks good, buddy. He said you look great, pal. Well, you do. Yeah! Go ahead! Wow, you should be in the Red Sox outfield. Oh, no! Come on. Let's go hide! Get out of there, boy. You hear me? If you're going to hide from me, don't hide behind poison ivy! See those red leaves? That's a warning sign. They says, "Don't come near me, don't touch me, else you'll itch like crazy"! Now why you playing on your own? Haven't you made any friends? No, not yet. Well, we can be friends. Come on! Hop on. Help me pick some corn. See, see, you want to find the one with the dry, dark brown silk. They're the ripe ones. And then, you just get a firm grip and yank hard. Okay? Pick as many as you want. There. (SCREAMING) Sam! I'll bring the tractor around so we can load it on the wagon! No, Chaser, this one's rotten. (GASPS) (CHASER WHINING) Chaser! Chaser! He just came from nowhere! Chaser. It's holistics, Sam. Herbals, you know, it's just... There you go. This little pup is going to be robo-dog before you know it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry, Sam. Dennis will fix him up. He takes care of all the animals here. Good morning, guys! Mmm. Hey, man, how we doing, huh? Hey, pal. Want some, Dad? Uh, no. Thanks. Where's mom? I don't know. She left early this morning. Yeah? You guys want to go get some breakfast? No? All right. Morning. DENNIS: You got a customer. Marilyn, don't you think you could have mentioned this to me? It's no biggie, Gary, just something to hold us over. Ain't it something, Mack, how some folks come all the way up here just to waitress? Yep, I guess it's easier just to live off the old lady. (LAUGHTER) Hey, waitress! Can we get our pancakes? You know, like sometime today? There you go, gentlemen, nice and hot. Took long enough. (COUGHING) Hi, hon. I didn't tell you because I know you would have said... Quit the job, Marilyn. Exactly! I don't want you anywhere near those people. You bought a house across the street from those people, Gary. I made a mistake. I want to work. Work for what? Nickels and dimes? Those nickels and dimes will pay some bills. I will get something soon. I know you will. Then quit! No! (SIGHS) (BELL DINGING) (INAUDIBLE) Your new boyfriend, huh? Shut up, Sam. Mr. Docherty! Shame Marilyn couldn't make it today. Well, she has a job. I prayed for you. Something will turn up! I appreciate that. Good morning, Mr. Burns! Have you met my neighbor? Good morning! Yes, we've met. Wonderful! Mr. Docherty! I wasn't honest with you about the job. I was pressured into hiring a local Joe. Well, I hope he's working out. Look, I know someone who needs an extra hand. Hi. Hey. Shake. Shake. Shake. Yeah! Good boy. Here. High-five! Yeah! Speak! Speak! (BARKS) Yeah! Yeah! That's good! (DOOR OPENING) (CHASER PANTING) They're kissing again, Chaser, I guess that means they've made up. BOY 1: See? What did I tell you guys? She's beautiful! Wow. BOY 2: I wonder how old she is? Too old for you, chumps! You're the chump! I can't do this anymore, Sam. I'm too hot. Why don't you go play with those guys? Did you see that? She looked at me! Dream on! She looked at me. I think not, geek-ball! I'll play with Chaser. Hey, maybe if we're nice to him, we'll get to meet her. Hey! (BARKING) What's up? Hey, we're sorry about the other day. We were just messing around. My name's Gill. I'm Joel. Yeah, and, uh, this is Slim. Can't you tell? My name's really Danny. Hi, I'm Sam. So, you want to come hang out with us? You want to see the sumo ring? What's that? GILL: Come on, we'll show you. Well, don't you want to be friends with us? Well, come on. (WHINES) Ahhh! (SHOUTING GIBBERISH) Konichiwa! Welcome to Woodfield Square Gardens for World Sumo Championship! Gill- san! Fatso- san! (LAUGHING) Ahhh! Samurai! (ALL SHOUTING) Gill- san! (SHOUTING EXCITEDLY) (BOTH SHOUTING GIBBERISH) Until next time. Ah, kemosabe! I am the Great Slim-o! (LAUGHING EVILLY) (SPEAKS GIBBERISH) I played with that new kid today, Dad. Huh? That new kid. I hung out with him today. I don't want you hanging around that kid. You don't know nothing about him. You got your own buddies. You just stick with them. You hear me? Huh? Yeah. All right. Ah! My dad said Boston is nothing but a dive with lots of crime. No, it's not! It's got museums, colleges, and a great baseball team! So what? And an ocean! Wow! You ever swim at the beach? All the time. I wish I could do that. Why? You can't even swim. I can swim. You're the one who can't. Bull! I swim. Well, I've never seen you. Well, there's a lot of things you've never seen me do! Man, why do you want to swim anyway? You'd friggin' sink with all that fat, doughboy! Liar! You can't swim. My mom taught me, loser! How come I don't see your mom? She died. She was an alcoholic. Don't you ever say that about my mom! I didn't mean anything by it, Gill! Just chill, dude! Come on! Stop! Quit it! Gill, I'm sorry, man. Get lost! Gill, come on. Gill, I was just telling him what happened. Gill, I'm sorry, man. Well, this is it. Where are we going? You'll see. Yeah, you'll see. Oh, yeah. Yeah, man, uh, this is giving me the creeps. (SHUDDERS) If you leave, you're out forever. Whoa! Whoa! (GROANING) Wait, guys! Wait! What's that? Witches. Yeah, they live in the woods. No, they don't! Witches aren't real. Everyone knows witches are real! And don't get too close! Come on, guys. Let's get going. Hey, you wouldn't want to be left up here alone. Right, Joel? No. People disappear up here all the time. Yep. Shut up, guys! Slim! SAM: That's not real. GILL: What? You scared? No. Spider-saurus. (SCOFFS) Come on, let's go. (CROW CAWING) (EXHALING) Here it is. Let's do it. Let's do what? We're going in. Why? Why not? You chicken? Chicken! I ain't chicken! If you want to be our friends, we're gonna go in. But Gill, man, I don't want to go in either. Man, come on! (SCREAMING) (CREAKING) Ahhh! Ahhh! (BARKING) (BOYS MIMICKING CHICKENS) SLIM: (LAUGHING) That was cool! Catch? Yeah. Yeah! Come on! Right here! (GLASS SHATTERING) Dad is gonna kill me! Learn to catch, Sumo! I tried, but, I mean, he threw it too high. Well then, jump, Fatso! Yeah, donut boy! (SCREAMING) Food's ready, Dad. All right. So, uh, how is it? I'm a pretty good cook, huh? This town is so boring. Things will pick up when school starts. I can't even go to the movies, it's so far, Mom. I'll take you this weekend. As soon as I turn 18, I'm gone. Back to civilization. Before you head back to civilization, this weekend I will take you to Burlington, we'll go to the mall and I'll take you to a movie. Oh, rad! city! Going to the mall with my whole family. Why don't I just write "I'm a loser" across my face with a red pen? Courtney, why do you complain about everything? This is my summer vacation, Mom, I'm entitled to have some fun, you know. Besides, I don't complain about everything. And I'm so glad that Chaser has eaten more than I have tonight. MACK: Hey! Hey! Your boy broke my window. He did? That's what I just said. Hey, Sam! Come here for a minute, buddy! This man says you, uh, broke his window. He did with a baseball. My boy saw him. Dad, I didn't do anything. You saying my son's a liar? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's back up a minute, all right? You sure you got your facts straight? I didn't do it, Dad. Honest. You're lying. Sam, go on inside. Finish your dinner. Don't you ever call my son a liar again. You know, I'm getting a little sick and tired of your attitude. Oh, you are? What's going on here, Gary? Your boy broke my window. He says he didn't do it, but I got three witnesses. Just give us the bill, we'll pay for it. You'll get it. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Hey. You okay? Hmm? It's been a rough day, Dad. I didn't break the window. I know that. I know that. But maybe next time, you really ought to break it, huh? Get our money's worth. I don't like it here. We can't leave, can we? No, Son, we can't. This is our home now. Look, Sam, I don't know if this will help or not, but I kind of know what you're feeling, because I've been there. When I was a couple of years younger than you, your grandpa, my dad, moved us to Boston, right next door to this real troublemaker. And this kid introduced himself to me the first day by picking a fight, and bloodying my nose. Yeah, nice, huh? Anyway, this troublemaker, you know what his name was? Bob Daily. Uncle Bobby? Yeah! Uncle Bobby. You could still be friends with him after that? Best friends, Sam. Best friends today. Look, like I said, I don't know if that helps or not, but hang in there, okay? I'm sure things are going to be just great. All right, why don't you and Chaser get your, uh, P.J.'s on. Get ready for bed and I'll see you in the morning. Deal? I love you, pal. Good night. Good night, Dad. All right, let's settle down. Welcome back, everyone. I'm sure you all enjoyed your summer break, but now it's back to business. I am Mr. Grisham and this is the 7th grade. I know I recognize a lot of your faces from last year, but there is one face I don't recognize, uh, Sam Docherty. Would you stand up, please? Come on, Earth to Sam Docherty. Uh, why don't you... (LAUGHING) (ALL LAUGHING) Sam, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself? Well, uh, maybe after you've had a chance to settle in? You may be seated. Okay, everybody, open your books, page 73... MRS. MARSDON: If you're going to hide from me, don't hide behind poison ivy! See those red leaves? That's a warning sign. They says, "Don't come near me, don't touch me, else you'll itch like crazy"! (TV PLAYING) (CHANNEL CHANGES) Hey! Aren't you going to practice your tai chi today? Why do you care? Oh, I thought I saw that guy, Judd driving by. So? Yes! (BOYS GROANING) Head lice! (LAUGHING) Shut up! Shut up! (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) (SHRIEKING) (STUDENTS LAUGHING) (CAROUSEL MUSIC PLAYING) JUDD: Hey, you guys go ahead. I'll catch up with you later, all right? You want to do this? Nope. Hey! How you doing? Hi. Hey. Judd. Sam. I was, uh, hoping I'd see you here. I wanted to talk to you in school, but, you know... So, you ever do any shooting? No. Take a turn? (INAUDIBLE) Try and look right down the sight. Go ahead, try! Could you show me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, just, um... Um... Uh, just squeeze the trigger. Don't pull it. There you go! I hit it! Wasn't so hard! All right, let me show you, man. Sam, you want to aim down the barrel and squeeze the trigger, don't pull it. Ready? Hold it steady, right down the line. There you go! See, that wasn't so hard. MAN: Nice shot, kid. JUDD: That one? Yeah. That's a good one. Thanks. MAN: Here you go. Thanks. Sure. (INAUDIBLE) Sam, why don't you go get some cotton candy or something? I'm broke. Enjoy the fair and be home by 6:00, okay? I know when I'm not wanted! (INAUDIBLE) We can blow something up! Cool! We should trash something! Let's go! Guys, we gotta get some fried dough! GILL: Man, you don't need fried dough! JOEL: Slim, come on! SLIM: Come on! Gonna fix her up, get new seats, new paint job. I got it for 200 bucks actually, from this old guy. You don't want to hear details. No, it's, um, it's very different. Want to go for a spin? Um... I mean, it's okay. You don't have to. We can just... Another time. No, no, I want to. Thank you. JUDD: Just needs a few minutes to warm up. (ENGINE FALTERING) Come on! Told you! (COURTNEY LAUGHING) Guys, wait up! (ENGINE SPUTTERING) (COURTNEY GIGGLING) I'm sorry! It's just... I told you she needed some work. Maybe I should get out of here before she blows up. Maybe. It's not that far. We can walk. It's probably safer. (INDISTINCT) (MIMICS EXPLOSION) Oh, man! JOEL: Forest fire! Put it out! Put it out! Look! Spy! GILL: Get him! Grab the dog! He whacked him! Give me my dog! Yo, man! What did you do that for? Did you see what happened to Joel? You going to rat on us, fink? I'm not going to tell anyone. I just wanted to be friends. Guys, I tripped. (SCOFFS) I got my own friends and I'm sticking with them. SLIM: Let's go! Hey! I tripped, man! JOEL: Now he knows who's boss, right, Gill? Yeah. I know! I mean, that was so cool, guys! Commander one, this is Eagle 15, ready for detonation. Stand by! And... Ka-Boom! Yeah! That was so cool, man! You stick one of those in a can, you can blow a whole house! Yeah, right, bozo! Once my cousin gave me one of those, and on a dare, I had to throw it into this old hag's window, that lived next to my bonehead cousin. It blew out all her windows! And she was never heard from again. SLIM: I hate this bridge, man. JOEL: It's faster. GILL: Chicken. SLIM: Am not! GILL: If you could swim. SLIM: Man, you can't swim either! GILL: Yes, I can. SLIM: You're such a liar. Man, slow down! Hurry up! You know, I can too swim. The closest I've ever seen you to water, is dirty bath water. Shut up, fatso! You shut up! Ahhh! (SLIM SCREAMING) Do something! Help me! Help! I'll go get help! (SHRIEKING) Help! Sam! Get him! You got him, man! You're gonna be all right! Come here! You got him! You got him! Sam! Come on. Come on, Sam! Come on! Let him go! Hey, Gill! Gill! Are you all right? Gill! (CHOKING) Hey! Get away from him! What are you doing? Gill! He saved his life! Chaser! Chaser! SLIM: Chaser! JOEL: Chaser! I think he's gone, Sam. GARY: Chaser! SAM: Chaser! Chaser! Chaser! Buddy, we've been looking a long time. I hate to say it, he may be gone. Dad, can't we look just a little longer? Yeah, I guess we can. Hey, I tell you what though, if we don't find him, we'll get another great dog. I don't want another dog. I want Chaser. Come on. Chaser! For the window I broke. I'm paying you back. You don't have to. Please, just take it. Sorry about the haunted house. And I'm sorry about the poison ivy. That was you? Hey, I'm really sorry about your dog. So, you want to play catch? Okay, let's simmer down. Sam Docherty, would you stand up, please? Now for those of you who don't know already, Sam Docherty is not only our newest student, but, he is Woodfield's newest hero as well. (CHEERING) Okay, I'd recommend that you go out for the swim team, if we only had one. Okay, let's get to work. Turn to page 84, please. I want you to answer questions one through six. Hi, Mrs. Docherty. Oh! Oh, you are such a gentleman. Thank you. My pleasure. Uh, let me get these on the grill, Courtney's inside. Thanks. Hi. Hi. I, uh, got you something. Wow, they have tattoos! I dig 'em. Yeah, they're my favorite. Thank you. No, Gill, you can't do that. The knight can only move two up and one to the side. This makes no sense. It's easy. Why can't we just move them all the same way? Because, this is chess. (SCOFFING) Can I help you? I brought a little peace offering. Thank you. Guess I never really introduced myself proper. My name's Mack Weatherton. Gary Docherty. Welcome to Woodfield, Gary. Thank you. And I got you some fish. Yes, you did! Thank you. Sam. Sam, I, uh... Thank you. Thank you very much. Sure. (CHASER BARKS) Chaser! Found him down river, all the way in Smithfield. Come on. There you go. Oh, gee! Thank you, Dennis! Hey, no problem! Welcome home, boy! GARY: Let's do it. Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere where, you know, somewhere we can really live. MARILYN: Where, Gary? I don't know, anywhere. Somewhere. (MARILYN SNICKERS) Maybe we can go somewhere where kids are kind to each other. You know, where kids can be kids. SLIM: Guys, you want to hear a joke? ALL: No. All right, well, I'm going to tell you anyway! (ALL LAUGH) All right, how can you tell Ronald McDonald on the beach? JOEL: I don't know. GILL: Oh! SAM: How? GILL: How? SLIM: He's the only one with sesame seed buns.
