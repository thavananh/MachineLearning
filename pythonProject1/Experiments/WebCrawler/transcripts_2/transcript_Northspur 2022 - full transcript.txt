foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- It's okay. It's Kellan, he lives up here too. You're defending the valley? It's not safe. It's a lot of bad people about. Haven't reached here yet? Starting to. Ugly world's finding us. The valley's not hidden anymore. Safe. Protector from above. - You are. - Yeah? Had a good haul. Yeah? Mm. Without hurting anyone? Or I wouldn't have. How close? Very. Oh, come on. I think you can help me with this. Are warning shots gonna keep them away? No. Not killing anyone. We have to make a statement. Come on. Danger time. Hey Melinda. Cleaned up that bit of rusty iron you been having me on about. Yeah. I didn't started on the fences yet though. Kellan. Well, I mean, it just seems a bit excessive. It's life or death, Kellan. It'll be all right. No, it won't be all right! Nothing will be all right unless we sort it. Okay, okay, okay. I'll sort it. I will. What's wrong? I dunno, I dunno. Something's not right. Holy shit, Melinda. Oh, you don't swear. I know, but what... How did you... I cut it. Where? Shit, the car. Oh shit. I think it might be reacting. I'll get first aid, just stay there. I'm coming, Lin, hey! Anaphylactic shock. Melinda. Ah, shit! Okay, okay, adrenaline. Okay, getting it, okay, baby, stay with me. I'm sorry. Baby, okay, stay with me. Melinda, Melinda. Hey baby. Wake up. Come on. Come on, Melinda. Come on. Oh God, come on, please God. That's the one? Yeah. Hey, come here. I'm here, baby, I'm here. Okay, okay, you're okay. Just breathe. Breathe. Okay. I think I'm okay. Oh, baby... Be honest. This, this bacteria, they release TK549. It affects some more than others. We've been washing our food, but with an open wound it's... Can I have it sort of just... Our antibiotics'll keep it at bay for now. We have a six day supply. And for us to have any real chance at it going on, we need injectable trimoxazole shots. Hey, hey, we'll find 'em, we'll find 'em. Wait, wait, wait, wait, don't, no please, no! I have to go out there and find those shots. I'm protected, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Five rounds. No warning shots. What happened to Kenny? Needed his mum. This is your cabin? Who are you? Hey, please. I'm unarmed, I'm not here to take anything. I just, I came looking for medicine. Okay, my wife is dying and I, please, I'll... I'll go. Okay, I'm, please... I've been tracking you for an hour. The path you walked to this cabin is exactly right or you would've lost your legs. I used to come here as a kid. Why would you have done that? Holidays. Camp Northspur. Well, it's no holiday now. My wife says I'm protected. Who by? Man upstairs. You don't believe that. God, yeah. Protection, I'm not sure yet. Sit. Your wife. Cut herself on a piece of rusty iron a couple of days ago, Southbury Valley. My fault. Had a bad reaction and been going to hell ever since. I'm gonna find her some of those trimoxazole shots. Or else she... So you killed her. I'm gonna save her. Bacteria, anyone with an open wound's as good as dead. I'm aware of that. So you'd know those drugs are oxygen to a lot of people. Even if you could find them, some would kill you within days to get them. I'm gonna try. I have to. You're alive. You won't make it out there. That's up to why I'm telling you. I survived by being practical, trusting no one. You, you're naive. You're a corpse in waiting. No. Lord's protecting me. Lord? Bullshit, look around you. This is post-God, post-love. Best thing you can do is forget your wife. She's gone. Sentiment'll put you in the ground quicker in a bullet. No, we're without love, I mean, what's the point in that? Shit! Bastards are trying to burn me out. Who? Randoms. Make yourself useful, snowflake. Thought you didn't trust anyone. Use it on them. Not me. Get the pump! What pump? Go now! Quick, before it catches! Come on, go, move it! What the hell was that? Just a sprinkler system, tried to burn me up before. I just can't figure out how to automate it. No, I mean using me as a fireman in a moving target. If it took we both would've burned. I have to find drugs for my wife. Okay, not risk my life 'cause of some crazy stranger. You can shoot me if you want. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I said, wait. I got the drugs in there. They're in that safe in my gun cabinet. I could do with your help for the next week. I'll give you the drugs in there too. Help doing what? Failing the cabin. This cabin, from who? Oh, I annoyed some people from Blackton. Coming next week there's gonna be a tangle. What if I just kill you in the night? Take the drugs. A, you're not the killing type, yet anyway. B, only I have the combination. And C, you try to remove that safe, it's rigged to blow. Why do you have them anyway? I got 'em for her. My wife. Grazed her arm on a rusty nail. I should have hammered her arm. Okay. I'll help, 'cause I need the drugs. It's just for a week. I'll have to get back to my life. Still think you'd be better off forgetting her. Make your own way. That what you did? A week. There's a pit there, a mine over there, and a trap just there. Come a long way since my day. Cabin's all rigged too. Mechanical is solar. Without power, there's only so much you can do. You got dynamite. Faith and expectation. Fuck, stupid! Bloody stupid. You sleep here. You got a blanket? It's not Airbnb. Surprised you know what that is. Wanna mint on your pillow too? There's water on the fire. Well, that'd be bad for it. Mine's black, no sugar. Going somewhere? Stocking my fallback shelter. These bottles? Just to remind me never go back. There's a poem on the back of that painting. Yeah, I'm not really a poetry guy. So this week are we expecting anyone in particular? Shell Mightley. How's the town? Quiet. It doesn't sound like my town. We've beaten them down pretty good. So why don't I hear anguished cries from the street? They have strong spirits. Shit! Those get broken all the time. Mine did, now it's unbreakable. Do them a favor! You okay? Are you? Why do we need mortars? We're going after Summer's cabin. He's a one man arsenal. Two men now apparently. Two men against one woman. I pity him. He won't have half the brain power he needs. More stew tonight. This is variation. No, no, no, no, no! Don't shoot! Okay. You homicidal maniac! Why? Gotta come back. Got bolder. You asshole. You gotta be to survive. People can change, they can turn. If you just keep killing everybody who turns up... People don't turn ever, they get harder and harder. Once compassion's left the building, believe me, it ain't coming back. The hell is that, is that bush wisdom? It's all bullshit. You need to a harden up, son. Get practical real quick. Practical? That what this is? Those men you killed. Would've done the same to us, change the subject. Okay? Sure. Let's let's have a conversation, yeah. Some stuff you need to know. Shell Mightley's sick, she needs the drugs too. That's why she's coming. Well, that's that's great. Plus, I might have annoyed one or two poachers down Quiltern Lakes by taking their game. You're a real peach. And there's a Locton gang from Halcrow. They want something back from me. In fact, this cabin, Northspur Crossroads, about the deadliest spot around. Even if we survived this week, I'll be lucky to live another month, but I'm sure as shit not going down without a fight. You're just telling me this now. Well, I couldn't tell you before. You might not have helped me. Okay, alright, so change your plan. You can either go to that safe so I can get back to my wife or I get busy on your eyes. You can't torture me for that code. Why not? A, you're not the type, B, I wouldn't give up that code even under the threat of death. And C... You try that again, you won't wake up. I'm worried about my wife. Four days, get used to it. What happened? You got both my tasers, got 'em on a rig. I never saw a rig. Doesn't matter what you saw. What you were saying last night about all these people trying to get a piece of you. You're not exactly popular, are you? I aim to be alive. Not be popular. Need to get busy then. Come out now! Who is it? What do you want? I'll give you some food if you go! I'm sorry. I'm hungry. Is it just you? Come here. It's okay. No. It's okay, I'm safe. I need to find Melinda. I'm Melinda. Where did you come from? My house, nearby. What happened? My mom and dad got killed. Honey, I'm sorry, come here, come on. Mommy told me to find you. Are you Jessica's girl? She was my friend, but I haven't seen her for ages. Oh, baby. Bastards have got drones. Who? Quiltern Lake poachers. Must have fixed the circuit boards, used solar panels to charge 'em. Why would they need drones? Dropping grenades, gets 'em over the booby traps. Shotgun. They're too fast for that. Want my target shooter. Another one. Yeah, hell yeah! Still got some skills, I guess. Now take the poachers out. No. There's still lurking at there. Yeah, but they're not attacking. Well, hold on, what are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? Hey! Hey, hey, they're going, stop! Hey, they're going! Just leave it. Yeah, okay. Don't ever make me risk my life outta here again. Crazy old man. Thought you were protected. Thanks for the drones. Should have finished off the guys. Mercy's better than vengeance. Get that from your book? Something like that. People don't turn. Honey, come back here, quick. Honey, put that down, be careful! Dear, how fast can you run? Fast. Okay. Now go! Don't look back! Question is how many rounds do you have? The one that goes through your forehead's the only one you're gonna know about. You all right? Yeah, yes, honey, yes. Why don't you tell me what happened? Your mom was my friend, but I lost contact. She took a picture, showed me how to find your house. She said to run here if anything happened, My dad tried to fight them. I hid in the cupboard. I heard my mom screaming. At night, I came out and ran here. Come here, baby, come on. You did good. You did real good. Your mom would be proud. I'm proud. And if you'd like, I can look after you. I can look after you too. You and your wife have kids? Not yet. Wise move in this world. And do we want kids? In this world. Has to be some point to it. We're waiting for a miracle. You got a mother? Father? I haven't seen my father in a long time. Blames me for my mother dying, sees me as weak, useless. Well, you're not entirely useless. Why you still have those drugs and stuff for your wife? What was that? Just rats. Are you sure? No one'll make it across that ground. Is that rabbit or possum? Very hard to find caviar. Your wife. Is gone. So we're done. You loved once, still do? Sucker's game. EMP attack, pathogen follower. Quartered the population, wiped. No weakness, no love. I'm okay with that. I don't think you are. Had a son, George, full of life, larger than life. He was a top dressing pilot. Hit some power lines one day. He's gone, I'm still here. I've got a daughter too. Tried to reconcile with her a while ago. But anyway, nevermind. "After the cutting and parry, a storming shot. Scream of horses rearing. Shouts of war are lost in quiet pines. And we live calm among the glades once more. The metal clearing. Always loved that poem. Calm after the storm. Gotta have the storm to get to the calm. Those poachers were just a warm-up. To what? Come. This one has got a big mouth. He's shooting it off against you. Well, we can't have that. You want us to beat him, boss? No, this was the Deputy Mayor. - Oh. - Oh! How's it going, Harry? Bit rough. You used to babysit me. I liked you. You were kind. You were a good kid. What happened to me? Your father, I guess. I guess. Oh, you knew. Knew, but I didn't like it. You had me at knew. You were a cricket fan, right? Yeah. Mm. Ah! Hey! Come out, out! Bloody hell, what are you doing? Out! You stupid fucker, you could have killed him. Who? Robbie? Robbie. It's alright. This is Kellan. I rescued him a year back from the Locton gang. They were keeping him as a slave. When you arrived, he hid the fallback cabinet, Take him food every night. He's the one who tasered you, aren't you, sir? He's a bit scared of people, been beaten. Sorry I called you a stupid fucker. Sorry I shot at you. Robbie, you take my blanket, mate. Hey, it's alright. It's alright. It won't hurt you. He'll come around. Okay? You all right? Okay. No! What? They're taking our food. Have any other food? Yeah, but I need my greens. Let me get 'em. Here. No, no. The agreement was to defend the cabin, not risk my life for some veggies. Good, toughening up. Robbie, you stay here. If you die, Robbie's gonna be here alone, I'm not gonna get my drugs. Is that compassion or practicality? Bit of both. Oi! Hey! I wouldn't. Wait, no, no, wait! Next time you say I wouldn't, make sure they know you mean it. Hey, Robbie, Robbie, wait, wait! Okay, you all right, yeah? What happened to your parents? They drank some bad water, died. I was hiding. Looking for food. Then found shelter with some men. The Locton gang. The leader. He beat me. I get that, sucks eh? Hey, we're gonna protect you, I promise. I'll show you. Here, give me your hand. Slap, pound, that's a promise. Good boy. Summers thinks that cabin of his is impregnable, but I've already unlocked it with my mind. Why do you want him so bad, boss? He's got something I need. There's more to it than that. Not if I don't say so. He's just an ornery old man. He's anything but! - What's wrong? - No, damn it! Get off me, it's Kellan, get off! No! If you kill each other, I don't want to live either! Look here Robbie, put the gun down, mate. Put the gun down. Please. Give me the gun. Good boy. And we, we need to stick together and we'll make it, yeah? Back to bed, honey. I'm just getting a drink. There's noises outside. Okay. Melinda, Melinda, Melinda, Melinda! Please Melinda, please wake up. Come here! No! No, Melinda, help! Okay, okay, you're okay. Do it. Don't come back. Weak, so I will! One last day. That was the deal. Sorry. For what? I can't help with Shell Mightley. She comes after I go. No, it's my fight. You know her. Could say that. Righto. We want the boy back. Just send him out. We'll leave you alone. Locton gang. Not happening, Green. He's ours, you know that. He's his now. He's my boy. I fostered him when he had no one else. Gave him a good life, roof over his head. Three meals a day. How many beatings? Discipline, what he needs. He doesn't need it now. Go on. Where are they going? They won't reach us. Well, he's getting closer. Watch. Using ladders to get over the track. Think they're gonna use that thing for cover? Yeah. Come on! Double back. You reckon they're gonna rush us. No, we pick 'em off. I reckon they'll leave it until tonight and have a shot. You have anymore? No. Do you know how to pray? Quick, quick, quick. Be very quiet. Not weak! What are you waiting for? You two line up! Not wasting a bullet. Robbie, go down the fallback shelter. You hear them come in the cabin, take the tunnel and run. Go! - What now? - Need to know basis. I think they're about to storm. How's the pacifism? Receding, like your hairline. Or fading, like your humor. Shut us up. Oh, shit! You all right? Keep firing. Be quiet, boy. All right. Shut us down. Drop it. Put it down. Slowly. Good lad. Gone quiet, he must be inside. I've got the boy down below. Safe and sound. Okay, so why don't you go then? Gotta see the old fella off first. Why? Trouble he's caused me. I had high hopes for you, son. I thought you'd harden up. Become a man. But nah, you couldn't take it, could you? Could never understand I was doing it for you. Not to you, like my dad did for me. Well, it's a shitty world out there, boy. Even more so now. And you, people like you, you're gonna be eaten alive. You're better off out of it. You're with him now, right? Yeah. Well then. You beat Robbie too? Oh, don't worry. He's a good boy, he'll learn. But you? Nah, it's too late for you. What if I stopped you? Well, I doubt that's gonna happen. Don't doubt. Have faith. Let's go again. Won't be coming back. You stay with it. That should hold 'em. Why are they screaming? I installed acid, not water. What? Keep me covered, I'll go and get Robbie. Hey, hey, come on. It's me. You're all right, you're safe now. What are you gonna do? I don't know, I'm thinking. Not your strong point, is it, son? Like the time you tried to give your mother her medication. She had cancer. She said you... She asked me to, what was I supposed to do? Where were you? Our happy holidays. I despised that life. I hated it. And your mum, she loved me and I resented her for it. I resented the hold she had over me, that life. Soft, pointless. No, this is me strong, surrounded by the strong. You're not strong. You boys aren't so strong now. Yeah, the Battle and the Fray. They'll get over it. Mom loved that poem. Yeah, looks like you did us both a favor. Eh? Slimy little shit. I think he got away, come on. - No, no, no! - Hey! What do you think you're doing? This only ends when he does. Just leave it. Just leave it. Wait, what are you doing? It's a mercy killing. Besides, if we let 'em go, they'll be back for revenge. Is that compassion or practicality? Bit of both. Melinda, Melinda, wake up! Well, week's out. You're free to go. I'll get the drugs. Shell Mightley? Not your problem. I just leave you and Robbie here? You will leave me. Not Robbie, he's got a future. Here, you take it. Drugs all for me. Thought they were for your wife. Yeah, but I was too late. What happened to you? Forgot to wash my food. Just once, that's all it took. So now it's your wife or me. She gets 'em. We'll split 'em. No, there's not enough. I'll stay and fight. You give Robbie a future. Robbie, you go with Kellan now, okay? Don't want to, please, I don't wanna go. He's got an important mission. He needs your help. Please, I wanna stay with you. I won't leave. Come on, come on. - No, please. - Come on, come on. Come on, here we go, come on. No, please. Hey, I'll look after you, okay? So take those ladders. They'll get you out safely, then run. What are you waiting for, an Uber? Yeah, I know what they are. Get outta here. Feel like I'm running from a fight. You'll have plenty. This one's mine. Come on, mate. Come on. Let's go. No prisoners. Summers dies along with whoever he's got with him. Come on, let's go. Hey, hey, wait, don't shoot, don't shoot. Put the gun down. I'm Kellan. Do you know Melinda? Yeah, she's told you about me, yeah? Do you know where she is, honey? Yeah, down there? Yeah, give me the gun, honey. Yeah, good girl, you stay there. Robbie, you stay here with her. Melinda. Melinda, Melinda, honey! Melinda. Melinda? Hey, baby. Oh come on, oh come on. Okay, come on. Okay. Come wake up, baby. Come on. Come on, wake up baby, wake up. Baby, come on! Come on, Melinda! Come on! Wake up. Oh baby, baby! Hey, I'm here, I'm here. I'm here, I'm here, it's okay. How you feeling? Much better. Swelling's gone down too. Good. That was very good. Who's this? That's Robbie. He needs a home. This? Tia. Hello, Tia. Those drugs, did you have to... And old man gave them to me. You wanna stay with us? I'm gonna have to go back. Now, why? I have to help the man who gave me those drugs. Then I'm seeing my dad. Just one day. I'll be back. I'll be back. Hey, hey, hey, take it easy, easy old man. Least you didn't say crazy. Those are for your wife. She can spare one. Shell Mightley's coming. I'd been dying to meet her. You should go home to your wife and kid. You could get killed here. Lord's watching over me. My faith's still in the barrel. How you feeling? Fighting fit. Good. You okay Robbie, ? Yeah. We just have to stick together. Then we'll be okay. I need you to be strong soon. I need to go help Kellan. It's okay. She's nice. Come on, you're okay. Jimmy! Summers! We can shatter your cabin to bits if we want. That's how I got my nickname. What about your other name? Didn't like my real name. Go ahead then. Might lose the drugs. Why even bring it up? Lord, I'm sorry for that I have to do this. Just please keep them safe while I'm away. Nothing we can do about those. She won't do it. I know her well. How well? Her real name's Michelle Summers. She's your daughter. I drank a lot in those days. Used to knock my wife and her around. My wife forgave me, but she never could Tried to reconcile with her in Blackton a while ago. Didn't work out. She took my office in more ways than one. I snatched some more drugs there, but the way she treats the town, I'd rather she didn't get 'em. So you beat your wife and kid. Yeah, and I'm ashamed of it. I've changed. That's what I wanted to tell her, but she wouldn't believe me. Well, I do. I've seen the way you are with Robbie. Those rollies were just distractions. This is the real attack. My gun is jammed! You okay with that? It's them or us, right? All right, I assume you're still alive. I'd be disappointed if you weren't. Those were just the opening salvos. Come on out! I'm right here! My spies told me you'd made a friend. Been looking after a boy. Caring. That'll get you killed, daddy-o. Yeah, well, better love and a bullet than just a bullet. Love. You wouldn't recognize it. You never accepted mom's culture, her language. So I decided you didn't accept me either. And oh, oh. The beatings! Love for me was the back of your hand. Yeah, I was stupid, pathetic, wrong, but I did love her and I love you. He came to see me last night. We bonded over a drink or three, our mutual hatred for family life. The ones on the roof, rubber boots. Made for big drops. All right, it's done now. Accept. It. What's the matter, old man? Can give a beating, but you can't take one. I'm sick. Yeah. Well, join the club. I need those drugs. I gave them away. Don't believe you. Open it! Hey, he's telling the truth. Just keep it out of it, son. Leave it for the grown ups. You always were a pipsqueak. I'm a lot stronger than you. How do you figure that? 'Cause I can forgive you. Open that safe. If there's nothing there, it's your last act. I gave 'em to someone worthy. Then you have no further use. Don't worry. I'll do it for you. After the cut and parry storming the shot. The screams of horses rearing, shouts of war are lost in quiet pines, and we live calm among the glades once more. The battle clearing. I'll take the cut and parry. No pines or glades here. This only ends when. They won't be able to. Ah, we will. I will. Ah. I doubt that very much. Don't doubt, have faith, dad. He wasn't gonna change. Couldn't. I swapped the taser parts into the pistol housing. Don't know why. Love. Come with us. We've got a nice house and yours is kind of... Think Blackton needs a new mayor. What are you gonna do with her? Keep her locked up, for now. Maybe she'll turn. I've heard it's possible. I wouldn't. This is impressive. God helps those. Amen to that.
