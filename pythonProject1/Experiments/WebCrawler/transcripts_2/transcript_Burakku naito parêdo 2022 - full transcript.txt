foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Toho Co., Ltd. Let's talk about the real Christmas. During Christmas, Santa Claus, wearing a red suit, visits only good children and gives them presents. But that's not true. The real Christmas... is actually more impartial. Of course, Santa Claus comes to the good children, but also to the bad children. That's right... The Santa Claus wearing a black suit comes to them. Black Night Parade 50% Off From the Listed Price I'm now going to eat! Kaiza! I told you, you shouldn't eat the meal boxes that are scrapped! What? But if we throw them away, it's like it would feel like the world would go "beam~!" I'm sorry, what are you trying to say? If the manager finds out, you'll get fired, you know. No, even the manager is like, you know, a really pretentious guy! Kaiza, listen... It's like flexibility sure is asked even in job hunting. That's because being obedient are only praised until elementary school! That's why you can't get a job no matter how long you wait! The shrimp tail is so good! It bites! I wonder... I'm Hino Miharu. 22 years old. 19 years ago, my father, who was a delivery driver, passed away in an accident. I was raised by my mother on her own. I think I was one of those people who lived a relatively serious life and didn't grow up. Then... I failed the university entrance exam. Then I thought I'd get a job, so I started job hunting, but... My name is Hino Miharu, nice to meet you. Let's see. I am very impressed by your company's corporate philosophy of being "the most customer-oriented company in Japan," I would like to work for your company and take good care of your customers. We can't hire him. He just stopped. We can't hire him. He's the only one that doesn't move at all. Shall we move on to the next applicant? Yeah, let's proceed to the next candidate. Dear Hino Miharu, Rejected Rejected Before I knew it, three years had passed since I had been working on meager jobs. Powson Nerima Kitaguchi Branch Christmas Cake Delivery Day By the way, Sir, I got an unofficial job offer! What? I got an unofficial job offer! I'm going to get a job! I can quit part-time jobs this year. Sir? Wait... Th-That's great! Cake! Here's some cake! No, thanks. By the way, can I leave? Huh? No, it's still half an hour early, and I have to take a break from eating... Are you listening? Kaiza. Done with your part-time job? Hey, I told you to wait outside~ I'm sorry~ Relax. I'll give you the best night of your life as a present as promised. Okay? That's why I'll be on my way, Sir! What? Oh, okay! I'll take care of the rest so have fun! But is it really okay that he's not leaving yet? Idiot! Convenience stores are open 24 hours a day! Sorry, Sir! She really doesn't know anything how the world works. But it's Christmas after all and everything. You know, if you become someone as kind as him, you'll work for the sake of everyone! Yes! The point it, he's a night view! He will play the role of a night view! Thank you! Eve To think his girlfriend is so cute! That surprised me. Manager, I'm sorry. If I were a customer... What are you going to do? I'm sorry, but... I'll be leaving after I take out the trash. By the way... At the top of your bag... ...there was this. Um... I was about to punch that at the cash register later... K-Kaiza was... What did you say? Um... Kaiza... Hey! Don't blame Kaiza. If you eat scrapped products... ...it's crime. He's blaming me? Why? Seriously, why? I've never been late, I've never left early, and I've had a good work ethic. Why... why am I the only one? That's because being obedient are only praised until elementary school! Found a bad boy! Rejection Letter It's like the whole world is... ...throwing out notices of rejection to me. Excuse me. Good evening! Have a seat. One beer for now, please. Got it. Oh, Mister. Are you a Santa? No, it's from my part-time job. Well, you look like you're working hard with what you're wearing too. No, this is nothing. Santa Clauses in red are probably the ones working hardest tonight. True. Here. One more please. You're a good drinker. Something bad happened? No, nothing like that... - Thanks. - Sure. Speaking of which, why are you wearing a black Santa suit? Hm? You don't you know about this one, Sir? Originally, two Santas always come at Christmas. Red Santa Claus comes at good kids. And a Black Santa comes at bad kids. What does a black Santa do? They give bad kids coals... ...or internal organs as presents. Internal organs? For the kids that are worse... A whipping. No, that's abuse! And for the far more... Far more worse kids... What?! Huh?! Hey, sack! I'm still explaining! Where am I? What? Are you awake? You're the black one... It wasn't a dream... Let's start in the middle of what I said before. For the far worse kids... ...they'll be put in a sack and abducted. And they'll work as a Black Santa for Christmas. Congratulations, Miharu. What? Here's an unofficial job offer. Huh? Job offer? Huh? Your monthly salary is 300 thousand yen. There's a bonus pay raise for overtime. Huh? That's a good term. Huh? Well, for now, sign the contract. No, wait, um... Well, well, for now, sign the contract... I was just eaten, didn't I?! No. Liar! I can still feel the teeth and the tongue! J-Just what are you anyway?! Okay, okay, I'll check. What? Did you eat Miharu? No, Knecht. You were watching, right? I spat him out properly! I didn't digest him! So he says. What do you think, Miharu... I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Ah. You're Miharu, right? I'm Shino. Knecht asked us to show you around. I'm Teppei. Nice to meet you. A-Are you human beings? Here you go. Those are pork miso soup and rice balls. I think you should eat something warm if you can. Teppei is the head chef here! You might not be able to eat something you're not used to. What's with him? He can be a wife. Thank you. It's delicious. That's good to hear. Eating something warm makes you feel better, huh? What a nice girl. If a girl like her were a coworker, work would be fun too. We'll show you around when you're done eating. Do you have any questions? Ah, I have... What is it? Who's that man in the Black Santa suit and scarf? He is Knecht, president of this Santa Claus House. President?! That's too suspicious! And what is that sack with a mouth? It was talking too! That's our company mascot! Huh? It was drooling all over the place. I think it's called Kimokawa? It's cute once you get used to it. Used to it...? And I was abducted! Could it be that you guys are forced to work too? Oh no! We just got hired to regular jobs! Because isn't it wonderful to be able to help Santa Claus? What? It's a rewarding work. It's pretty hard work before Christmas, though. This is a totally bad facility... You see, I'd like to go outside and cool my head... Outside? But it's very cold... You go out there and turn left. Go out and to the left... I'm sorry! Goodbye! As long as I can get out here, I can make it! What? Cold... Have you cool your head? Where is this? This is the North Pole. I told you, this is the Santa Claus House. This place makes and delivers presents to children around the world. This is the base of Santa Claus. No way! No! You sure are a skeptic. Here you go. I charged it for you. Why don't you look at the map? Missed Calls and Voice Messages from the Manager Miharu, even if you're on leave, contact me. You're a working adult, right? Do you know how much trouble you'll cause at work? I'll report you to the higher-ups along with shoplifting of scrapped products. Kaiza 2 New Messages Thanks for letting me leave early!! I had the best night LOL What will you do? Do you want to go back working... ...as a night view on Christmas? Or do you want to... Become the real star of Christmas? From a sled's point of view, these guys are the night view. Well, let's go back inside. We'll freeze to death... I never thought I would be working overseas now! LOL I am anxious, but I have to do my best! With my new friends, I wish you all Merry Christmas! As if. I never... ...turned into just a night view! This is where my forced labor began. Tell me, Mr. Hat! What is the Black Santa Claus? Hello~! New employees! Today I'm going to let you all know about the Black Santa! Something just came out. Santa's job is to give presents to children all over the world. Good children will be given good presents they want! As for bad children... That's right! Innards! Innards? ...or was apparently given to them. But now we give bad kids bad presents that suit them! How's that? Did you guys get it? This is our job as Black Santa! Everyone! Let's do our best for Christmas! Bad presents? Oh, come on. You know this already. What's this mysterious quality and funding to transplant my room into the North Pole? This company is too sketchy! The Santa Claus House is divided into numerous departments. First, you need to decide which department you will be in. This is the department called the Sock Post. Here, we collect and analyze letters sent by good kids all over the world and letters placed by their pillows. Don't sleep! Work, work, work! Wow, this is a picture-perfect black company! We have no choice, it's for the children. Are you saying you can get away with anything if it's for the children? It's an important job. We're going to choose what to give based on the wishes of the children we read. Well, that's true, but... They are all wearing Black Santa suits. Probably because it's a black company! Yes. All of the best employees are Black Santa. Then where are the Red Santa? That was a long time ago. There's nothing like that now. None? That's right. We, the Black Santa, are handing out presents to both good and bad kids. Tokyo... Paris... Buenos Aires. They really do come from all over the world. In order to be assigned to this department, you need to be able to read at least five languages or more. How many can you read? You're going to ask that to someone jobless? Ah... Don't give me that reaction. What's the next department? The eye of the chimney, simply called Chimney. Shino is the ace in this department. Ah! Miharu, welcome to Chimney! What is this place? Shino, if you please. Okay then, I'll choose from Japanese children so that it's easy for you to understand. The first bad kid is...? Huh? Shino? This boy! Dear Santa, It's cold, but since you're doing your best, I kept my promise. If I get a 90 or higher score on the English test, I can ask you for it! That's why I study hard every day. I would like to have a Ninnin Sketch and a Monkari4 for my presents! He's a very nice boy! I wonder about that... What? From the postmark, here's the list of elementary schools in the area. There are five candidates. English classes must start with third graders. When searching for 3rd graders and up...! There he is! Bingo! Futoyama Takashi, 3-1 at Iruka Elementary School! Wait a minute. They are completely personal information. 3-1 are just having a short quiz, huh? Now, aiming through the window on the left. I'm switching to thermal imaging. What? What? That's strange. Only one student has a higher body temperature. He's not nervous about the quiz! Picking up the heat of the brush's friction, comparing it to the handwriting on the letter... Found you~! Now, zooming in... How is he? Yeah. No doubt about it. He's a bad boy. What? He's cheating from his notes in the back of his eraser case. He's pretty good at it, so he must be a habitual offender. Isn't it amazing? This is the magic of Black Santa that lets you tell whether a child is good or bad. That's a satellite, right?! It's very scary you know! What about the children's privacy? Privacy? Santa trespasses from the chimney at night and goes near the bed. Don't you think it's too late for privacy at this point? It's certainly a crime, but still! Next is the present factory called Coal. So big... If we're going to distribute presents all over the world, it needs to be this big. What exactly are they building here? They can make anything. And of course, Ninnin Sketches and Monkari for the good kids. Even smart phones. But I feel it's illegal to make that. It's simple to make. But it's the hardest thing to choose what to give. We can give out what the child wants for the good ones, but that's not the case for the bad ones. So there's a whole department dedicated to picking out gifts for the bad kids. It's Mr. Hat from earlier! Wait a minute, he is really cute... Are you the new guy? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Can this guy be useful around here?! You are totally an old man inside! Hey! Hey! Hey! Can this guy be useful around here?! You are totally an old man inside! Hey! Hey! Where are your manners?! Good morning. W-W-What the hell are these guys?! Fairies. No! It's beyond my fantasy capacity! Hey! Yes, Sir. - Hey. - Yes, Sir. - Hey. - Yes, Sir. - Hey. - Yes, Sir. - Hey, hey. - Yes, Sir. Hey. - Hey. - Yes, Sir. Hey, follow me. Yes, Sir. I can't see. Ah, it's okay, it's okay. - I can't see. - There are equipments... Sit down. What is this place...? Sit down! Here, put this on. Without the children's role, we can't get started. No way! Aren't they needles?! Just put it on! - They are safe needles. - Huh? Wait! Wait! - Just put this on! - Wait, wait, wait... - These needles are safe. - Ah! Aah! Here, here. Let's see, I have to pierce this. - Aah! Ow! - Ah, sorry, sorry. - Ah! Ow! - Good! They are good needles! It's acupuncture so it should feel good. Now, here, here. - Ah! Ow! Ah! Ah! - Oh, shut up. Alright, alright! Ah, right here, right here. There, it's pierced! Takashi~ Taka~ Taka, Merry Christmas! Ah, did Santa come? Yay! A Ninin Sketch! And there's also Monkari... ...3! It's the one before the latest... Mommy! Mommy! Give this back, Mommy! I don't want it if it's not 4! - Calm down! - Mommy! You're Hino Miharu, a 22-year-old good for nothing. His disappointment index is 25! 25?! Hey! This little rascal should have 45 disappointment rate! Are you okay? Child roles are as tough as ever, huh? What kind of torture is this? It made me feel so tired... Based on bad kids' investigation, we calculate the disappointment index. We run a simulation and find a present that matches the disappointment index. Ah, I see... I mean, I don't know what that means! We're going to go on forever until we hit it right. Is this hell?! Hey, is the next one ready? Yes, Sir. We were thinking of turning the game into a Yokai Switch next... Huh?! You can't do that! What? You're dealing with a bad kid, right?! If you want to disappoint a bad kid that that much... You should use this! But he would wished for... Just get on with it! Takashi. Taka~ Taka, Merry Christmas! What's my present? Alright! Ninnin Sketch and Monkari 4! Golden brown...? Not this one! I wanted a sky blue one! Takashi! Did you get the Ninnin Sketch? Let's play Monkari! You must have the latest model, right?! Let me see! Hey! Stay away! S-Stop. Stop~ That's golden brown! Golden brown is like poop! Wow! The poop is shining! Ah! Let's give Takashi a nickname. Let's call him poop gold! Mommy! Wow! A perfect 45! Zero margin of error?! To think we've always had +-3 effectivity! Ah, I'm exhausted... I would never join this department... Miharu! Welcome to our department! NOOO! I've been assigned to the Coal Department. Business cards? Who am I going to give these to? Miharu, are you done? Can I come in? I'm not done yet! Not yet! Wow! It looks good on you! Thanks... - Oh~! - Thank you for waiting. - Oh! Thank you. - Alright~ Oh, thanks. Okay, let's eat. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yay! - Yay! Yay~! Yay~! How many few more? Teppei, I want you to smile! We can't see Teppei's smile for now... Aaahhh! Mayu, a 4-years-old has exactly a disappointment index of 12! Kenji, 8 years old, has a exactly a disappointment index of 26! Yumi, 6 years old, has a exactly a disappointment index of 51! Alright! Today's work is clear! He's really amazing. Anyway, since he is too fast, go get some more child data. Yes, Sir. A test? And what's with the reindeer? The delivery person who delivers presents is in the Flourish Department of the Santa Claus House. It is the test to become that reindeer. Oh, I see. It sounds kind of difficult. A lot of people take it, but they won't even announce who was chosen. We don't know what the passing rate is. But there is a special compensation for the selected reindeer. Compensation? Well, that's a little tempting... Reindeer Special Compensation: 10 Million Yen 10 million?! By the way, the leader will be paid another 10 million. - Interested? - I am! I am! I am! Wow! Look, look! What's going on? It's the reindeers. Only nine reindeer are chosen. They carry on the name of the legendary reindeers. Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen. Comet, Cupid, Donder, Blitzen. And then there's the leader, Rudolph. It's the red-nosed reindeer leading the pack. I see~ So I'm going to go register for the test. What about you, Miharu? Hmmm... I might take it since there are benefits. This year's exam may be particularly difficult. What? Really? It's just a rumor, but... A new hire, from Powson Nerima Kitaguchi, is a confirmed reindeer. Hmm? I think I just heard a strange vocab... There's nothing I can do to compare myself from someone from Powson Nerima Kitaguchi, though. We'll do what we can. What? Why would you compare yourself to me who was a part-timer at that Powson? What kind of joke is that? What?! You're from Nerima Kitaguchi Branch? What? No, there can't be that rumor. Because I'm the one who worked at the Nerima Kitaguchi Branch... Hey, hey, hey! For real?! Really?! It's you Sir Miharu! This is destiny of destiny! Kai...za... Destiny! Destiny! Glad to be working with you! You're real? What? Huh? How did you get here? What? Me? For some reason, a Black Santa screaming Merry Christmas to me! I was like BAM and was like, this is really bad! And I was like this is absent mindedly the best! And now I'm here! You're real! This inability to explain is definitely the real deal! Is he your colleague from the Nerima Kitaguchi Branch? Well, um... I see. I'll leave you two elites. Kindly excuse me, the commoner. That's too frank! Being called an elite is too ironic. After working for three years as a part-timer, I guess it's only natural for people to think I'm a loser. Sir! What's with those eyes?! To think I had been your fun partner for three years! Stop! Let go! Stop! Let go! Stop, stop! Stop! Let go of me! Hey, let go of me! Stop it! Stop it! If you please. Okay! Good luck on the exam! Thank you. You're going to apply, right? Come on, apply here. Hm? Do you have late night work experience in Powson Nerima Kitaguchi Store? Why is it asked again? What? Did you work there too? But unfortunately, a regular Powson Store won't do. Unless you're from Nerima Kitaguchi Branch. Besides, there's already one who applied this year. Is he blonde haired? Ah, yes, yes! He's promising. Apparently, his only coworker didn't work at all and was forced to clean up his mess all the time! Huh? Was he talking about me? What?! Was that you? It's true that you look like you're in a daze and totally useless~ No, no, that's... That's not me... Don't blame Kaiza. That's because being obedient are only praised until elementary school! Heard he was getting paid an hourly wage just by reading comic books. Yeah, heard every time he microwaves mayonnaise, he let it explode. I hear he's an usual offender of soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Heard he eats jellies with chopsticks. What? I heard he eats a scrapped lunch box at every meal! Letter of Rejection Rejected Miharu... Where are you going? Was that me?! All of that was you! Why are you here again?! Just when I was getting content, you've ruined everything! Sir! Thank you for having me here! Why are you here?! I brought a fun DVD~! Huh? What is this? The Christmas cards from Mom! He must not touch them! Wow! Amazing! There are so many! Could these be from your girlfriend, by chance? Shut up. Get out! Whoa, whoa, whoa? Seriously? Then, Shino... Is it okay if it's just the two of us in my room? He said you two were friends. Wait, wait, wait! Okay, Sir. Good nice~! Okay, okay! Okay. Get back! Oh yeah, the DVD! What did you bring? There, there, there. What the heck is this? Surveillance footage? Ah, is it from the Nerima Kitaguchi Branch? Oh, Shino, you got it! Wait, what? Don't say you wanted to show me these footage all along, right? You really haven't been seen this, have you? When I first got here Knecht showed this to me. - Knecht did? - Yes. Ah! It's almost time for the exciting part! Ah, I'm here too! Wow! It's so nostalgic, huh?! How did you get this? Oh, no. Customers are getting really pissed off at me. Isn't that just another day in your life? Wait, wait, wait, wait! What's wrong, Shino? You're pouting. Wait... Is this Kitaguchi Powson? Huh? You mean this is a normal day? Could this be a day where there are riots? Huh? I see. A girl don't go to convenience stores late at night, huh? This is normal. What? I'd say this is about 2AM to 4AM. It's like this every day for the most part. No, heard this isn't normal at all. Late at night, they don't get customers, so they've got too much free time on their hands to clean and stock up. It's supposed to be a battle against sleepiness! What are you talking about? The manager said our store is still one of the better ones... This for three years... Ah! What? One, two! Kaiza! Miharu! Congratulations on your graduation from Powson! Congratulations! Shut up! Oh my, Miharu. You worked really hard for three years. Um, I'm here to prove that you've completed all the courses. I am the manager of the Powson Kitaguchi Branch and also the director of Santa Claus House Training Center, Yoshikawa Teru. What can I say, Miharu. You know, you were, like, the toughest graduate I've ever had. I hope you will use your experience here for the children. Best of luck at the Santa Claus House! Congratulations! Good luck! Come, my sons. Make sure you remember the smell and keep an eye on it... Just in case... We don't want a child who could be a Red Santa to show up. They trained me even though I didn't ask for it. Three years... This name is Dad's fault. Wow! That's an aurora borealis! Listen, Miharu, from now on, when you feel you are going through a hard time, I want you to remember... The name Miharu means waiting for spring three times. It might be a cold winter, but by the time the snow melts for the third time, the scenery will surely change. Just when you thought the scenery had changed, that means you've changed. Why do I even suddely remember Dad? We will begin the reindeer exam shortly. Employees who have already applied, please gather in the study room in the department building. You really were from the Nerima Kitaguchi Branch. Yeah, I'm the useless one from Powson... It's the other way around, right? You don't even look like you came from Powson. You don't look like you're sitting next to someone who's busy working. Teppei... I'm sure you will be fine. Let's all pass together! Wow! It's like a barrier. The unpleasant atmosphere and Kaiza won't come in anymore. That's right. Right now, I only need to try to become a reindeer for now... Okay~! Everybody sit down! Okay, sit, sit... Okay, sit down! Hey, sit down! Hey, young man, don't a fuss. Okay. Sit down! Oh, my God! Hey, sit down! Jeez... Geez~ Sit down! Sit down! Jeez, sit... They're sitting. Well, I'm one of the instructors. Tanaka... Kaiza. Instructor?! Let's get along! Okay then. Let me explain the reindeer exam. Er, to be a reindeer, there would be an aptitude test that you'll take now and there will be a practical test. Well, we, the training's instructors already passed the aptitude test. And we'll only take the practical test. The aptitude test will narrow it down to half. For those who couldn't get through now, I wish you luck next year~! Suddenly only half?! That's too tough! Sir, I hope you don't fail... ...like you did in the university. You damn bastard! No. Calm down to my usual self. I have friends... Hm? I failed here last year too. Teppei, the perfect superhuman failed the test. Can I even pass this?! Okay then! Let's start the test right away. The aptitude test is a match with Santa Claus... ...by arm wrestling! No. What kind of aptitude test are you testing?! Wow! I was so scared of making such a weird face that I couldn't even take the grip gauge seriously... But Shino is serious! Okay, you lost~ Too bad~ Ah, I was so nervous. Next would be you, Sir. Me? Miharu, good luck! Good luck. Yeah. It's okay! Excuse me. Even so, I'm confident in my strength! I've been putting products into shelves all by myself for three years! Are those scrapped?! You can't do that! Hey! You can't eat the scrapped food ever! Do you hear me? Those three years... ...are absolutely not a waste of... Umm... What just happened? Am I down? Why? Sir! That's so like you! Excuse me. Have a seat. No, it's alright. I am rejected anyway, right? - As soon as we're done... - You pass. What? Actually, that arm wrestling machine has a scale. The more aptitude you have to become a reindeer, the more you lose the game. In other words, you who lost in an instant... Here. You can be a Red Santa, let alone a reindeer. Red Santa? Yeah. Isn't the Red Santa not here anymore? Where is he now? I haven't told you yet. The Red Santa Claus is... dead. He was murdered. What? Not everyone in this Santa Claus House loves Christmas. Among them... Are beings who eternally hate Christmas so much... And are called Rats. What are these Rats? They are beings who hate Santa Claus... No, hate Christmas from the bottom of their hearts. Those Rats killed the Red Santa 19 years ago. This Santa Claus House was created by the magic of the Red Santa. But now that the Red Santa is gone, that magic is about to be broken. When the spell is broken, we won't be able to make and deliver presents. Without the Red Santa, Christmas itself will be gone. To protect Christmas for children who look forward to it... there has to be someone who can be the Red Santa. Miharu, you have all the qualities of a Red Santa. I was sure of it from the time you were working part-time at Powson. What are you talking about...? Huh? Aren't you glad? Who asked you to train me? I just... Want to be a reindeer so I that I can think I didn't waste these past three years. I have no intention at all of becoming a Red Santa whose life is being threatened! If you say such sad things, I don't think Kaiza would be at peace. Huh? Kaiza? Why would he even... I told you. The leading candidates for Red Santa are being targeted by Rats. You were called here to take Kaiza's place. Didn't he took credit for your work at the convenience store as if they were his own, right? The Rats are now thinking they should get rid of Kaiza. I'm sure by now... What the hell are you doing?! Miharu... You see my face, don't you? Huh? What are you talking about? Of course I can see it. Dammit! You're the only one who can see my face. I don't have a single good memory. Kaiza! A bastard who has no good memories will die in my place. If that happens, this bastard will become a memory I'll never forget! Kaiza... Whoaaa! Oh my, Sir! You came for me? You should be in a safe place, Sir! These side characters can be taken care of me alone. I mean, you've always been helping people like me. Nothing has changed since five years ago, huh? 5 Years Ago Strawberry Daifuku Huh? What? Why is this full of strawberry daifuku? Are you a customer? Um, is this a convenience store? It's a convenience store... With 5 thousand strawberry daifuku in stock because of an order mistake, this is just a regular convenience store. 5 thousand? Ah, excuse me but I just wanted a rice ball. I have an test today and I'm in a hurry. We have that~ Ah, he is getting on my nerves. He take exams using his parents' money. Even if he fails, as expected he can take the exam next year. He's a rich boy. - Ah, Manager... - You bastard. What did you do with the order? Will you take responsibility for the 5 thousand daifuku? No, that's not me. Maybe it was Inaho... You bastard! Don't blame Ina. Ina has a pretty face, right? She's very, very pretty, right? Her face. Her face. Her face. Her face. Her face. That's what I'm talking about. Ina would never do such a thing. No, I probably have upset Inaho... Ina has...! Has pretty face, right? She's so cute, right? Her face. Her face. Her face. Her face. End of story. Wait... You know...! I'm clearly favoring her. Compared to her, you are, to put it mildly... ...a cockroach. Either you sell all 5 thousand daifuku or you buy them all. No, Manager... Manager! Wait! What the hell was that? Ah, excuse me. I'll buy a drink too. Hello? Ah! Kai! Thank you for paying off my debts a little at a time! Ah... Mother. Where are you now? Now? I'm in my darling's shop. I've stayed up all night yesterday and drank a lot~ Where'd you get that money? So, Kai, I'll be counting on you again~! Wait... Hey, Mother! Why is this always happening to me...? I'm working at my part-time job seriously. Then I go to bed and wake up with more debt... He's never had that kind of experience... Found a bad boy!

That's right. But how did you know...? I was working part-time until yesterday. Wow, they really got 5 thousand in stock. I'm starting to like this. Hey, was there a blonde clerk? He looks troubled, huh? Examination Supervisor Akai Inaho It wasn't me. Maybe it was Inaho... You bastard! Ah, hey, hey. Can I take a picture of this? This is so funny! Go ahead. Wow. Excuse me... You're really so cute! Can I take a picture of the strawberry daifuku with you? Yes, of course. Thank you. Okay, thank you. Here goes~ Thank you. No problem. One, ten, hundred, thousand... A million, huh...? Welcome~ Ah! There they are! I knew it was this convenience store! Strawberry Daifuku, the good luck charm! It's real! 5 thousand Strawberry Daifuku! Come on! Here they are, here! Come on! What? This is awesome! Awesome! What?! What's this? Ina@ Nerima Kitaguchi Pawson - 4 hours ago Oh no. I might have placed a wrong order... I may have been cheering for examinees, but 5000 might have been too much... (cries) Huh?! This isn't me... What?! Ah, yes, yes. Um, 2 pieces are worth 400 yen. - Excuse me! Excuse me! - Yes, yes? I'm buying these! I'm sorry, we're a little short on staff right now, so... So please fall in line... Ah, yes, yes. - He said they're short on staff. - That would be 200 yen. Please fall in line, please...! Please line up over here and wait for your turn! Let me help you. What? Ah, you're from this morning... There are suddenly many customers... I'll explain later. Let's sell them for now. Okay... Because this isn't something you should be should be responsible for. I've paid you back. Good morning. The reindeer practical test will be held today. Examinees, please gather at the study room in the department building. Okay! Ah! Dammit... Really, now... Whoa! This sure takes me back! I used to play with this a lot... Huh? I think I've met the Red Santa once... Are you there, Shino? I need to talk to you about something... Shino, I'm coming in... Smells like a girl... Huh? Miharu? Huh? How did you... What's up? Do you need anything? You see, do you believe in Santa Claus! When I visit a girl's room, I want to see her a little more vulnerable than usual. But she is too vulnerable! So you got this from a Red Santa? Oh, yes, I think so. But I have a vague memory of it... Shino's acting normal that's why I'm the one that can't ask! I see... This is a black card. What? Black? Yes, the most powerful credit card that is said to be able to buy even a lump sum of money with no limit! Huh?! You've never used it? No, I had that when I was a kid... Shaved head... Like a Buddha... I'd like to hear why she's like that. But I'm scared. I don't want to screw up. - What? - Huh? - Scary. - Scary? What are you doing? Hmm? I hacked into the credit card company's servers to look at the statement history. Your magic is definitely scarier, though! Hmm... Miharu, I think you used it after all. How can you tell? You purchased a lot in Amezin last 2004. What? Really?! I think I was 3 to 4 years old... But that was the time my dad died and my mom was in the hospital too, so... Ah, you don't have to remember. I just logged into your Amezin account. What?! Hey! Stop that! Just as I thought. What? Look. All you bought are toys. That's all the purchases you did. You really don't remember? 10 million... - Huh?! - Whoa! Ah! Miharu! Calm down! Um... I have the number for the customer service center. No, that's not it... We will soon begin the reindeer practical test. We would like to ask the candidates to please gather in the study room of the department building immediately. Let's go for the test for now. I'll look into it more later. Okay. The practical test this year will be Red Santa's Errands. You will go and hand presents to children. What? We would suddenly do the real thing?! No, but Christmas should already be over... Actually, in order to hand them out... Ah... There are children who, due to a slight mishap, were not able to get their presents. No way! Of course, you should give presents as Santa, where no one would find out. If you were found... ...you're disqualified. If you failed to distribute by sunrise... ...you're disqualified. If even one present is left out... ...you're disqualified. Understood? You're horrible if you forget! Got it?! Look who's talking. Okay then. You'll deliver in teams of four. This smell sure makes us hungry. Meat! Santa Claus meat! You know what to do, my lovely sons! Yay! Tokyo is really awesome! This takes me back~ Hey, we've come all this way. How about we go to Disney? That's a great idea! Then, shall we go to Disneyland and Sea? You sound like tourists! We can't do that! I'd love to go to the Mouse Castle at least once... Teppei, you too? Did you guys see how many we should deliver? How many presents did that guy forget to give out?! That's a suspicious amount to forget to give out. I'm happy that the information I found in Chimney is being used in this way. Hey, did you notice? We're finally handing out presents! The first and foremost we'll give is... This girl! Here it is! I think it's this one! - Wow. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! - Here, here. - Okay. All right! Okay, Sir. Let's go! What? Us two will go? Of course it is! We're buddies! I won't leave you~ We'll rendezvous together! Shino, how many minutes each do we have to distribute these presents to get them done by sunrise? - 3 minutes! - 3 minutes?! Shino and I will figure out the delivery route. Be sure to be back in three minutes. Go, it's time. Ready, start! What? Huh? Uh... Ah! We're gonna be late, Sir! Aren't you a little fast? Hey, hey! Wait! How do we get inside? Of course... ...with magic! What? What? Wait. With magic...? What? That looks like bad magic! Shh! Hey, your face... Your face... I don't like your face... We're gonna go in. Sorry to bother you~ Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. That was close! I feel thankful to be Santa! Don't push, got it? Hey, don't push! Don't push! Push! Don't push me, yet you push me! - Um, this is... for that. - Okay. Okay... This is it... Okay. "Dear Santa. I don't have a father." "But my mother is working very hard." "My mom always comes home late." "So I wish I had a friend to stay with me at night." Whoa! What a celeb~! So this is the last. The child is in the top floor. 20 minutes till sunrise. Let's hurry! But this place, of course, uses auto-locking, right? How do we get in here... Sir. We can do it. We're acting like thieves here! Whoa! Rats? No way! We gotta run, Sir! Why?! Why am I in this mess...?! It's not like I'm related to a Red Santa... Aaah! Sir! In the end, I'm... I remember now. 19 years ago, the Santa Claus that came to my room... Merry Christmas, Miharu. ...wasn't alone. This is a present to you. You can get anything you want most. Go on. You're a very good boy. Your father tells me a lot about you. Be sure to don't lose it. Thank you. You've got a package~! For mother, the shock of losing Dad was great. It took 10 months for her to leave the hospital. Click. Okay, round and round, and round. Okay, okay. Done. But even so... Click. Okay. ...I wasn't sad at all. I'm home~! Mommy's home! Miharu? Mommy~! Welcome home! Miharu, what's all these? What's going on? Santa Claus gave... Ah. Miharu! Wait! Hold it right there, Miharu! Don't open it! We have to return it... Miharu? Where are you looking? Miharu... I'm sorry... I also... Miss your daddy... Only when I heard my mother say those words... I realized that the person I want the most is... ...is never coming back... I'm sorry... The bank account is safe and there's nothing missing from the house either. With what money did he afford all these toys? It's very messy but I can't just throw them away... Mommy, are you troubled? I'm sorry. It's okay. It's my fault for leaving you on your own. It's not that big of a deal. Mommy, are you okay? Mother soon collapsed from overwork again. I had just understood my father's death, and I was aware of my mother's death. I was very scared. Just call if you are in any trouble Yes? Santa... Please help my mommy. Miharu...? I'll return all the toys. What's wrong? If there is a toy, Mommy gets troubled and get a stomach ache. Aren't the toys what you really wished the most? As Santa, I can't just take them away... They're not! I didn't get what I wished the most. What me... What me and my mommy wished the most can't be gotten anymore. I see. If mommy will also disappear... I... Miharu. Would you like to be Santa Claus? What? Me? Yes. Your mommy is troubled if she finds toys, right? Then it's better to give the toys you have to children who want them. But we'll not give them without a reason. We receive a lot of letters from good children. The letters that say exactly what they want the most... I'll do it! I'll be Santa Claus! It's going to be a fun Christmas. This toy wasn't what I wanted the most. I'll make sure all of them would be what others would want the most. Just in time! Now all I need to do is get these to everyone's house... I have to do my best... Everyone's waiting... What should I do? There are so many... You're amazing! Even the wrappings are perfect! Let us do it. From here on out, it's the reindeer's job. At that time, I was thinking... "I wish Daddy was in that truck." Are you okay? Are you hurt? No. Even though that was quite an impact... Wait... So you protected me. Where are the Rats? They're gone. But if they find out you're alive, they might attack again! Let's hurry and run! It's Kaiza! This is an emergency! Yeah, we were attacked by a swarm of Rats... Yeah. That's right... Since that's the case, we're backing out... Yes, we'll be right back! - Wait! - Hmm? What is it? Knecht, if we back out... Don't worry about it. Huh? You're talking about the exam, right? I'll take the results into account. No! You call yourself Santa?! What about the present? We don't have a choice. We're giving up on that child just this year. I'm more concerned about your lives... You've got to be kidding me! Because... There's a child waiting for what he wants most. It's Christmas! He's the only one... Where he won't get what he wants the most... I absolutely hate that! Hello? You're up... You sure haven't changed. There are no Rats now. So we can make it! We'll be ready to run anytime. Guys... Okay! Kaiza, let's go! Alright! You're almost there! Two more floors up! Thank you, Shino! We can see it! Thank goodness... but... We'll die! If we fall off this high, we'll die for sure! Goooal! This is it! Sir, the present! Yeah! So you were hiding! Dammit... - Oh no! - Oh no! Whoa...! There's more than awhile ago! This many is really bad... Climb to the rooftop and get yourself in position. You can get into the building from the rooftop. I'm now using the power of the Chimney and I'm unlocking the security. There! Dammit... So that's the boss. It's aiming for you, Sir. I'll clear the path to the door. You should run! 10 seconds till the security at the door would deactivate. Five seconds! Now! Four! Three! Two! One! Teppei! Rats are entering through exhaust vents. They are coming in from everywhere! It's coming! Teppei, you are very strong! Miharu! Hurry up and give the present! 10 minutes till sunrise! Dammit! Teppei! Kaiza! Get away! You should protect the present, Sir! But... Dammit! - Sir! - Miharu! Miharu! No... Miharu... Rudolph? Knecht asked me to come. You're late... Miharu is already... Miharu! What? Huh? Is he okay? Now that's a close call! That was frightening! How long are you gonna laugh? Hey, hey! Hey, how long are you gonna laugh?! You're really amazing, Sir! Come on! Hurry and stand up! What? Here. You go give that to him. It's your job after all. Okay. Merry Christmas. Who's there? Santa? Thank you, Santa. Okay then... Congratulations to all of us for passing the reindeer test! Yeah! Cheers! Thanks for the food! As always, Teppei's cakes are the best! But, Sir Miharu sure isn't coming. He said he has something to discuss with Knecht. Knecht? He's not here? Be sure to don't lose it. Dad... Why are you here...? Do you think you're ready to take over the Red Santa? What do you mean my dad's the Red Santa? Just what is going on?! I'm sorry. It's under contract not to tell anyone for being a Red Santa, even for his family. Because the Rats will get him. Did they kill my dad? You want to know? Of course. If you want to know... You'll have to be the Red Santa. Dad... Geez... I'll do it then.
