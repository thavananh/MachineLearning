Don't believe everything you see online. My sad face here is because I had just ran six miles with my son George and I was starving! - Training for the half marathon. - Woot, woot, woot! - So, how does that make you feel to see that? - It makes me feel like people are not getting the real story about me. I'm happy and I have a lot of interesting things happening. - Well, what do you have going on? - Wouldn't you like to know. - Guess we'll just have to tune in later then. Guess you will. - Is that what I think it is? - Well, it's December, isn't it? - Did you make these? - Hmm! I'm not gonna buy them when I know how to make them myself, right? - Look at the comments already, Mom. People remember you. You should share more. - Wouldn't you like to know. Why are you pushing this? - You could tell your story. Set the narrative. Not to mention make money. Also... women might be inspired by someone like you crushing life. - I'm crushing life, huh? - How many recognizable women over 50 are on socials? Like, really sharing, not their PR team? You could. - Be an influencer. Like you. Oh, I don't know. I've been out of the game for so long. And everybody's so judgmental. - I'll help you! - Ah! - Come to Aspen with me? - What? No. No. I can't anyway. Your father and I agreed, it's his year. - I'm inviting you. And the only reason we're going is 'cause I have that snowboard collab and Dad's meeting people for work. We could do some dual content together. You could turn to ski. - Oh, or I could sit by a fire with a book and some wine. - I promise you won't have to see Dad. - Oh... I wouldn't mind seeing him stuck on a chairlift. - Liese will be there. - Oh, even better. - When was the last time you and Dad talked? - Mm... we talk. Mostly about you. - Well, I just thought this was a way I could spend the holidays with both of you. - Honey, I'm sorry. I know. It's hard for you to go back and forth. We did spend some great Christmas times together, didn't we? - Dad always to buy the biggest tree on the lot. - Oh, it took two days to decorate that thing. - But it was magical. Every night by the fire. The best part was the unlimited cocoa. - That was the best part! - So come, drink cocoa with me. I mean, what else do you have planned? - I have plans. Actually, I have a date tonight. - Wait... what? - Yeah. I'm seeing someone. - You didn't tell me! - It's not a big deal. - It's a huge deal, Mom! What's his name? When do I get to suss him out? Okay, well, he... also is recently divorced. And we were just planning on spending some... low-key Christmas time together. Wow. He's early. - You won't even know I'm here. I'm just gonna ask him a few questions about... - No, no, no, no! No, no. You're gonna go out the back door. Leaving. You're leaving. Hello, handsome! Ooh! - Delivery for L. Riley? - Uh... yeah. Thank you. - Hey, uh, have I delivered here before? - No, I don't think so. - Oh, yeah! I know! You're the wife of that sportscaster! Ooh, lemme get a selfie. Hey, thanks! Ex-wife. Hmm, hmm. "Sorry to cancel. I have loved meeting you, but I think I'm going to give things another shot with my ex. You're great." I'm great. George? Great at cookie making. Why not? Aspen, here I come. Hm! 40 minutes... - Tremblay for Chalet des Neiges? - You're going to the Chalet des Neiges? - I am. - So am I! - Oh, well. Nice. Hopefully, you got yourself a ride-share. - Oh, they're so backed up. - Yeah, well, there's a big ski event at Big White. - Maybe we could split the fare? Or you know what? I'll cover the whole thing. How's that sound? - Um, there's no space. - There's only you. - Me and, uh... six boxes. - Wow! You like your wine. They're for the hotel. I hand-selected them and pre-booked a cab. - Well, I don't mind holding them on my lap. - I actually do. So... - Oh, come on. You're not gonna leave a damsel in distress stranded at the airport at Christmas, are you? - I'm not sure you can still call yourself a damsel. But have no fear. - I... - I'm sure a cab will come along soon. There's flights landing all day. - Oh! You don't socialize much. Do you? - Wait. Are you a guest of Chalet des Neiges? - No. I just like taking rides to random hotels. Yes, I'm a guest! - Please... take my cab. - Are you sure? I... - Yes. - I mean... thank you! We can still share! - No, no. I insist. - Okay! Well, I'm confident that another cab will come along shortly, you know. There's flights landing all day. Just... pardon me while I... grab my bag. ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Your leaves are so unchanging ♪ ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪ Thank you so much.

Hello! - Do you have a reservation? - Do you work here? - Sort of. Do you have a reservation? - Well, yes, I do. Lex Riley. Okay. - I don't see you. - Do you think that there's an adult member of the staff I could speak with? - I'm sorry, but there is no reservation for Lex Riley. Is it under a different name, perhaps? - L-E-X R-I-L-E-Y. - May I see the credit card you made the reservation under? - Um, are you sure there isn't someone else I can speak with? - There's my uncle. Désolée, êtes-vous ici? J'ai une dame devant moi qui n'a pas de résa, mais qui veut parler à quelqu'n qui n'est pas un enfant. Bon... - Are you French? - My grandma is. - Oh. Is someone coming? What a pleasure. Aw, the gentleman. I assume another cab showed up? - Dining room needs to be set. She was delivered. - Oui, merci. I got delayed. I leave for a few days and it all falls apart. Can I see your confirmation e-mail, please? - Oh, actually, I didn't get one, um, but I did definitely make the reservation last night about 6 p.m. - 6 p.m. Ah, yes, we had a cancellation, but another party reserved it. - So... my reservation didn't go through? - Shall I call you a cab? - Don't you have any other rooms? - The week before Christmas. - Do you have a sister hotel? - We're a family-run establishment, not a motel chain. - Anything at all? I could stay at your house in a guest room. Well, we do live here and uh, no, thank you. Well, unless you want to pay me to build a new room while you wait for it to be finished, I'm afraid your money's no good here. Now, if you'll excuse me, I do need to take care of some tasks since we're a little short-handed. Good luck to you, Damsel. - You can ask her. - Ask me what? - There is one room. - Which is wholly inappropriate. - I'll take it. - It's for a chalet girl. - A chalet girl? - Chalet person. It doesn't have to be a girl. They help run everything. Cleaning, cooking, manning the front desk. - So you're in need of a chalet person. - We had two until Helen quit yesterday. - She didn't quit, she just had to finish her contract early. - So you need another one now. - We'll manage. - We're not managing. - Until the temp agency finds us someone. - The week before Christmas, really? Rent me the room. - We need it for staff only. - Fine. I'll do it! Chalet girl... person's not for you. - You need help. I need a room. Let's make this happen. - No. - We could help each other. - You'd have to scrub toilets. - Do I look too good to scrub toilets? - How do I answer that? - Darling, I was the head of every one of my son's PTAs from pre-K 'til senior year. I ran the bake sales, the cake walks, the birthday parties, the Halloween parties, and don't get me started on the Christmas festivities. Do you know those hotels, where they change the entire decor four times a year just to fit the season? - We are one of those hotels. - That was my house. - Your home must be nice. - Thank you, honey. Now you are obviously understaffed, resorting to child labour. So tell me what you need and let me do it. - If you want to be a chalet person, who am I to stop you? May I show you to your room? - Aren't you going to offer to help me with my bags? - May I take your bags? - No, you may not. It's part of my job. - This way. - I knew that. Oh! This place is so lovely. - Well, I'm afraid your place isn't quite as grand. Anyway, here we are. - I crushed that run. Charles... Oh, no. Oh, not yet. - You alright? You okay? - Oh, yeah. I just, uh, I found this on the ground here and I wanted to put it back 'cause, you know, someone could trip on that, hurt themselves. Look at me! Helping out already. It's perfect. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, it's even more lovely than the suite I thought I booked. - Oh, glad to hear it. Well, your first day has officially started. - Okay. Well, that doesn't seem like it's gonna take too long. - And this is for you. - For what? - To wear. - Uh... I'm going to jump into this full throttle like I do everything, and I'm going to do such a good job, you're not even gonna notice that I'm not wearing that. - I really hope you take this seriously. I mean, this is the most important time of the year for us. It cements the chalet situation, keeps us a member of our luxury hotel association. I mean, without that, we... well, we just can't compete. - I won't let you down. - Thank you. Okay, so we need to prioritize setting up the dining room, then you can start at the top of the list. I'll meet you in the kitchen in 30. - Where is it? - Follow the Christmas smell. - Hi, everybody. So, I thought you might be up for some truth. And the truth is, I followed my son George to this boutique hotel in Aspen. I messed up my reservation. Note to self. Always follow through with your confirmation code. So, as a woman who makes lemonade from lemons and has worn a lot of hats, it seems that the only way that I get to stay in this establishment is by wearing the hat of a chalet girl. Oh, person. So stay tuned. I seem to be able to make an adventure out of anything. - Oh! Okay, you must have read my mind. Thank you. You are the sweetest. - I know. - And modest, too. Duh. - Mm. Good coffee. Where should I start? - With her. - Are you lost? I can show you to your room. - She's the new Helen. - Her? - Me. - You. - Me. - Why are you a chalet girl? Aren't you Lex Riley? - In the flesh. - Is this some kind of hidden camera reality show? Oh, I've always wanted to be on one of those. - Well, no, it's not, but now that you mention it, that's kind of a good idea. - So are we really gonna be cleaning together, like the floor and everything? - The floor and everything. Like I told your boss, I was head of the PTA, I ran the parties and catered the luncheons, so you don't have to worry about me. I have the skills. So, are we gonna chit-chat or should we get to work? - It's nice to meet you. I'm Nicola. - Lex. Let's go. - Get to work, ladies. - Yes, ma'am. - That's the best I've seen those look. What's your trick? - I sing a little song in my head. When my son George was little, his dad would put on Christmas music and then George would start dancing around. And I started putting the lights in to the beat of the music. And George thought it was funny, so it sort of became a tradition. Musical tree lighting. Yeah, I sort of can't remember a tree that didn't get lit to some song. - Hm, really? - Yeah. Let me show you. Alright, like this. ♪ Merry Christmas, baby ♪ - This is genius. Can I record and send to my mom? She'd love it. - Oh, of course! I'd love to make your mom happy. - Ready? Three, two, one. Hi, everyone! So, I am at the beautiful Chalet des Neiges in Aspen, and I am reporting to you live from my life now. So we all know that putting the lights on the tree is the most difficult part of decorating, but I'm gonna let you in on a little secret that I've been using on my tree forever, and this one is for Nicola's mom. So, you're gonna use the beats of the music, the two and the four, and you just end up placing them randomly, and it's fun, and it comes out really pretty! - Oh, look at you two having fun. Huh. Glad to see you two are getting on. Here, can you take these to room 7? - Sir, yes, sir! - Hm. Uh-huh... Oh! - Hmm. - Do you think this will uphold your luxury hotel rating? I finished everything on my list. - Uh-huh. Oh, great. All you have to do is the other side of the list. You used both sides. Don't waste paper. - Eric. Est-ce que le déjeuner... - Maman. Que fais-tu ici? Everything is under control, the pipe leak in room 5 is fixed, breakfast is finished, and I hired a new chalet individual, Lex. This is my mother, Céline. Céline, this is Lex. - Hello. - Ah, bonjour. - Hello. - Ooh my, did you do this? - Oh, well, I... I've thrown a lot of parties. - You're more... experienced than our usual lot. I needed a room. Nice to meet you. - Hmm... très bien. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, we all know that changing bedsheets alone is the worst. But I have this hack. And so you have to let me know if this is a commonly known thing or if I am a bed-changing genius. - Don't forget to empty the trash. - Oh! Sounds like I've got another job to do. Okay, so this is what we're going for, for our final look, alright? So, we folded it over to here. So we're gonna do this corner and this corner, folding it here and fold here. Then we go underneath and we pull that up a little bit. And now, we've almost got it. And we're gonna do this one. Isn't that pretty? - Yeah! - That's how you make special napkins! Hi, everyone! So I believe it is never too late to learn something new. So I just picked up all of my skis because I'm gonna learn to ski! And you might ask why and I would say, "Why not?" So if you're going to come along for the ride, this is a run through of everything you're going to need. Um, so first, you're gonna need a helmet and some... Oh! Oh, there goes my ski! Ah! I gotta get it! Oh! - Are you okay? - I'm fine! Thank you! - Oh, yeah, you keep doing that, you're gonna twist a leg or something. - Oh, okay, Drama Queen. - Got a ski lesson scheduled? - No, it's the week before Christmas. They're all booked up, but I have been watching videos online. Oh, uh... Yeah, no, no, no, no, that's not gonna work. - Oh, ye of little faith. - Let me give you a ski lesson. Well, don't you have, like, tea to pour, and stringing lights, and fluffing pillows? - You know, normally I would, but somebody already did it for me. - Oh! Who could that have been? - I don't know. But maybe I could give them a ski lesson. On the house, of course. Have some time out. - Ah, that's an enticing offer. - Oh, good. Shall we go? - Well, actually, my break is over. Sheets won't change themselves. But if you could make yourself available at my lunch hour... What can I say? I love my job! - Mom! - Hey! I thought you were hitting the slopes. - I was, but I've been seeing some of the videos you've been posting. - And? - I love them! People are loving them. And you're racking up the new followers. Keep it up. Which room are you in? - Um, well, uh, it's... not exactly the suite that I booked, but... - Mom, you know what? You can just stay in our suite. - With your dad and Liese? Uh, no, thank you. - There's lots of room. I can sleep on the couch. - I would rather stay here than come face-to-face with your father's midlife crisis. - Why are there cleaning products in your room? - Because I'm a chalet person. - You really like chalets now, huh? - Did you not watch my videos? I thought you... Okay. You know what? Just film me and I will explain it to you. Okay. Hey, everyone, Lex Riley here coming to you from my room and board situation in Aspen, Colorado. Now, even though you are used to seeing me reporting from the red carpet and now I am vacuuming them... - Wait, you're really vacuuming? - Yeah! Shh... I have fully embraced my chalet duties and I will be bringing you the secrets on cleaning and cooking and fluffing and buffing and... at last, I am going to spend time with my son George! Oh, look at how handsome he is! Because he's the reason I'm here in the first place. So! Grab your bag of popcorn because the behind-the-scenes of this amazing chalet are going to be worth watching. - Mom, when I said sharing, I meant, like, Christmas how-tos and foodie tips, not brushing toilets and God knows what. I... - But I'm reporting again and I'm connecting with people. And did you see the comments? You told me to crush it. Am I not crushing it? - Mom, people are expecting celebrity-level glamour. How are they gonna perceive this? Well, this is my story, George. I... I don't know. It's... It's honest. It feels right. If I was 20 years old and doing this, nobody would bat an eye. So what's wrong with being a chalet person? - What if this goes poorly? What if they post misleading photos of you vacuuming lobbies? - Then I'll be the butt of everyone's jokes, including your father's. But it's okay, because my truth will be out there and I am having fun. Ow. - Aw, I love you. You go have a good time with your dad. Wish me luck! - Good luck, Mom. - Hmm. Ugh! Ugh! Why are all men the same? Oh, Lex, you're such a moron! You did not think this through. - Whoa! - Hey, Charles! - Lex? I... Are you...? Are you, uh... you trying to come on to me? - What? - Well... - No! No, I... I work here. Uh, temporarily. I'm... Uh, it's a sort of a... work for room and board situation. Um, I'm a chalet girl... person now. - Ch... chalet girl? - Housekeeping, Charles. Uh, as you know, George invited me and when I got here, there were no rooms, so you know, I just figured it out like I always do. - Huh. So... how do you like Aspen? - Oh, well, uh, it's uh... it's pretty nice so far. And I hope it's okay that I came. I know that we agreed that this year was your turn with George. - No, no, it's fine. You shouldn't miss out on seeing him at Christmas. Neither of us should. - Well. - Are you okay, Lex? - I'm fine. - 'Cause if you're not... - Really. - So are you just... cleaning now? Or I mean, there's a spa in town? - Oh, I'm... I'm actually focusing on making content. Like social media? - Yeah, behind-the-scenes of the hotel, and me doing this. I'm actually having a great time. - Are you just trying to get back at me for the... - What? Charles, not everything is about you. No, I'm having an adventure. - What will people think? - Who cares what people think? I mean, I think people might actually enjoy the transparency and the honesty. And speaking of honesty, how's Liese? - Mm. I... She... - You know what? It's alright. Just... you don't have to answer that. I... It's none of my business. Look, I'm not here to make trouble for you. I will just do my own thing and I will make sure that you have another chalet girl to take care of your room 'cause this is awkward. - Would you like to join us Friday for a pre-Christmas brunch? George would like it. - Well, yeah, that would be nice. - Great. A group of us are gonna ski at the Queen's Gulch in the morning. I assume you'll skip the run and just join us for brunch after? - No, no, no, I'll... I'll join you and George. - Really? There's no pressure, Lex. No, no, I'll be there. - Great! I will text you the details. Wait! Uh, this is my room. - Right. - Yeah. Sorry. - Just, uh... - Oh boy. - You're welcome. - Oh, hey. Can Nicola clean room 12 from now on? - Of course. - Thank you. Oh! How difficult is Queen's Gulch? - How strong is your skiing? - What's slightly steeper than a bunny hill? - Pretty much every run. - Oh, I haven't done it since I was a kid. - Well, Queen's Gulch is one of the most difficult slopes. - No. - Yes. - Charles invited me to ski with him and George. - You want to go? - Mm... It wasn't that long ago that all three of us spent Christmas together. It might be nice if it was possible. Anyway, I'll manage. I'll just get out there on the bunny slope and take a couple runs. It's probably like riding a bike, right? - No. ♪ It's my favourite time My favourite time ♪ ♪ My favourite time of the year ♪ Tell me, if this is a commonly known thing, or if I am a bed-changing genius. Look at that! Hey, I'm here! - I can't believe so many people are excited about beds. - Oh, don't pretend you're not impressed. Nice ski suit. - Thank you. - Would it kill ya to wear a little colour? - Oh, well, see, I think you failed to notice my Christmas pin. - Oh, wow! Oh, that's just glaring. Wow, you are pushing the boundaries. - Well, colour's not really my thing. No offence. - Come on. With your love of food and wine and every little detail, I don't believe that. - Well, maybe black just gives me a blank canvas to work from without getting distracted. - Hmm. I can appreciate that. Where's the car? - We walk. Everything's close in Aspen. - Oh, okay. - Always look forward, not down at your skis. - Never look down. Okay, I think I'm ready. - Wait, wait, wait. That stance isn't quite... Hop up and down. - Hop up and down? - Like a bunny. - Are you joking? - Well, it doesn't have to be high. Your feet actually have to lift off the ground. - My feet have two big sticks strapped to them. - Trust me. Hop up, land, and don't move. Ah! There! Exactly the right stance. - Is that why they call it "the bunny slope"? - I have no idea. - Well, I think we should try to get moving. - Yeah, just flex your ankles, keep the weight centred over your feet. - Okay, you're gonna have to shush 'cause I have it in control. - Pizza! French fries! - Pizza! Ooh! I think that's going to take a little longer than I thought. - Yeah, maybe next time... don't shush me. - Shh! Thank you so much for helping me today. - You were making some really good progress at the end. - You want to say that on camera? - Are you kidding? - No, I am not. Hi, guys! Um, I have been having a ski lesson with the lovely Eric, and he's gonna tell you an update on my progress. Oh, uh... We still got a long way to go. Eric! He just said I did a good job. - I'm not gonna lie on camera. - Well, I wouldn't want you to. Okay, but it doesn't matter. I am not giving up. I am gonna get this one bunny hop at a time! You! - I have you all checked in. Thank you for choosing Chalet des Neiges. Enjoy your stay. Bye. Hmm. Hm. Hi. - So, who's the silver fox? - A ski instructor. - Is there an après-aprs-ski? - George, what do you want? - You look like you're having fun, that's all. - I am. - Good. I'm happy you came to Aspen. - Me too. - And this hotel BTS stuff might actually work, especially with Mr. Salt and Pepper. What's his name? - Eric. And thanks to him, I now have two hours of turndown service. - Turndown for what? - Hotel turndown service. For the guests. Those little chocolate mints don't just magically appear on your pillow, George. I'll see you later, honey. I have finished everything on my list, front and back sides. - Oop. Except for the afternoon tea. - What? The afternoon tea? - Mm-hmm. - Christmas tea. We serve our guests tea and cake. - Bonjour, maman. - Bonjour, petit. Why don't you get a lunch together for us while we set up tea? Unless, of course, you've already eaten. - No. Uh... Do chalet girls get to eat? - Sure. Strict 30 minutes. - Ah, why don't you fold some napkins? - Okay. So, how long have you, uh... had the chalet open? - Almost a century. - Wow! - Yeah. Mom really put it on the map after moving here in the 1960s, after she left Paris. - What made you move from Paris? - Uh, a boy. - Oh. Ah, the chalet had been in the Tremblay family for... well, since it opened. It made sense to come back here with Eric's papa. - Yeah, I remember hiding behind a desk, just like Aurélie does right now, watching everybody come in from skiing. I think that's where I first developed my love of wine. You know, just watching everybody laughing and smiling, drinking their Beaujolais, Burgundy, Bordeaux, so many good memories. But ever since then, all I've wanted to do is travel to those regions. - Oh! He covered his walls with maps of wine regions from all around the globe. - Really? I would have guessed race car wallpaper. - Oh, don't get me wrong. I love race cars too and cars, but Mom really did put this place on the map. Excuse me. - It was a great place to raise Eric and his sister. It became my passion. Sometimes I think it's a... And I wonder if it's Eric's passion too. Ah... He's been such a great help to me. His sister passed in an accident, and there was no one here to look after Aurélie, so... - Wow. - He worked so hard to keep this beautiful place to respite from reality that it is. Hm. But enough about us. What brought you to Aspen? - Oh, that's a long story. Hmm... The best stories are. - I was supposed to spend the holidays with a man, but that didn't work out. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, don't be. No, I'm just testing the waters. I only got divorced a year ago. - Were you together long? - 21 years. - Oh... May I ask what happened? - Yeah... Charles and I, uh, met at work. We were young, ambitious, in journalism. That's something we shared. And we got married, we had our son, and I stopped working. We thought that was best. I love being a mom. But Charles, he just didn't wanna give up that big life and... I just wanted to be in bed with a book and the baby monitor. Yeah, so he didn't want to curb his own desires and he didn't. - Hmm. - So now, I'm an empty nester and single again and, uh... trying to figure out my next move. You seem like you have done it all so gracefully. What's your secret? - Move. Move? - Really. Moving, oh, opened up my heart and mind. Replant your strength. Find your value. - Well, I used to think my value was my career. But I might have aged out of that. - Hmm. I think our value is tied to what we love. - Hmm. I love people. I love hosting them and meeting them and connecting with them. Actually, my son, he's really into this whole social media thing, and he thinks that's what I should do. Pivoting on my recognizability, I guess. - It's your second act. I'd listen. Ah! - Lunch is served. - Merci, mon petit. - 30 minutes, you're on the clock. I know, I'm going to eat fast. Ooh, hey! Beautiful lady! - Whoa, what's going on here? - Age. - Well, that's enough of that. Let's get a shot of coffee in your bloodstream. - Oh, no, no, no. I've got a bed with my name on it. Come on. What's the point of being a chalet girl if we can't have a little fun? We earned this. Ladies' night! - Okay, I guess... I guess a little fun can't hurt. Plus, I think you need a wingman. - I do. See you soon! Wait. What? - I was hoping she wouldn't be here. - Why? - She'll never let me in. She's mean to everyone. - Oh, it's gonna be fine. Just smile. You'll see. Hi! - No. No, no, no, no. Absolutely not. You know the policy. - Policy? - No chalet girls. - Oh, chalet people. That's the policy? - That's her policy. She doesn't think that chalet people should mingle with tourists. - This is an exclusive establishment. With standards. - Mm. - Who are you? Her mom? Um, uh, no, I'm not her mom. Although, I would be lucky to be her mom. No, I am... Lex Riley, and we are live from a club where she won't let us in because we clean for a living. Or was it my age? Yeah, she asked me if I was a mom. She must have something against mothers. Um... I didn't realize. - Oh, she didn't realize. Oh. I think we're gonna get in. - Oh, yeah. I'm sure we can work something out. - Aw, thank you, dear. Go ahead in. - Thanks. - Here, this is for you. Merry Christmas. We'll just step right over this. - If you... - Hmm, thank you. - Thanks. - Ooh! Pretty. Cheers! - Mm! - We did it. It was right. You are amazing. - Aw. - Thanks for getting me in here. - I'm just glad it worked. What do we think? Does it live up to the hype? It kind of does. So, what's the deal with room 12? - Mmm... My ex-husband is staying in there with his 30-year-old girlfriend. - Well, if it's any consolation, you're much nicer than his girlfriend. - You met her? - She demanded a total change of scent for the suite when they first arrived, and didn't understand why I couldn't immediately go and buy her new candles. - Oh, well, empathy is not her strong suit. - So, why are you here then, if they're here? - My son is here too. And I guess I kind of thought that maybe there'd be some way for us to have some little family Christmas time together. - Mom! Hey! - Oh! Hi! Sweetheart! Um... George, this is Nicola. Nicola, this is George, my son. - How's it going? - Uh, it's, uh... Um... it's going, uh, so good. Yeah. Yeah. - So, Nicola recommended this place. Isn't it cute? - Yeah, it's great. - I was saying to your mom that this is my third season, and I've never made it past the hostess's angry stares before. - Well, that's probably just 'cause she's jealous of you. - Jealous? - You know, 'cause, I mean... - Oh, um, someone tell me, how long do you think it will take me to learn how to ski? - You? No time at all. You'll have it cracked in 24 hours. - Nicola, that is the correct answer. Why didn't you say that? Mom, I... Give me a break. Hey, everyone! So I promised you some behind-the-scenes at this luxury Chalet des Neiges, so let's do it. Here are some insights of how you can bring a little bit of this Aspen magic right into your own homes. Let me know what you wanna see in the comments. It's rolling. Now you may not know this about me, but I am a passionate cook. But George here... - Is not. - Until today. This is George's festive little showstopper. - I did have a little help from our glamorous assistant. This is Aurélie, and she is gonna help you learn how to make it. - Hi, guys! You're gonna need these ingredients. Some holly and a yogurt pot. - Baby, if I can do it, so can you! So, essential oils are good. But if you don't have that, you can use cut up apples and oranges, I've got some cinnamon sticks here, and we're gonna dump cloves right into the pot. Oh, it's like I could eat the air. So, for storage management, you are going to need to invest in one of these. I just used this label maker to organize this entire ski room. I had one of these when my son George was growing up, but I lost it. Mom brain! So I'm gonna put this one in my suitcase. Ho, ho, ho! - Are you being Santa now? - Well, aren't we all? What's the matter? Am I embarrassing you? Always. Do you want us to add your name marks? - Add my name to what? - Secret Santa. - Oh. - It's a Chalet des Neiges tradition. - Just don't tell Uncle Eric. He hates it. - I don't hate it. - You just think it's a massive waste of time and money. - Well, I just think there's enough pressure on everybody at Christmas to buy gifts. They don't need more pressure at work. - Well, I think you're forgetting that people like little surprises. And it's one way to show affection. - I know how to show affection. - I didn't say you didn't. - Are you playing or not? - Fine, I'm playing. But $20 max for everybody. I don't want anyone to feel pressured. - I love a challenge. - Of course you do. But whoever I pick is getting a $20 gift card. - Wow, Eric! Way to bring your Christmas spirit. And no big public gift exchanges, young lady. - Oh, fine. It's Secret Santa. People can do it secretly. You wanna pick first? - Sure. Uh... got one. - Alright, let's make our rounds. ♪ Jingle Bells Jingle Bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way Hey! ♪♪ - Oh, it's so beautiful. You must love living here. - Could be worse, that's for sure. Can I make a... slight suggestion? Yeah, what is it? - Try putting the phone down. I always say you could photograph something or you can experience it. Very difficult to do both. - No, no, you're right. I'm just trying this new thing where I'm reconnecting with people on social media. Trying to reinvent my career. - How so? Uh, well... I mean, 25 years ago, I was a reporter. And then I had my son, and so I stopped working and basically took care of him and my ex-husband. And now that there's room for me again, I... I don't know who I am. I don't know what to do. I don't know what's next. - I actually understand that more than you might think. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, it's like... it's just not as easy as I thought it would be to jump back in. It's like a ship sailed and I'm not on it. But I mean, I'm not sorry. I wouldn't do anything differently. - I guess we're not always in control of our journey. I mean, life offers up situations, and sometimes, it just doesn't turn out the way you think it will. - Mm-hmm. But the sun's coming out. - It really is. - And that's a perfect time for a picture. Smile! It's relentless. - Is that it? - Yes, this is the company that gave me the board. I gotta get some action shots. - Nice, congrats. - Yeah. - And hey, uh, what's with this new girl you're seeing? Wouldn't you like it to know? - Here you go. - Oh, Lex! Hey! Hey! - Thank you for another great lesson today. - Oh, you are so welcome. And I'm so sorry if I was a little hard on you up there. It's only because I see so much potential. No, I appreciate it. - Eric? Can I please borrow you for a second? - Absolutely. I'm so sorry. Would you just excuse me for one second? Hey, Lex. I know you're not scheduled this evening, but would you mind helping us out in the kitchen tonight? - Oh! No, sure. - I promise I'll make it up to you. - No need. Lex! - How do you keep doing that? Practise? I have a surprise for you in the living room later. - You do? Well, I can't wait. You wanna help me pass out these candy canes? Sure. Do you like my surprise? I sure do. ♪ O'er the fields we go ♪ Laughing all the way ♪ Bells on bobtail ring ♪ Making spirits bright ♪ What fun it is... - It's really pretty, isn't it? - Don't you wanna film it? - This is for us. ♪ Jingle bells jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh what fun... ♪ - Okay! What are we doing? - It's a Chalet des Neiges pièce de résistance. Which you know nothing about because we haven't told you. The eight-course Christmas tasting menu. It's why everybody books to stay here. Once you've tried Celine's food, you'll beg for 10 courses. - Taste this for me. - What is it? - Chestnut stuffing. An old family recipe. - Hmm! Like I ate a Christmas village. - Oh, bon, I'll take that. Ah, you know your way around the kitchen. Assist me. Uh, batonnet those carrots. So... Aurélie showed me the videos. - Oh, what do you think? Hmm... it's cute. Young people will love it. - Why does that not sound like a compliment? - You have more to offer, Lex. Emotional wisdom. Not just the journey. How. Hm. - We could really use an extra pair of hands serving. - Ugh... Do you mind? - Wow. Lex Riley! Charles told me you were here. - You remember Liese from my management team. - Oh, we never really met. Lovely to connect. Isn't this place spectacular? - Yes, it is. - Good evening, everybody. Hope you're having a nice evening. Our next course will be a wild-caught pepper-crusted salmon, with chestnut stuffing, herb emulsion, and Parmesan foam. Hope you enjoy. You know Liese and I aren't serious, right? - You do realize she's sitting right beside you? - Yeah. I just wanted to let you know that... we aren't. - Why would I want to know that? - Looks good. Thank you. - Help! - You got this, Mom. - Do you wanna grab a drink later? Oh! - Ooh, that's... - Oh! Pardon me. I hope it didn't burn. - No worries. - Not the first time. - It's... That is warm. - Take care, guys. Good night. - Great to meet you, Lex. What a treat. You too. - We should grab a family drink or meal later. Wouldn't that be nice? - Oh, that'd be sweet. Uh, well... goodnight, Lex. Everything okay? - Why wouldn't it be? - Well, I'm not blind, that couldn't have been easy having to, you know, with your ex. - Yeah... - Maybe I could make it up to you. Meet me by the fireplace tomorrow after Christmas tea. - This is uncharacteristic of you. - Mm. I have my moments. Have fun cleaning up. Hey, everyone. So, I am having a wonderful time sharing with you my newfound grab-life-by-the-skis approach, but something happened tonight. Um... I know that most of you know that I'm divorced and empty nesting, looking forward to whatever's next in life, but things, um... they haven't been always easy lately. And I know that's meant to be and... I'm happy. But tonight, I found myself at a holiday dinner with my ex-husband and his new girlfriend. Guess what? It wasn't that bad. I survived. Well, my feet didn't survive, 'cause they were in these all night long. I mean, obviously, it was... it was a little awkward, but it just... it made me think about how we're all really going through something. And so, I don't wanna be here just to give you cooking and cleaning tips. I want to talk about something that's real. So tonight, let's talk about interacting with your ex. ♪ It's that time of year ♪ When Santa comes to bring that cheer ♪ ♪ He ain't comin' by boat or plane ♪ ♪ He's loaded down with candy canes ♪ Hey, guys! So, I've had a great day today, mostly spent cleaning, did a little bit of skiing, and now I'm getting my first real break. So what does a girl wear for her downtime? This is too formal, right? Yeah, too formal. And this... probably... too skimpy. I think too skimpy. So... I'm down to blue and cream, blue and cream. So let me know which one you like best. And just for context, I am a single woman in her 50s and I like to keep it classy... which, all of that is a subject for another day. Alright. ♪ Here I am ♪ Hanging up the silver lights ♪ Dreaming you out here tonight ♪ ♪ Sitting right here by my side ♪ I'm glad to see someone else did a costume change. Whoa. I thought blue won. - Are you spying on me? - Well, for what it's worth, I voted for cream. - Ah! - I thought maybe I could show you some bottles of wine that we have. - Ooh, I love that idea. ♪ Hanging up these Christmas lights ♪ ♪ Under the mistletoe all alone ♪ I love this one. - It's criminally underrated. - All this knowledge about wine, is this a hobby or...? - Well, like my mom said, as a kid, I was absolutely obsessed. So the moment I turned 18, I moved to Europe. Every varietal, every note, every region a wine could have or come from. It's pretty much my first love. So I became a sommelier. I had some big plans for wine. - Oh... Where did you do that? - Mm. I settled in Bordeaux. - Oh. I've never been. - Oh, it's a magical place. Dream job, winemaking. You'd love it. - And you gave that all up to come back and care for your family. Wow. - That was the right thing to do. - Sorry about your sister. That must have been so hard. You know, most people wouldn't be able to manage that kind of sacrifice and loss. You really think you have to give up your dreams completely? I mean, maybe there's a way back. - Not everybody gets that. - What about when Aurélie gets a little older? Maybe you could start again. It's never too late. - Until it is. - Well, I for one am not giving up. I know that youth has the opportunity, but age has wisdom. And I am wise enough to know a good heart when I see one. And I am looking at one right now. - Sorry to interrupt, but I have a huge group of guests that just arrived and need some help. I... it's my cue. - It's my cue. You're taking the night off. - No, no, no, I... - I insist. - Okay, well, I'll just... drink all of these, then. - Please do. - You're very sweet. - Well, not that sweet. Tomorrow's your last chance for a ski lesson. I want you to get some rest because I am not taking it easy on you. - Mm-hmm. Wine! Why? Oh! Oh! Um... oh... Okay, yes. Okay. Hey! You two are both here. We just arrived here at the same time. - And you're both wearing purple. Cool. I gotta go. - Uh... So... purple. - Yeah. - George? - Wow. - Just ask her out. - It's a nice day, isn't it? - Are you ever gonna ask me out? - I'm trying. Want to go to dinner tonight? - I would love to. - Thank you. - I don't know how you get anything done with all of this right outside your front door. - Oh, responsibilities. But sometimes, I forget how much I love this. - Really? - Well, with our discriminating guests, there's always some urgent need that's the most pressing thing in the world. - Am I one of those guests? You're one of us. - Ah! Okay, not to be insultingly obvious, but maybe you need to hire more help. - Well, my mom can do it. So can I. - Well, Celine has had you. - We manage. You're seeing us at our peak season of guests and stress. But the preview Christmas dinner tomorrow, that's the most important thing for us. - Yeah? - Travel bloggers, luxury hotel association, they're all there making their yearly judgments, you know, making sure we're keeping up with the excellence that we're known for. - Am I pulling you away from the chalet? 'Cause we can go back. - Making time for this lesson, that's important, especially with Queen's Gulch tomorrow. - Okay, since it's almost Christmas, and I know you don't like the Secret Santa thing, and it's not a gift card, but I couldn't resist. George helped me. I thought you could do with an upgrade. - Oh, wow, I love them. Thank you! Oh. And they change colours! - Okay, if you don't like them... - They're perfect. If I would've known that we were exchanging gifts... - You... I didn't expect you to... We picked each other's names? - I actually picked Aurélie, but she and I saw these and thought you should have them. Yeah. Yeah! They may come in useful tomorrow. You just... fit them in your gloves. - Okay, well, I'm gonna... I'm gonna use them right now. - Alright. Yeah, sorry about the shape, but they are effective and rechargeable. - Help me with this one. - You got it. There you go. Slip it in. How's that feel? - I feel like someone's holding my hand. - Oh, love it. - Merry almost Christmas, Eric. Merry almost Christmas, Lex. Want some help with that? - Nope, I got it, boss. - Wow, you don't need me anymore. Oh, I wouldn't go that far. - Alright. - Race you to the bottom? - What? Alright. Deal! ♪ With the lights all bright in the shopping mall ♪ ♪ Everything around me glitters like a disco ball ♪ ♪ But my heart's not into it ♪ The gifts are wrapped beneath the tree ♪ ♪ Everyone is laughing ♪ Celebrating, feeling free ♪ ♪ But my heart's not into it ♪ You're actually incredible today. - You are complimenting my skiing. - You should be proud. I mean, the progress you have made. You'd never know that you hadn't skied in 50 years. - You have a way with words, Eric Tremblay. - I am being serious, though. Queens Gulch is a tricky one. I want you to remember everything I said. - Yes, coach. - Stick to the group. - I will. - Nothing crazy. - Yes, sir. - You're gonna be golden. - You sure? - I'm sure. What? You want me to say it on camera? Would you? Yeah, I would. - Actually... I think I'm gonna keep this little victory just between us. At least I won't be embarrassed in front of Charles tomorrow. - Yeah... - What? - I... I just don't think you should go. - Well, you just said you thought I... - It's not about your scheme. - No, I promise I'll make it back to help you with the big dinner. - I just think it's beneath you. Standing there watching him fawn all over another woman. - Oh! I don't think there's gonna be fawning. I... And I'm a grown woman. - Forget I said anything. - No, I... I think it's sweet that you wanna protect me. - I think you need to be treated with more respect. - Well, I don't disagree. - You have plans tonight? - Other than turndown service. - Got a little surprise for ya. - Okay. I like surprises. - Hey. - Hey! What are these for? - They put you in staff quarters? - Well, I am staff. - Huh. - Thank you. - I want to apologize for the way that I dealt with the whole Liese situation. I should have called and given you a heads up. - A heads up? - I owe you that. - You don't. - I respect you, so yes, I do. And I won't make that mistake again. I miss you. - Charles, I don't know what you want me to say. - I don't want you to say anything. But seeing you this week... I don't know. I don't know what it is I'm asking, but I do know that I wanna try to say sorry to you for everything. - You don't have to say you're sorry. - I've messed up, over and over again. I took you for granted, Lex, and I realized it too late. And I miss holidays together. Just the three of us. - Yeah, um... That's what makes divorce so hard. Things change. - I remember Christmas morning pancakes and champagne. And how George would make us guess the gift before opening them. - Why are you doing this? - Can I take you to dinner tonight? Maybe we can just talk. It would be nice to catch up... properly. - Yeah, I could... do dinner, I guess. Oh, wait, no. No, I can't. No, I have plans. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. They're not with that receptionist, are they? - Eric? Yeah, actually, they are. - Figures. - What does that mean? - I see the way he fawns over you, like a goldfish interested in the new shiny thing that traipses through his chalet. - Am I the shiny thing? - Of course not, that's not what I meant. - Listen, he has helped me a lot, and that's been nice for a change. - Lex, I'm pretty sure it's his job to be nice. Everyone here works for tips. This whole town runs on tips. It's transactional. You're just the latest guest to come through. And wait... the two of you don't have plans that are gonna get in the way of our date tomorrow, do you? - No. And if George wants me there, I'm gonna be there. - Great. And for the record, it's not just George who wants you there. - It won't be a very good date if you spend all night getting ready. - What are you talking about? Date... What? We're friends. There's no pressure. - Uh-huh. You go for candlelit dinners with all your friends? - Aurélie, don't tease your uncle. Everything is perfect. - Merci, maman. What do you think? Should I lose the tie? - Eh, too stuffy. - I thought so. - Aurélie, come on. Let's get things started in the kitchen. - How about... now? - You look great. - Are you sure? - You got this. - Aw, thank you. See you later. Thank you. - Everything okay? You seem a little reserved. - Oh, yeah, um, I'm fine. I ran into Charles earlier and... I guess he just got me stirred up. You know, I think the holidays always bring up feelings. - What kind of feelings? - Mm... Melancholy, confusion, the desire to eat an entire box of chocolate. - That's understandable. What if he's showing you his true colours? - What do you mean? - Well, personally, I see a narcissist. An arrogant, selfish person. - Yeah, I get that. He wasn't always like that. That's the confusion. I'm just being real. - Hmm. - Mm. You know your wine. So... what do you want? - What do you mean? - Uh, out of life... This... this candlelight dinner with me. What is it that we're doing? - Truthfully, I haven't wanted to date or even put any effort into it in a very long time, but I have to admit that... you've changed that for me. - Hmm, hmm. - The last time I was in love, I lost that because I chose to come home. She just couldn't handle the long-distance relationship. Not that I blame her. - It's hard to open your heart again, I get that. - Mm. Maybe. I'd like to think that I'm open to doing that for the right person. - Well, if you wanna find the right person, you have to be willing to let someone in. And let go of some control and compromise. - Uh, I think you might be overstepping. - Oh. Uh, I'm... I'm sorry. Eric, I... I have really enjoyed meeting you and well, everybody here has been so helpful in me finding myself and getting my head in a better place. I don't know if I'm the right person for you. - Well, I don't know if you're the right person for me either yet. - Oh! Okay. - Yeah, I just thought we'd have a beautiful dinner and have a little fun. - Dinner and fun. Okay, yeah. We should have dinner and fun. - It's not what I meant. - This Malbec is perfect. - What about you? What are you looking for? - Well, I was looking to find myself and I figure if I find myself, I'll find the right person for me. - Well, is that why you're looking into the past? And coming here for Charles? - I came here for George. - Is that why you're going skiing with Charles tomorrow? - Now I think you are overstepping. - I just don't understand how a wonderful woman like you with so many great qualities, would even consider putting up with a guy like that. - Well, I don't think that you know what I do or do not put up with. And I don't think you, a man who has basically buried his heart and his passion behind some big wall of family duty is in any position to tell me how to have a relationship. - Hmm. Well, if that's what relationships are these days... that's not what I'm looking for. - Uh... I think I should go. - What? No, no, no. Lex! - Do you... want to talk about it? Oh... I don't know. I don't know, maman. You know, people come and go through here, but... I stay. - You've been part of something the world appreciates. The chalet, Aurélie... I'm so grateful for you. It's never bothered you before. - I've never met someone like her before. - Hm. Then she's the right one. - What could I possibly offer her? - An honest heart. - Hm. Ce n'est pas assez, maman. - Ugh... Of course it is enough. Ah... the chalet was my passion. I'm sorry if you thought it had to be yours. An honest heart is... also patient. - Peut-être. Je ne sais pas. - Oh! More than maybe. - What I do know is that we need to start focusing on Christmas as a family. Mm-hmm. - Did somebody say Christmas? - Yeah! - Because I've been having some thoughts about presents. - What a surprise! - You come here because I want to tell you something. I think you are so special. We're going to get you whatever you want to have. What do you think about that? Is that the best? - Tell you what, last one to the kitchen gets to make the hot chocolate! Argh! - Okay, let's get this show on the road, shall we? - Where's George? - Oh, didn't you get the text? He's gonna meet us at the bottom. - No, no, I didn't... I didn't get any text. - Oh, well, that's what he's doing. Oh, and the brunch, it's more of an early dinner thing now, but don't worry. We'll have plenty to hold us over until then. - Okay, well, I have to be at the Christmas preview dinner. Hey! Guys, good to see you! - Oh, shoot! Let's go! Wait up! Uh, come on, hey! Hold the door! No, wait, Charles! You're kidding me! Oh! Can I come with you guys? Thanks for waiting. - Sorry, Lex, but I'll be right behind you. - Okay... - Okay? Oh, come on, guys, it's not a race! - Okay... - Okay, fine. Fine! - Just remember what he taught you: stay with the group. You gotta be kidding. Oh boy... Okay. You got this. Okay. Okay. Here we go. - First time? - Oh! Is it that obvious? - You should probably stick with the group while you're in the trees just for safety if you're a beginner. - Yeah, I wasn't supposed to be alone. Thanks. I came, I skied, I am still walking. - Okay, so, there we are, all of us trapped in this room, nowhere to get out. I swear, that's exactly how it happened. - You're right. - Right? Couldn't go anywhere. - Charles! - Hey, Lex! You made it! - Barely! What happened to being right behind me? - Oh, now, don't get mad. - Did you even wonder where I was? I mean, I could have been hurt. - But you're not, so what's the big deal? - Well, the big deal is that you... you don't stick to your word. You say things, and you don't mean them. - Come on. I knew you could do it. I mean, you can do everything. - I can't do everything, and I can't do everything alone, and I don't want to. - Lex, I... I don't know what you expected. I can't be there holding your hand every single moment. - Yeah, I know, Charles. I know. You're right. I knew that about you. You can't be there holding my hand every single moment. Oh, come on. I do. I mean, I came here today because I hoped you could be different. And even though we're not married, I thought... maybe we could still be a family, for old time's sake, for George. Where... where is George, by the way? - He stayed behind for some girl. Nicola? - Yeah. I think that was her name. I have to go. But... wait! Lex, it's Christmas! It... - You know, Charles... We're always gonna be George's parents. And I'm always going to wish you well, but we're not a family. I know where my family is, and I'm gonna go to them. Lex! - But Merry Christmas! You too, ladies! Merry Christmas! - Honey, tell us about that time that you were in the group with the explosion. Well, right. That uh... that was crazy. So we're in the airplane... Hey, guys! Okay. So, I just realized that family can be anything. Family can be what you make it, and when you find your family, you don't ever let them go. I got a preview dinner to get ready for! - Looks like my snowboard company sponsored me for the rest of the season. - So does this mean you're gonna be spending more time in Aspen? - Oh, I'm definitely gonna be spending a lot more time in Aspen. A lot. - This is my third season in Aspen and it's been by far the best. And I can't wait... to school you on the slopes. - Bring it. - Oh, you two! I can't stand it, you're such a cute couple! - We missed you! - Oh, I'm sorry I'm late. How can I help? - Ah. Soup. Stir soup. - Where's Eric? I need to speak to him. - Um... he was pretty broken up after your dinner. I'd never seen him like this. I'm not sure what's going on but he promoted me to assistant manager and said something about Bordeaux, and he left. - For France? - I overheard him calling the taxi. - Oh? Oh, oh... Eric! Eric! Oh! Oh! Eric! - Oh! - Oh! - What are you doing? - I was trying to stop you! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - You don't have to apologize. I was rude. I was pushy. And you don't deserve that. You've done nothing but help me. - And put you to work. - Well, yes, that too. The other night, I... I think I was just scared. Meeting you, I think I felt right away like we could be something together. I felt that too. - It's been a long time since I fell... - Fell? - I think you know what I'm trying to say. - I think I do. - Please. Please don't go to France. I mean, yes. Go back to Bordeaux at some point, but just not now. - What? France? Oh, no, I'm not going to Bordeaux. I'm going to pick up a case of Bordeaux. - Really? - Yeah! - You're not leaving? - Leaving? Lex... No, I... I'm not leaving here. I'm not leaving you. Oh, wow... I think maybe, um... From now on, I'm just gonna stay wherever you're at, at Christmas. - Well, if everything goes well, maybe we can spend one Christmas in Bordeaux. - Maybe we could share a cab. - Or we could just keep sharing this. ♪ Here I am ♪ Hanging up the silver lights ♪ Dreaming you out here tonight ♪ ♪ Sitting right here by my side ♪ ♪ Next Christmas ♪ You'll be here with me ♪ Putting up that Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Just have to wait and see ♪ 'Til next Christmas ♪ I miss you by my side tonight ♪ ♪ Hanging up these Christmas lights ♪ ♪ Under the mistletoe all alone ♪ ♪ And I'm waiting for you to come home ♪ ♪ Here I am ♪ Hanging up the silver lights ♪ Dreaming you out here tonight ♪ ♪ Sitting right here by my side ♪ ♪ Maybe next Christmas ♪ You're gonna be here with me ♪ ♪ Putting up that Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Just have to wait and see ♪ 'Til next Christmas ♪ Difuze
