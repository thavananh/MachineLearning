Lose that, I'm sunk. I call it Peter. Do you know why? The church is built on a rock called Peter. Is it? That was a joke, lad. An ecclesiastical pun. You were supposed to laugh. [cymbals strike] Know your catechism? Uh, my godfathers and my godmothers and my baptism when I was made a member of Christ, a child of God, and inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven. Well, you won't inherit much at that pace. Whiz in, whiz out the other side. Just to show I know it. So you should, lad. Living here, God's own country. We got it all here, lad.

It's not mad, it's a miracle. Miracles are mad. Well, what do you know? Anything can happen. Anything, see? How do you know? Reverend Thirle said so. God said so. God doesn't know everything. He does so! Oh, look, there's Jesse. [inaudible] ANNOUNCER [ON RADIO]: Jesse Cabot is on his back. McCreedy has Jesse Cabot on his back. Every time Jesse tries to sit up, McCreedy just pushes him down again. Just pushes him down again. [ted being annoying] Good lord! Good lord, Jesse Cabot just stood on his head.

UNCLE JIM: I wonder much they pay him. DAD: Must do pretty well. - Oh, pretty well? What, a heavyweight champion of the British empire? He'd be a made man, wouldn't he? Of course he would. A made man, Christ. Do you mind not saying Christ? Mind you, the guy's my hero. Uncle Jim, what's a made man? A made man? Oh, somebody special. Somebody who's got it all going for him. Jesse Cabot would be a made man. He could have just about anything he wants. Who needs wrestlers? I need wrestlers. Jesus, if it wasn't for the wrestling broadcast, I'd go nuts. - Thanks. Thanks a lot. Well, you know what I mean. Yes, Jim, I know exactly what you mean. DAD: Now, now, no squabbling. [kids whispering to each other] That's a good brew. Dad? Hm? Could you do-- What?

If you want to win, you've got to train! Train. Yeah, like Jesse Cabot! Get strong and fit. OK, boy. You start. Well, pick them up. Eh? Pick up the rocks and run around. But they're heavy, boy. That's the idea. Oh, come on, Firpo. You've got to try it. Come on, Firpo. Get them up. Come on. [straining] Get them up. That's it. Now get them out front like Jesse Cabot. That's right. Come on. [thud] Come on, Firpo. Pick them up again. - Too heavy, boy. Yes. Now! But when you get used to them, don't you want to win the race? A made man doesn't need rocks. Firpo, you do so or you'll come last! No, boy, you don't understand. Firpo's going to win. Firpo's going to be the made man. Made man can do anything, boy. Told ya. Made man. [playing the piano] [parents arguing in background] Get every note right at double speed, Firpo will win. [banging piano keys] TEACHER: Page 118, top of the page. I wandered lonely as a cloud that floats on high o'er veils and hills, when all at once, I saw a crowd. A host of golden-- Yes, you Crome. Bring it here. And what might this be? A made man, sir. The made man. I see. This thing, this gargoyle, this heap of steaming muscle is the summit of all human endeavor, is it? I don't know what you mean, sir. This is what your friend prefers to words with. Now, listen to me, all of you. This cult of brawn over brain you are going for can lead a country to ruin. I don't need to remind you of what's happening in Europe. You can read the papers. I didn't think I'd find it here, after all, you're British. We were until a little while ago. I didn't think the British would run off so soon. Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, all British. Oh, what's the use? Keep your vile hands off beauty, boy. All right, Crome, waster of time, deaf to poetry. Back to your seat. You will write up for me 100 times the pen is mightier than the sword and brains will go farther than brawn. You still on about muscles? Have you been getting plenty of exercise? But it's not for me. It's for Bob-- I know, Bob Harnnett. Well, diet's important. Yes, plenty of meat. Bodybuilding substances. Steak, chops, liver, all that. Kidneys are good. How much meat can I get for that? That's a lot of meat. Your mum ran out of ideas, eh? Yeah. GEOFF: Firpo! Firpo! Over here, boy. Ah, look what I've caught you. What is it now, boy? Another present. Oh, more rocks. No, look. Ooh, what's this for? It's for you to build your body up for Sunday. You've only got two days. Oh no, boy. Don't eat meat. It's cruel, killing things. Vegetarian, Firpo is. Firpo, you are not! What about all those shellfish? Oh, no, they can't feel. They don't know, but animals, they feel. They know. But how are you going to build your body up for Sunday? Fit! Fit as a fighting tomcat, Firpo is. Made man, made man, made man. Made man, made man-- - Stop it, Firpo! Stop it! - Made man, made man, made man. Stop it! What am I going to do with this? Dunno, boy. [clattering] Mum, here's a giant for you. Where did you get that? Butchers, where else? - How much? - 15 bob. 15 bob? Geoff, that's all your savings. Why? Present! Oh, dear. Oh, that's very sweet of you, but how am I going to keep it? I don't know. [bed squeaks] Silly fool. Ask and it shall be given unto me. Well, you know at Christmas you said that special about a virgin? Old, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and she'll call his name Emmanuel. Was that a miracle? The miracle of history, lad. A virgin shall conceive. What's a virgin? Oh, laddy. You do ask some awkward questions. How old are old? 12 and a bit. Well, you're old enough to know now if you don't know already. For a child to be made, there must be a mother and a father. You do know that, don't you? Yes. Yes, well, um, now you-- you also know about the organs that-- that function in this connection? Yes. Well, our Lord had no earthly father. He was conceived by Mary, but fathered by the Holy Ghost. Yes. That's a miracle. Oh. Are there still miracles? Well, here and there, they say. Funny things have happened. How do you get one? Oh, laddy, I don't know what this is all about. You want something, don't you? Yes, but not for me. For someone else. I see. Well, you can't get miracles by wishing for them. You can't bully God into giving you them. What do you have to do? You have to earn them like the Saints, pass tests. What tests? Faith, virtue, endurance. Do you pray? - Yes. Good. Very good. Prayer is good. - Prayer. Prayer. Now, off you go. Let me attend to the miracle of growth. Yes, Mr. Thirle. Thank you, Mr. Thirle. [band music] Woo-hoo! Firpo! Firpo! [firpo crying] Firpo? [CRYING]: No, no! Firpo, what happened? No. [inaudible] I can't do it. Yes you can, Firpo. [inaudible] No. Come on, Firpo. You can do it. Like you said, [inaudible] and what will Firpo be? Come on, Firpo! What will Firpo be? Made man. Yeah, that's right. Made man. But you've got to earn it, Firpo. You've got to pass the test. What test? Faith, endurance, things like that. You're Firpo's friend, are you, boy? Yeah, of course I am. It's going to be all right, Firpo. Made man, eh boy? Yeah, made man. You'll see. - Made man? - Yeah. Made man. - Made man. Yeah. Made man. Made man. [inspirational music] Made man. Made man! Made man. [breathing heavily] Woo! Hey, fit as a fighting tom cat, Firpo is. Woohoo! Woohoo! Woohoo! [crowd cheering] Yes! Yes! Yeah! Yes! Firpo! Yay! Firpo! Thank you. I just want to say that I owe all my success to a young boy in far away New Zealand who stood by me when all was grey. Cheerio, one and all. [applause] [choral music] CHORUS: Praise the lord! Praise the lord! Listen, I want to talk to you about a man called Firpo. Listen, God, it's really important. CHORUS: Sing praises to our lord. How can God listen to that much? He must be deaf already. Please let us remember, it is a song of praise. Listen God, quick. You've got to help Firpo. You've got to make him the made man, God. Make him the made man. One, two. Tomorrow morning, God, please! Please, God! Crikey. CHORUS: Sing praises to the lord. Sing praises to the lord. Sing praises to the lord. Shut up for God's sake! [music abruptly stops] Who's there? What are you doing here, lad? Praying like you said. I also said you cannot bully God into giving you miracles. You can't ear bash him in his own house. You'll put him off. He won't listen. Won't he? No he won't. You must come to him with respect. You can't profane in his house. But you're all making so much noise he couldn't hear me. Noise. A magnificent of my own composition in four parts. Did you hear that, choir? We have a critic here it seems. Now, listen to me, boy. If you had come here with a civil tongue in your head, I might be prepared to listen, but God does not like cheeky little boys, and neither do I. But it's important! I've got to talk to him! Not in that frame of mind you won't. God does not listen to naughty boys. Now, go! [tapping] [tapping grows louder] Deaf old bugger! [gulls crying] Your father wants to see you. What about? You'll soon find out. Come on. Mr. Thirle's been on the phone to your mother. He said you made a disturbance in the church. He was rehearsing the choir. There was so much noise in the church, he couldn't hear me. Who? Mr. Thirle? No, God! Mr. Thirle was right. You are ill-mannered and insolent. Now, come over here where I can see you. Sorry. It's this Firpo coot, isn't it? Oh, come on, boy. I know what's going on. The whole beach knows. It's this ridiculous race tomorrow, isn't it? Are you mixed up in it? Well? [sighs] I hope you don't think he's going to win, because he's not. Why do you think they're doing it? So they can have a good laugh, and it'll be you they're laughing at, mark my words. Don't be too hard on him, Alec. Oh, for God's sake, May,you're as soft as he is. Now, listen, boy. I told you before, you stay away from that chap. He's a lunatic. Suddenly, right out of the blue, for no reason at all, people like that, they can go stark raving mad. How do you know he isn't dangerous? Go on. Go to bed. And tomorrow, you stay well clear of him! But he's my friend! - Dar God. - Oh, Geoff. I don't know, boy. You seem determined to get yourself into every kind of mess you can. I mean, why can't you just-- just be normal? I'll tell you one thing, if you were any kind of a friend, you'd tell him to stay home tomorrow. Now go on, go to bed. He's going to lose the race tomorrow. What do you know about it? All the kids from school are going to be there. Have a laugh at the nutter joker. Well, I don't know what you're going to laugh at because it's not going to be like that. You're as nutty as he is. [suspenseful music] MAN: Seen that loony jogger yet? Keep your eye on young Joe Dyer. He's the man to pick. Right, let's go, lads. Let's get this thing over and done with. Oh, we can't, Sergeant. The sty has arrived. I'm having no smart alecs here. Get that pipe clear. He comes, he doesn't come. I'm still starting this race on time. He won't come. He's too scared. The newbie? What a nutcase. Never fear, he'll be here. [laughing] GEOFF: Firpo! Firpo! Good day, boy! Firpo! You can't! You mustn't! Don't do it! Today's the day, boy. The made man. Come on, boy. Follow Firpo. Firpo! Come back! [dirge-like music] Firpo, no! Don't! Firpo! Firpo, don't. Firpo. Firpo, come back! Please, Firpo, don't. They're only going to laugh at you. No laughs at the made man, boy. But Firpo, you're not. It didn't happen. Come on, boy. Today's the day. You silly fool! WOMAN: Oh look, here he comes! All right, Sampson or whatever your full name is, hurry up. We're waiting on you. What's he doing? [people laughing] Firpo is ready. Well, at least he can't be last now. [laughing] [people cheering] WOMAN: Come on, Joe! Show him! Come on, Firpo! That kid's his pet. I am not! - Go on, sonny. - Don't you dare! Careful, Charlie-- Now, listen to me, you folk. I've got a pretty good idea why you invited me here. Well, that's not my business, but you're not going to make a Joe Hunt out of me. You want a race? All right, it's going to be run properly. Just so long as that's clear. OK, boys, gather around. Are you in this or not? Firpo is in. [laughter] God help us. OK, now you're not going to break. You wait for the gun. That's all you've got to do. Wait for that gun. There's no handicaps. Your course is up to the big three. The judges are there now. MAN: Ready when you are! Right. All clear? - Yes, sir. - Take your marks. Charm your heels, Charlie. Watch out for the skinny jogger. Are you ready? Get set! Can't you get it? It's not all that difficult, is it? Come here. Do they always jump the gun? Don't you understand English? Look at old Sampson there, he hasn't even moved. WOMAN: He probably can't. MAN: He's got rigor mortis. Take your marks. Are you ready? Get set! [gun shot] Good gracious! [exciting music] Go, Firpo! Go, Firpo! You did it! Come on, Firpo! Come on! [crowd jeering] What did I tell you last night? I've got to help him. [sighs] - All right. Give him his coat. Then you get up to the house. [firpo out of breath] Firpo, are you all right? Firpo? Here, put this over you. Don't want to catch a cold, eh? Ted, stay here. [firpo coughing] The man's fallen over, dear. That's all. Come on, Firpo. Time to go, eh? [clapping] Look, uh, only a joke, eh. Didn't mean any harm. Just a bit of fun. WOMAN: Joe, come on. Well, anyway. This man won. Didn't he, ey? See you around, ey? [laughing] [firpo coughs] Come on. [firpo continues to cough] [deeply exhales] Lie down, Firpo. You'll feel much better then. Come on. [firpo crying] Please don't cry, Firpo. You know why you didn't win that trace. You didn't build your body up. You didn't that meat. Man. Made man. But how could you, Firpo? You've got to have muscle power. You've got to. No, no, made man, made man. Look, Firpo-- listen, Firpo. I prayed to God, but there was so much noise in the church, he couldn't hear me. Next time I'll go when it's quiet, and he will hear me, and God will help you, Firpo. God? Yeah, Firpo. He will, he will, I know he will. No God. No God. God's a cheech. God's a cheech. Laugher. Firpo? You come to laugh at Firpo too like all the others. Laugh! - No, Firpo. You know I wouldn't laugh at you. We're friends. - Laugher! No, Firpo. We're best friends, remember? Laugher! No, Firpo! [firpo yells] [crashing] [firpo screams in anger] No, Firpo! Get out! Get out! Get out! [woman yells] Good God! You've caused enough trouble. Get out! [ocean waves] It wasn't your fault. Yes it was. No it wasn't, Geoff. You did your best. That's all anyone can ask. Sorry, dad. Yeah, so you should be. How do you think I felt watching my son behave like that in front of the entire beach? Proud, I hope. Come on, son. Eat your dinner. [melancholy music] [band music]
