With me, you can... Well... Mrs. Lamour... I love you! Mrs. Lamour? You're in great shape but... But what? You don't read too much, by any chance... Mrs. Lamour? Why? Because, there are some, when they read, it's... Say my little bunny... You wouldn't be telling me I'm too old for you, right? - No, it's not that, but... - So what? Well, here it is: 57. No problem... At 55, we make love! Attention. Straighten up. Head left... Smile. Don't look down. Raise your arms right here. We'll start. You start with your right foot forward, attacking with the heel... One! Put your body on top. Slowly... Left foot forward... Two! The body on it. Right foot aside... Three! Left foot back, very small, very small... No, it's too big! Straighten up! Put your body weight here... That's it! I... shall I take you home? Oh no! I'll never dance with you again! Alright Leon... You've still got some progress to make... Your turn Leon. Not bad! Hang on Leon! Hold the helm, sailor! Look, he taught me that too. Your turn. Your turn Leon. I forgot the oversway. - Behind swivel. - How's that "behind swivel"? You're out of place. Backward and oversway. Can we do that, then? Immediately out of place. - Oh here! - That's right, perfect! Is it good Mr. Georges? - Lags a bit on the slow. - A little slower on the slow? Drag on the slow. With me? Mrs. Valentine? Get-up. And Doudou and Roméo? Fired... Good, they were... They were jerks! No, Leon, budget cuts. So what? You're not the best, but you're the cheapest... Thank you Madam... And the most honest! Thank you Madam... I've got a Brazilian who's taking me to the Caribbean. Couldn't it be me? - Do you know how to dance bossa nova? - The tango! So you'll stay here. Thanks Mrs. I'll pay you more. Thanks Mrs... I'll have my locker? Yes, Leon. Someone there? A sauna, a shampoo, please. - Well... Camomille, camphor or sulfur? - Sulfur. And a toothbrush, with a tube of Sexodent. Sorry? A toothbrush and a tube of Sexodent. Thanks Lulu. - And in rhythm please! - Yes boss! - What's your name? - Nolly. - Good evening Lili. - Good evening Leon... - When will we love each other? - Not today Leon... Tomorrow? Not tomorrow... Not after tomorrow... Not saturday... Not sunday... Monday? Hi Leon! I'm knackered all of a sudden... Can I rest for five minutes? - Fumée? - Yes? I want it but... I don't have any money. Too bad... For free? My foot! Who do you take me for? - Leon? - It's me. Sometimes it's a freebie... But you have to seduce me... Smooth talk? Uh... You're great! You're curvy... You give me chills almost everywhere uh... Your eyes are beautiful! Your skin... Well... That must be something! - Isn't my spiel any good? - Oh yes! But that's not what makes me melt. - But what is it then? - I don't know! It's guys who are not ordinary. The guys who do smooth talk like that, I see them every day. What I like is people who have something special... ...something of their own. You understand? - I've got nothing, me... - Ah... Oh yes! I've got this! The tango, now that I know, and I like! So what? You know or you don't know? Come! Come dance the tango. Think about love... Close your eyes... Leon, you are the best! You're the best but you do in a Musette way... Do you know the Argentinian way? I don't know it but I don't like it... I simply don't know it... Learn it! It's more sex! - Won't we dance together anymore? - I dunno... Hi Leon! Don't be sad, my loulou! If I said to you: "You're great, curvy." "I get chills almost everywhere" "It does things to me that I really can't say." "Your skin is beautiful. Your skin... it must be something." Afterwards she said to me: "Think about love." It's smart! "It's too soft." "Learn the Argentina way." "It's more sex." You see, it works with you. Well your tango... it does nothing for me at all! You're lying. No. I'll remind you that you have an appointment in five minutes with your teacher. I know, but I don't know anymore... I'll come with you? I'm not your manager? It's finished for today. Thank you. Try to be as good as me heartbreaker! I no longer have a partner. I wanted to flirt with her and she slapped me. Oh, that's not a problem. I don't want to dance like a musette, I want... Argentinian style. There's no longer an Argentine way. - There's no longer an Argentinian way? - No. The tango has evolved. New techniques.. Really? It's beautiful! But it's mostly with this that you have to dance! - With what? - With that! And sometimes it comes all of a sudden! Leon, close your eyes. Go ahead! Bring me Fumée. Fumée please! He didn't tell me what he wanted, but he wants to see you. You haven't missed me too much lately? How's it going? Don't move! What do you think, Mr George? You'll go very far... Photo? Life is beautiful, isn't? To dance... Gift of the house! - Can you bring me a shampoo? - Do you want me to bring you mine too? Oh Leon! Come and see! What? I don't have my glasses, tell me how much I weigh? I don't know how to read... How much Leon? You like bad news? Leon, how much? Damn... If I can say... - I don't know how to read! - Watch out Leon, you won't weigh up! With who? You? Look. 55! 55 what? You know what happens at 55? Well no, I don't know what happens at 55... Liar! At 55 we make love... Here? Ah! You're kidding, you're kidding! - I can't Mrs. Lamour... - Why? I've just done it... - So you cheated on me? - Yes. Twice. With a girl like that! Oh Leon... Me who believed you pure and innocent, - like a newborn child. - The flesh is weak! Leon, I had so much hope. I understand... A bath. - Why? Is your bathtub broken? - Exactly. - When are we getting married? - When you have changed jobs. - You're kidding? - No! - Are you coming to live at my place? - No! Farewell then! Narcisse... you don't want your cocktail? Oh but yes, yes. Oh Leon! Come see! I, Robert Pottier, said Brilliantine Ramon. Say good day to you. - How's the tango? - OK. - How's the girls? - OK. - How's tango and girls? - OK. - How's tango, girls and health? - OK. How's tango, girls, health and family? No... I don't have a family. Sorry buddy. No, it's zero, your oversway! The oversway... in the velvet. When you break your neck, hello! 1 cm there... because I don't feel very well. Seems a bit tight to me. What is, perhaps, the shoulder pads, right? Normal, normal. - Can't remove them, right? - No no, it's fine. Maybe, reinforce, a little here, right? Must see. That's a bit wide, right? What do you think? 1cm maybe. Then maybe take 1 centimeter there, right? No because of the belt. It will be fine. - So I don't know, it's... - Widen a little yes. Well then... Everything's fine? It's okay my dear. Tonight, for your first competition, don't think about victory, and don't think about dancing Forget if you can, when you dance. Just be happy to dance... ...and you will overcome. Good luck children! Declaring the winner of the tango championship of the 20th arrondissement: Leon and Fumée! We wish them all a brilliant career! - Are we getting married tomorrow? - Change your job first. What's wrong with my job? What do you put in your passport? I don't have one, but if I had one, I would put: "bath boy shower, sauna." It's a job? No, it's not a job. And you, what's your job called? You want me to tell everyone? - Your job has names... - Can't you mute it a bit? Besides... It's not the job that counts... It's love. - It's love that matters. - Well then change your job. Bye! Loose woman, is that a happy job? More cheerful than sauna shower bath boy, and more profitable! We don't celebrate victory with champagne and everything? I have my Saturday date. Bye! Tango is good but it doesn't feed you. It looks like you signed up at the Île-de-France championships? - Well yes. - Me too. Look... I review. May the best win! Morning pastis: grief. Evening pastis: hope. Fumée, she's held back by a Chinese guy... - A Chinese guy? - Yes. She asked me to replace her. To replace her, uh... - ...for everything? - No, honey. Only for your rehearsal. I also know the tango. You're great. Curvy. I get chills... ...almost everywhere. Happy birthday Leon! Do we undress? Me? No. Neither will I. Well. - Shall we toss a coin for this? - Oh yes! - I take heads. - Then I've got tails. Tails... Well done! That brings luck. We'll see. Does it make you laugh? - Good evening darling. - Good evening. I'll leave it to you. Listen Leon. I thought about what George said. We haven't been dancing very well lately. If it continues like this, tomorrow will be a flop. I'm 33, it's my birthday today! It's your birthday today, and our party tomorrow. Bravo Leon! - Robert Pottier. - It's me. You should change your brilliantine. I'll tell you... A guy like you is like death: it shouldn't exist. Well my dear friends, now it's time for tango. And all the candidates participating in this grand final of the Ile-de-France Tango Championships will be kind enough to come to the dance floor now. To you candidates, for this Île-de-France championship. Now here are the results. The names of the winners of this great competition, those who will represent Île-de-France at the national tango championships: Leon and Fumée! Leon and Fumée winner ahead of Ramon and Rosita! - But, you are in mourning Mrs. Lamour? - You died for me Leon. - I died for you? - I see a corpse in your eyes! - A dead body? - The one of our love! Well, you're not very cheerful this morning! Oh no Leon! - Hello, Mrs. Lamour. - Hello Valentine. A sauna. Hello Mrs. Valentine. How was the Caribbean? You're late Leon! Was your trip beautiful? The sea, the boats... Mind your own business Leon! To work! Go! to work! You don't want to take your sauna? Not me. Who then? My daughter, who no longer has a father, who's coming. Who no longer has a father, and who's coming? She only has me... - And you, Leon. - Me? She's a virgin! Oh no... You're not going to take that back, Mrs Lamour. So, after me, it's "no" to my daughter too? Boldine, Leon. - Do you dance the tango? - No, why? - She's not dancing the tango. - She can learn. - Me too, by the way! - Especially not! Well then... I know you, but I don't recognize you... Do you have two minutes for me? - I've got all my life! - Right now? In two minutes... - Hey, you seem very busy! - Exactly. It's incredible, We never see you all alone any more. Shit! Mrs. Lamour, Fumée. Fumée, Boldine. Just to make you happy... Mrs. Lamour, your daughter... - Exceptional! - Thank you Leon! But it's you that I love. You think you have me like that? I don't know, I'm trying... Uh... Tonight, are you sleeping with me? Sleeping with a guy who's cheating on me? Are you dreaming? Am I dreaming? - Are you free tonight? - Not tonight I have my choir. - But tomorrow night. - Yes mom. There you are! They are, at least, they're simple! Farewell Leon. You lost your pants... I went bowling and that bitch of a ball got stuck. And my keys are in my right pocket, and my right hand can't fit in my right pocket. So I thought that by pulling my pants down, my left hand, this one, could fit in my right pocket! But I didn't have time since you arrived... What do you do for a living? I learn French. Then I saw you dancing the tango on the tv. To dance the tango like you, It really is my dream. I'll take the key? Well yes. - Shall I pull up your pants? - Well ok. It's easy if you're good at it. Don't worry, she's a whore. We'll meet again. You always come at the right time... You don't say that about your wife "she's a whore". Even if it's true. First of all, you're not my wife. It seems that you have taken out a subscription with Pierrette. I did not take out a subscription with Pierrette. I have reduced fare tickets. What do you have there? My ball. Do you ever let her go? - Fumée? I want to... - To do what? - Well to... - To dance? That's it, I want to dance. Well see you later, at Georges and Rosi's. Oh shit, the mirror. With that, Madame Rosy, my little final round for the day is finished. No, my little Leon! This ball does not exist. It's a dream you're having. Capricorn...or Taurus? Sign of water... sign of fire? So what? I'm waiting. Shall we go? - With her? - And then? My ball is making someone laugh? Because this one, I'd like to congratulate him. Because it's really funny. You're crazy! Excuse me Mr. George! Excuse me... I suddenly made a hit. Put a little more heart in your tango. The French championship is tomorrow Not in 6 months. And you? - Wouldn't that occur to you? - What, sweetie? I do not know... Change your job. - What? - Alright, I didn't say anything. And how would I make a living? Say... I will be your only client. Talk about a deal! I feel like I'm going to get angry... Live on love... and fresh water... Well no! Start. Leon... Are you happy? Leon... The curse, is it over? Yes it's over. - But... I'm still afraid. - Afraid of what? - My face. - What do you mean "my face"? But it's nothing? Well, my profile... Leon... You have the profile of Louis XIV. - Louis XIV? - Yes, Louis XIV of the tango. - Oh yeah? - Yes. Especially when I dance... when I dance the tango. - Nevertheless... - Eh? ...I'm scared. At school... I was always the first... next to the door. In case of fire... - I don't know if you follow me. - In the tango, right away. What if I was alone again? Heartache... My master... always told me: "Everything for the dance." "You have to dance". You have to dance. - You have to dream too. - You have to dream. Always. And for me, to be on a dance floor, and to dance again... and that it doesn't stop... never! Well... What's the matter? I don't believe in... tango anymore. You no longer believe... - I no longer believe... - What? What do you no longer believe? Love. Fumée? I no longer believe in anything. Nothing at all. You have no shame? - Hi Fumée! Hi Leon! - Hi. What are they doing there? They had been eliminated. They won in Corsica. - And how do you know? - I know it. Yes? I have something very important to tell you. Go ahead! After the championship I'm leaving with Ramon. I preferred to tell you. I don't care. Love stories and more... it has nothing to do with that. Nothing to do with what? With the dance. - Fumée, how did you meet her? - Well, as a customer. You know what it is... - Then after, you leave with her? - Yes... Venice, Singapore, Bangkok... Have a good trip. It was better to tell you, right? Not necessarily... We're friends, right? Yes, we are friends. And now, ladies and gentlemen, here is the French tango championship. What is dance? I don't know. Or rather... We must dance to know it. Who has not danced for one day, by the way? Who has not danced for one day, by the way?? Me, I have danced a long time. 60 years, I think. I have danced every day... That's beautiful. I'm sure that it's beautiful. It's beautiful... I'm sure that it's beautiful. And if I speak of dance, I think I also speak of love. And I'd like to tell you something... I don't know if I would know. I can teach you the steps, the figures... But the steps, the figures are nothing... Without love! Can I teach you love? I don't know. Farewell children! Or... if you still want to learn... I'm here. - So we're not getting married anymore? - Well no..... It doesn't matter, I'm going to marry someone else... - Would you like to? - Yes, I like to. - You see? - I like to but I have a boyfriend. I'm not a good match? Bath-shower-sauna boy. - So far it's paying off. - I like it too. Normal. I like it but I don't want to get married. What I want is... - Oh I know... That's it, it's for you! Too late. What? It's all over between us Leon. Poor guy! All that is not all that, but I am abandoned now! [I'm in a carafe] - What is it in a carafe? - Carafe is... it's shit. Shit? No. Come on Leon. Come on, come on. Leon, next year, you and me, we will be world tango champions. What are you doing? It's like that: oversway. Come on... come on, like this. The tango is dead? For her, a douche. After the night we just spent, eh, darling? Look Leon. Do you understand Leon? Come on, sit next to your buddy! - You're not my friend anymore... - Come here. I won't eat you, shit! Fumée is a romantic, you know that. Fumée is a bitch! - Is that how you talk about women? - That's how it is... Well with me romantic girls don't last more than eight days. That's the rule. I can't do anything about it. So why did you steal her from me? 'Cause I knew you were gonna win, jerk! I'll never be first, unless the first is missing or tired. I knew I was going to lose. Understand? I didn't want to be alone in defeat, understand? Soy una merda! A real shit! You have something there! - Where? - There, but it must be exploited. The tango... The tango is over. Fumée pisses me off... You piss me off... I'm bored... "The tango is over. I'm bored." You're not a little crazy, are you? Fumée and you can do a lot of money! I will be your manager! Tricks, it's in my blood! How do you think I won in Corsica? That's beautiful! Fumée okay. No more love... Money! - No more love? - No Leon, money! I'll take you to England! In America! You speak English? - No, I don't speak English... - Say "tango". Don't be silly! It'll go like this... We'll make crazy money! We won't make any money at all, I don't dance anymore... But why, poor jerk! - You don't understand? - Oh no! When Valentine returns, you tell her to look for another stooge! You're crazy Leon! Fumée... Nothing at all! Think again Leon! Money Leon! Soy una merda! A real shit! And Fumée loves you! A guy who dances like you, he will never be alone. Think about that. Sweet, sweet Leon... Sweet? What is that "sweet"? "Sweet"... it means "soft", in English. Soft? In English? "A freebie, but you have to seduce me..." Remember? "You're great.... curvy." "I get chills almost everywhere..." "It does things to me, that I really can't say..." "Your eyes are beautiful... And your skin then, it must be something." "Isn't my spiel beautiful?" "Yes, but that's not what makes me melt..." - "What is it then?" - "I don't know..." "What I like is people who have something special ...something of their own." "I've got nothing..." "Oh yes! I've got that!" Leon and Fumée, European champions.
