Lost his memory. A shell-shocked soldier... Outpost No. 2 Tuesdays are special days at the railway station. An express train passes through.

I am looking for Mr. Fabcom... How did you find me? At your service, Mr. Fabcom. Well, tell me... Typhus We were retreating... We'll get you into the trade union... We'll get you a job. Much obliged, Mr. Fabcom... Forgive me, master. Don't you know how we drove out the masters? How we fought for the revolution? Brothers!!! Me too... I was at war too! Great! If only we had birch branches to lash each other. I have found his wife... But not a word to him... Non-commissioned officer Filimonov becomes a worker again. That's the Labour Security Commission. Security?! PRAVDA It's time to put a protective rail at last... Complaining? In front of the director?! They'll throw you out!!! Getting accustomed? Yes ma'am! I don't understand anything...

Stage props. Do not touch. Stage props. Do not touch. The master!!! You? You... are the master? You are a bastard!!! The master. Socialist competition is not the same as rivalry. If one of the competing groups lags behind... the duty of the other... is not to celebrate its victory, but... as a regular part of the same competition... to help the low-performing ones... to give them a lift, because then... the entirety of socialist construction benefits.
