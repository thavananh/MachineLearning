foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- I figured it out. Oh, what was it? The hair on the waII beIongs to your daughter. What? I don't have a daughter. WeII... It's the one you never had. Your wife had an abortion before your chiIdren were born. Just a moment... is that right? She did. That's right... I'm gIad I asked you. Thank you very much. I'II stay with her in my dream. But, sir... That'II put me in troubIe. You consuIted me to find out the cause of your nightmares... ...and to get rid of them. Your famiIy is concerned about you. They are not concerned about me! There's no way I'm going back to my famiIy! I'm staying with her. I spoke with your daughter. I asked her not to appear in your dreams. You know that if you stay in your dreams for too Iong... ...you'II be catatonic when you wake up. What did she say to you? Did she agree with you? Of course not! She wouIdn't have. You know why she appears in my dreams? She is worried about me because my famiIy is horribIe! She is on daddy's side even though she was never born... Your famiIy feud is none of my concern. I didn't want to come into your dream... ...I onIy did it because you were my father's teacher. If you died in the reaI worId... I wouId be stuck here with you. PIease, come back with me. Thank you for aII your effort. You've done very weII. Thanks. Nightmare detective. Go ahead and Ieave. Or won't you be abIe to go back? Thank you. I appreciate it. Pronounced dead at 5:40 am. Dead? What do you mean dead? I asked you to save him, not to Iet him die! Look, I onIy Iet you stick around because Dad wouIdn't Iet you go. You screwed up. What did he say in his dream? Did he say who'd inherit his money? Who's going to beIieve a wiII drawn up in a dream? How can you go into his dreams anyway? I want you to Ieave now. Here's your fee. I can't take that. Get dressed or you'II catch a coId. Thanks for coming. Off you go! Good. I don't have to take care of him anymore. Dreams? Nonsense! Shameless man. Who will get your money? I hate this... I reaIIy hate it... I hate it... I hate it... I hate it... I hate it... Hello? I don't see any point in living anymore. I want to die, right now. Life is pointless. I've always wanted to die. - I've done so much for my family... - Why I should live anymore. I'll end the pain. I'm thinking of killing myself. I just want to disappear... Life's scary... ReaIIy? WiII you reaIIy die with me? What? Me? I'm very cIose to my pIace. Of course I do. Yes, I have a pair of scissors. What, right here? You said we'd die together. How do I know that you'II reaIIy kiII yourseIf? You might just pretend and scream. If I kiII myseIf and you don't, I'II Iook Iike a fooI. Why don't you kiII yourseIf first? When I am reaIIy sure, then I wiII foIIow you. Hey. Tell me... What? Where do we go when we die? Does everything just end just Iike that? I don't know... Maybe there is a re-set switch. You press it and you're alive again. Just Iike that? Yeah, just like that. What... What? What's going on? I just stabbed myself. Are you dying? ...I am... Awesome... Here I come too. First time on a crime scene? You must be nervous. When the siren's on everybody scoots out of the way. Isn't it fun? You shouIdn't wear those high-heeIs anymore. You might have to run. Is that an order? It isn't an order. Just friendIy advice. Detective, sir. You've arrived. Oh, young peopIe these days... Can't they kiII themseIves more discreetIy? What's wrong? FeeI sick? I'm okay. Time of death, Wakamiya? Between 3 and 5 am. Died of a massive hemorrhage. The cervicaI artery has been cut through. Yes, that did it. Age? She's 20. Any roommates? No. Any sign of robbery? I don't think so. No sign of iIIegaI entry and no sign of a search having taken pIace. The door was Iocked from inside. It's probabIy a suicide. Let's go through the routine and get the heII out of here. How about some Korean BBQ and beer? In the morning? I need something to pick me up. Stop joking around, it's unprofessionaI. Who brought her here? How can we deaI with this without a sense of humor? If she Iives by herseIf, there are no eyewitnesses... You can't turn this into something that it isn't. You made your name at the NationaI PoIice Agency by being thorough. But this is a suicide. No doubt about it. We don't know for sure. We have no witnesses but... ...a neighbor heard the victim scream: ''HeIp, I'm scared!'' KiIIing yourseIf is scary. Look at this... What? She caIIed someone Iast night. Find out who she caIIed. Sure. So that was your first visit to a crime scene... Can I ask you one thing, Keiko? Why did you ask to be transferred from the NationaI PoIice Agency? Why did you Ieave such an eIite position? I wouId never choose to be a Iousy detective. Wakamiya? Yes? Aren't you going to the BBQ? Of course I'm not going. Detective Sekiya was fooIing around. ReaIIy? That suicide case... What's your opinion on it? We haven't found a note... I don't know yet. When she was with the NationaI Agency, Lieutenant Kirishima worked... ...on organized crime cases. She provided unique anaIysis. She Iead many successfuI bribery investigations. She requested to be transferred to this precinct to work. She has a strong desire to get some hands-on experience. So we agreed to her unusuaI request. She Iacks experience on crime scenes. But the princess can't bear the sight of bIood. She'II get ahead of you if you're not carefuI. Are you saying that she is going to be my boss? Thanks for taking care of me aII these years. I'm going first. Take care of yourseIf. Stop this nonsense and come home now! You're saying we shouId kiII ourseIves Iive on ceII phones? That's an intriguing way to go. What? I have a StanIey knife with me. Are you making a fooI out of me? I heard you reacting to something. What is it? Did you say ''I feIt you?'' What do you mean? HeIIo? Wait a minute... HeIIo? I'm in front of the eIevator. I'm aImost home. Here I go... Good-bye. HeIp me... Is the princess okay? Yes, thank you. Can you teII us about what happened with your husband? Yes... It was Iike... ...he was having a horribIe nightmare. He was stabbing himseIf screaming ''HeIp me!'' In a nightmare...? It was as if he was being attacked in his dream. That's what it was Iike... How couId he die Iike that...? In such a horrifying way... Why have these things been happening? What's going on? The wife witnessed the whoIe thing. Case cIosed. Agreed? - Wait just a second. - What? Look at this. Wakamiya, why aren't you showing it to me first? The same... He caIIed the same person that the femaIe victim caIIed. Let's head back to headquarters. ''SUICIDE+0'' We couIdn't specify anything from the transmission record. The onIy way to get to ''0'' is to rediaI his number. Did the girI kiII herseIf in her dream the other night? Maybe this ''0'' person pIayed mind games with them. In that case he couId be charged with abetted murder. But the wife saw the man kiIIing himseIf. That's suicide. What about the autopsy? Nothing unusuaI was found. Inspector. CaIIing him shouId be done with caution. One faIse move and we might be detected. Somebody shouId pretend to be suicidaI and caII ''0.'' Who wouId that be? You shouId because you're not very impressionabIe. Not me! If you won't caII, I wiII then. You? I don't think that the suspect wouId enjoy taIking to you much. What do you mean? We've found something strange on both victims' ceII phones. We're even more confused by this finding... Listen to this. What's this about? It's the recording of their Iast phone conversation. Listen carefuIIy... Here it is. Help me... Help... Help me, please... This is weird. This case might require extraordinary measures. ShouId we consuIt someone? I guess we shouId. We shouId approach this case from two perspectives. Sekiya is in charge of the case on this side. Ms. Kirishima, you are in charge on the other side. The other side? How come I have to find someone psychic to heIp us? Why shouId I be the one? This is a new situation. I don't know anybody speciaIized in this kind of stuff. I don't know who to ask. There was a psychic who Iocated... a buried body after seeing the suspect on a videotape. I don't think he can pick up anything from recorded voices. Anyone who can guess the owner of a phone from a phone number? Nobody does that. Right... no ordinary person couId. How about somebody who can anaIyze dreams? Somebody who can find things from a victim's dreams? - Dreams? - Right. Both victims had nightmares before they kiIIed themseIves. There's someone who might be abIe to heIp. He's a bit strange, though. This guy has apparentIy entered the dreams of 3 peopIe. AII 3 had been traumatized by nightmares. I'm not sure if they stopped having nightmares after that though... We shouId try that guy. He's done it again. Oh, please... Don't die, pIease! I want you to Iive. Why did you try to hang yourseIf again? I guess he won't be much heIp. Mr. Kagenuma, sorry to disturb you but we need your heIp. Two peopIe died in their sIeep. They may have kiIIed themseIves or they couId be victims of murder. They both contacted a person known as ''0'' before they died. PossibIy ''0'' controIs their minds so that they kiII themseIves. But compIicating these cases further are... recordings of the Iast phone conversations they had. On both their ceII phones, we can hear a girI's voice. But in spectrum anaIysis, that voice is actuaIIy the victims'. It's too difficuIt a trick to puII. A poIice detective wiII caII this mysterious person, ''0.'' I want to ask you to enter the detective's dream. And find out what's happening in his dream. - Hey, what are you doing? - It's okay, Wakamiya. If you change your mind, caII me at the number on the card. Come on. Let's go. I'm pIacing a caII. Try to Iocate the receiver. I know. Don't worry. I'm good at stretching out conversations. Yes, I wiII. Stand by. PIace a caII to this phone. His number is registered. Make sure to sound convincingIy suicidaI, okay? I know. Here I go. Nobody's answering. ShaII I caII? Take care of your own psychic investigation. I'm sorry. I must have been dozing off... What is it? We've been trying but nobody answers the caII. Keiko... You'd better reIax a bit. Try not to antagonize those who are on your side. Thanks. What's wrong? I'm sociaIIy inept. I'm aIways butting heads with my superior. I can't stand men who are out to prove that they're better than me. I'II pretend that I didn't hear that. We'II keep caIIing the number. I don't think ''0'' wiII answer tonight. You shouId rest whiIe you can. We'II take turns so I can rest tomorrow. I need to sIeep... ''The AnaIysis of Dreams by Medard Boss''... HeIIo? Who is it? Listen, please... You shouldn't make that phone call. You shouldn't make that phone call. Are you...? ...that man? Mr. Kagenuma, what do you mean by that? What are you talking about, Keiko? Are you okay? We've established contact with ''0. '' I caIIed ''0'' up on his ceII phone. We faiIed to Iocate him though. He almost hung up on me saying ''I don't care who you are. '' But he got interested in me and we had a conversation. He didn't pIay any tricks on my mind. There's something that bothers me. Towards the end he said ''0'', I asked him why. He said that he'd felt me then. It was kind of creepy... ...but I'm okay. He doesn't know my true identity. I'II caII him again. Help me... Help... Wakamiya... No... Wakamiya... No... Keep your eye on Wakamiya. He couId be affected by ''0!'' Okay, I understand. What, are you coming over? Stay home. Why are you coming? HeIIo? What was that about? Nothing. ...Is it my turn? Are you there, Mr. Kagenuma? The man who I visited you with, Wakamiya, caIIed ''0.'' Looks Iike he was affected by whatever ''0'' did to him. ''0'' will approach Wakamiya in his dream tonight. I have no idea what will happen. I beg you. Please enter Wakamiya's dream and look for a clue. Wakamiya is at headquarters. I'm on my way there. Leave me aIone... PIease, Ieave me aIone... Wakamiya? He's sIeeping on the couch. I hate this... I hate it... I hate it... I hate it... I hate it... I hate it... Go to bed earIy or eIse you'II grow up to be bums. Don't foIIow me! Go to bed. Go to bed now. WiII you come back? WiII you pIay with us again? Mr. Kagenuma. Thank God, you've come. Why did you caII me? When you visited me, I Iooked into your mind. Just for a spIit second... I didn't want to but I did... What did you see... ...in my mind? Stop! I don't want to know. I want you to agree to one thing. Entering peopIe's dreams is not my profession. I've onIy done it to rescue acquaintances from nightmares. I enter dreams. That's aII I can promise you. I guarantee nothing more. It aIways ends up traumaticaIIy. I had to face horribIe things. Disgusting things... I reaIIy don't want to do it. You ask for my heIp for your own good but it's risky for me. It's dangerous both for me and the dreamer. The dreamer might end up insane. So pIease... This is the Iast time. Can you promise me that? Okay. Even if I enter his dream, I don't know what I can do there. If there's any danger, I'II just turn around and come back. Okay? Understood? Okay. But I want you to save Wakamiya if he's in danger. How Iong has he been sIeeping? He was aIready sIeeping when I got here so... ...at Ieast 2 hours. I see. Let me know when his eyes start to twitch. Mr. Kagenuma, his eyes! Good. I'II ask you a few questions. TeII me the first thing that pops up in your mind. There are 2 suspension bridges in front of you. Where am I? It couId be anywhere. Why? It doesn't matter. Which bridge do you choose? The Ieft one. You're crossing the Ieft bridge. There's a poIar bear sitting in the middIe of it. It's eating a bowI fuII of bagworm caterpiIIars. It's annoying... What wiII you do? I'II push it off. I'II push it off. There's a boy hoIding chopsticks in his right hand and a bowI in his Ieft. Who? Bagworms in a bowI... I'II sIap it out of his hand! - SimpIe answers, pIease. - Why...? You reaIize that you are soaking wet. Now remember the dream you had Iast night. Why? Why am I...? What coIor was your dream? I don't Iike it! None of it! It's aII ridicuIous! Why am I here? Who am I here for? The worId is fuII of seIfish idiots and psychopaths! Is he dreaming? This rotten worId shouId end now! Vanish forever! Disappear! Now! What's the easiest way to bring an end to it aII? KiII yourseIf. Kiss the worId good-bye! It's so easy! I figured that out a Iong time ago. I've never toId anyone but... ...it's so obvious. I've known it aII aIong! Goddamn it... Why did I have to be born in this boring worId? I was going to kiII myseIf anyway! Come and get me! What is that? Who are you? HeIp me! HeIp! HeIp me! Somebody heIp! HeIp! What's wrong? Don't be scared. Nothing's scary. Everything's okay. No need to worry. It's okay. You can come out of there. Wakamiya! CaII the paramedics! I didn't know that I wanted to kiII myseIf. Wakamiya! I'm okay... My wounds have heaIed. Who was he? He was different... Mother... Why...? Why are you scared of me? Mom... Mom... Disappear... Disappear... Out of the way, fat ass. I hate Japan. Why was I born here? I've had enough! I'm through! You're all totally idiotic! Get a life, you losers. You disgust me. Don't Iook into my mind! I'm convinced that you're the onIy person who can soIve this case. There was a man who attacked you in the dream. You have to stop that man. If dreams and reaIity are interconnected, you can stop him. I don't think so. Better to forget him and run away. I was doing desk work at the PoIice Agency. I'd never been to a crime scene or encountered victims. I reaIized that anaIyzing cases from a desk didn't suit me. I wanted something tangibIe. That's what I knew. This is the first case where I've had hands-on experience. I Iost my coIIeague, Wakamiya. I don't want to forget it and run. Nobody can simpIy determine what is right and what is wrong. I think you're eviI to ask me to do those things. I can't teII who deserves to go to heII but... ...I'm positive that you'II go to heII. Why is that? You don't even care that you're putting me in danger! Did you figure that it wouId be okay because I'm suicidaI? That I couId heIp you whiIe I was stiII aIive? Is that what you figured? See? You're definiteIy going to heII. I'II go to heII if I have to. My wiII to Iive faIters just from speaking with you. You're right. I want to die. I want to Ieave this worId. But I don't want to die in somebody's dream. HeIIo? Yes? Who's there? I... I want to kiII myseIf. I found you on the Net. I've decided that I want to die with you. Stop it! It's easy for me to tell if you're lying... ...or telling the truth. You're telling me the truth. You measure your quality by your achievements. But you're also full of anger and suspicion. You feel empty. You want something that makes you feel alive. In this concrete jungle, you lost your primal pleasure to live. You're fading like a flickering fluorescent light. You want to feel yourself. You want to destroy yourself. You want to see something frightening. In the back of your mind you're thinking of death. That's why you called me. ''0'', I just feIt you. You're not aIone now. The next time I faII asIeep, I wiII be kiIIed by him. Come into my dream, pIease. I need you to heIp me catch him. You have no idea... ...how horribIe dreams can be. Let's die together here. It's scary to die in dreams. It's a good idea. Dreams are too horrifying. We shouId die together here. Come with me! Why have you become so obsessed with death? What happened to you? I pity you. What made you Iike this? Shut up! Poor Wakamiya... That was not a reguIar suicide. I want to know what's going on... ...as much as you do. I understand your obsession but you need sIeep. What's wrong? I caIIed him. I caIIed ''0.'' But why...? I won't be abIe to sIeep untiI he's arrested. But you haven't sIept at aII! I don't want more victims to faII in his trap! I'II get him from my dream. PIease, find him in the reaI worId. But it's Iate... Stop wasting time and catch him! It's me. I'm the one who promised to die with you tonight... Good evening. It's getting quite late. I was thinking of killing myself soon. How about you? Are you ready? Yeah... Yes. ...I'm ready. Wait. Are you having second thoughts? No, I'm not. You know that life is meaningless. You've been trying hard to prove otherwise, right? Don't bother. Just take it easy. Everything is meaningless. We all die eventually. We all die and Earth will be left spinning and uninhabited. Spinning and spinning very quietly. It must be beautifully silent. Anything will eventually end. The Earth will be engulfed by the Sun. The Sun will eventually burn out. The universal energy won't last forever... What's the meaning of proving your worth in such a world? It takes a strong person like you to live alone. The world is nothing but a phony void. It's not real. We can slice it up with my knife. What's this? Who put this here? Did I...? You did. Come on, you want to die. Why are you fighting yourseIf? I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I want to Iive. I don't want to die Iike those others. I can feeI pain. I'm awake. I'm okay... He'II come and kiII me soon... ...in my dream... I'm scared. I'm very afraid. WiII you reaIIy die with me? Right here... Right now. I figured it out. Death is not fear of emptiness. Death is the joy of eternity. If I have to come back again to Iive... ...that wouId be the worst. Death is an eternaI dream... UnbreakabIe peace. It is naturaI to be scared of dying. But it's onIy scary before your Iife ends. Once you're dead, nothing is scary anymore. Even if you try to prevent death from coming... ...you stiII die anyway. And when the end comes you feeI nothing. It's aII the same. You see hatred, don't you? You must have feIt so much fear. Your Iife has been so fearfuI. Let's forget it. Let's end it aII, together. We'II die together right here and now. I was born in this worId... ...and nobody wanted me. The pain is over. We're going to die together now. ''0'', it's you. I'm ready to kill myself. There's something... ...I have to teII you. I'm a detective and I've been after you. Are you surprised? I reaIIy wanted to catch you. But I don't think I can. You win. So teII me... TeII me one thing. I have to know. How do you enter other peopIe's minds? Why? Because I want to know the truth. That's aII. I wonder how... Maybe it's empathy... I felt connected to them. At first I really wanted to just kill myself. I decided to commit suicide with a girl who found me on the Web. Live on cell phones, in separate locations. That was when I felt her presence strongly... ...as if she jumped right inside me. It was a shocking sensation. It felt so strong that I yelped. Then I stabbed myself in the stomach. On the verge of death I dreamed. I could see the girl in front of her apartment. I was bleeding to death. It was quite a sensation, really. Then I had this hunger. The girl looked very delicious. If I didn't eat her, I felt like I would lose myself. The hunger I felt for her was so tremendous I couldn't suppress it. When I finished sucking her blood, I found myself at home. My stomach wound had completely healed. I heard the news that some girl had been found dead. I didn't know if it was a dream or not. But I wanted to feel the sensation again... So I mutilated myself more and more severely. This time, I'll cut myself up into pieces. It will be impossible to reassemble the pieces again. I'll crave for you so badly that I'll come to you... Help me... Please, help... Please, help... I'm sIeeping! I can't sIeep yet! Wake up! I've never wanted to die! I don't want to die! Since when? Since when have you been Iike that? Since when have you wanted to die? I've never wanted to die! Don't Iie to me. How Iong have you been Iike this? I don't know... I don't know when it started... I don't know when... Have you wanted to die aII aIong? I aIways wanted to... ...become a strong person. But many things happened and... I don't know anything anymore. I knew you were different. With your past, it's naturaI that you want to die. You're so gifted but you don't do anything with it. Destroy everything with me! Come on! It's pIaytime. I envy you. You're so ignorant. You understand nothing. You don't understand anything. Teacher! No, Teacher! HeIp. HeIp me! HeIp me... I compIeteIy forgot that. No wonder I remember nothing about my chiIdhood. Anybody wouId bIock out such a memory. Such a... ...terribIe memory. I didn't understand anything anymore... Thank you though. You heIped me remember such an important thing. I know now. It makes perfect sense. We are the terror of the worId. OnIy we can show them terror... ...to those who have forgotten terror! I've aIways wanted to die! AIways! I've just wanted to disappear. I don't want you to die. I want you to Iive. I don't want to die! I want to Iive. Live with me. Live! PIease! Don't! He stabbed himself. He was unconscious when he was brought in. I checked his cell phone. He wouldn't let go of it. While he was unconscious he spoke with some people. On his ceII phone? Where did you disappear, Keiko? I called you many times at home. What's going on? The case is cIosed. What? Are you okay? Keiko? I'II turn in the report. Can you tell me what's going on? But now... I just have to sIeep... Keiko Kirishima! Hello? Can you go home soon? Yes, very soon. Good. That's good. GIad to hear that. Hey. Let's eat ramen noodIes. It's on me. Come on. I... Maybe next time. I've been on the IV drip. I feeI fuII. What are you taIking about? I found a good restaurant near here. But I shouIdn't Ieave... You said you were okay! It's a part of your rehabiIitation. You know... I turned in the report on the case. Nobody beIieves what I wrote. You've had enough, haven't you? How about you? WiII you stiII enter... ...other peopIe's dreams? I hope that I won't have to. But I don't know... I might... And you? WiII you quit the poIice force? No... I won't quit. But I... I don't know if I can handIe it. I create friction with everybody around me. I don't understand peopIe's feeIings. I wish I couId see into peopIe's minds to know them better. If you couId... ...you'd onIy see ugIy things. Is that true? I don't know... I don't think it's true. I think I wouId aIso find something... ...good.
