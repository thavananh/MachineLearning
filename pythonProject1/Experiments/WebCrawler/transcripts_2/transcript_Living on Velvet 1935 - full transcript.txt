foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Are we going to be late for the dance, Terry? Don't worry, Sis'. The 'Parker Express' will get to Newport alright. It's getting pretty thick, isn't it, son? Not so bad. Is anything wrong, Terry? - Not a thing, mother. Out of gas, son? - Pretty low, Dad. I've got to find a hole quick. What's the matter, Terry? - Nothing, mother. I'm just trying to shake this fog. [ Announcement ] "Nine pursuit planes are to take off in an echelon 'V' formation." "Captain Ramsay will lead." Who in the blazes is that? Watch out for this crate coming under. We can't understand what's going on. This plane that came from nowhere, is raising havoc with the 'V' formation. Follow me. He's disrupting the entire formation .. what a mess. Land by section. Now he's waving the plane to the ground. Either he's a practical joker, or he's just insane. Captain .. bring that man to me. The Major would like to have a talk with you. Here he is, sir. What's your name? - Terence C. Parker. What the devil were you doing out there? - The 'C' stands for Clarence. I was doing a bit of flying up there. Oh, you were. You deliberately made a mess of our manoeuvres. You need a good explanation and be quick about it. I'm afraid if I'm quick about it it won't be a good explanation. But with a few minutes talk I'm sure I can give you a Jim-Dandy. What did you say your name was? Still, Terence C. Parker. The 'C' stands for Clarence. Didn't you fly the airmail a few years back? Ah .. Major .. this is the Terry Parker who flew the New York/Chicago route. You remember when for no reason he flew the mail to Montreal instead of Chicago. For no reason at all? Oh no, that's not fair. Have you any idea of the monotony of flying between New York and Chicago .. And Chicago/New York night after night? I see .. and I suppose you thought our manoeuvres were monotonous? You're right, Captain. There's nothing more monotonous than a 'V' formation. Hold this man in custody. - Now just a minute, please. Have I violated a law or an ordinance? I'm a licensed pilot .. I flew the prescribed distance above the ground. There are no speed laws in the air, and I'm a citizen. You violated the .. You broke the .. Captain, there's a perfectly good reason to hold this man. What is it? Sorry, Major. See, some good may result from this episode. We all realize the need of laws for the air. I suggest we all write our Congressman immediately. Gibraltar. - Hello Terry. Lawton told me you showed up this morning lugging baggage. Then I discovered that my plane was missing. When I heard on the radio that some lunatic had joined the Army manoeuvres. Well, I just put two and two together and got 'Terry'. Ah, the old mathematical genius. Me, I never could add. You meant to say that it was your plane he was using? I'm Walter Pritcham .. a very good friend of General Schwartz. I'll take charge of Parker and see that he behaves. I assure you we want no part of him. Shall I warm up the plane? No thanks. We're going back by car and I am driving. If you wait a bit, I'll steal two bicycles. It's safer. Come on. Or a wheelbarrow made for two. No danger at all if you push gently. Bye Major, bye Captain, bye Lieutenant. Bye, Private. I see .. all in all, a fine eighteen months. A trip to Alaska .. thoroughly aimless. Four months in China. Ten days in jail for disturbing the peace in Venezuela. Two plane smash-ups, two broken ribs, one lawsuit. And now an uninvited participant in the Air Corps manoeuvres. That sums it up nicely. - And money. You had fifty thousand in the bank a year and a half ago. I'll bet you haven't got ten thousand left. The exact amount hovers around five hundred. Five hundred? What have you got to show for it? - Cancelled cheques. And when the five hundred is gone, then what? Well .. No man living on velvet .. What he does, or how much he spends .. really doesn't matter. Oh, it's that thing again. I know, Terry. But that was two years ago. I suffered three scratches and a headache. But Dad .. mother .. Cynthia .. Fini. I really shouldn't have lived. The three dearest people in the world were dead. I have no right to take advantage of a miracle. So you see, Gibraltar, I .. I really died with them. At that moment. Every minute since then. Every minute from now on is Pure Velvet. Of course I appreciate your feeling. Everybody does. But after all .. Is all this aimless shifting about the world necessary? And this mania for mad flying. What on earth makes you do it? - I don't know. It's something .. Up there. Something that tried to get me once. And didn't. I'm giving it another chance, that's all. That's sportsmanship. - That's bosh. We've a lot of respect for each other, the heavens and I. We've even grown sort of friendly. Lawton, phone Curtis Field and have them keep my plane in a hangar overnight. Yes, sir. Have you any idea why I'm shaving? - You're going to a party. Oh. Who's party? - Amy Prentiss's party. Who is Amy Prentiss? - The girl I might marry. Well, in that case I'll have to give myself a good shave. What's she like? - About 45. Weighs a little over 200. Her eyes are blue. The good one, that is. Complexion, spotty. She's .. I'm sure she's divine. - The exact word. Surprised? - No. Oh, congratulations. - Thanks. Oh, shaving is a nuisance. I'm through. You mean you're going with only one side of your face shaved? Why, certainly. Why not? Turn around. I'll finish it. - A fine thing. Do you want to hear the truth about Amy? - No. She's lovely, charming, gracious. Intelligent. A typical barber. Now, less conversation and more shaving. - Enchanting. Cultured .. magnetic. Briefly, you love her. - Briefly, I do. She loves you? - Oh, about half as much. But that's enough for me. Now, let me finish telling you about her. She's .. she's fascinating. Breathtaking. Give me that. I'll not let any man in the throws of puppy love shave me. That's your own business. Good evening, Andrews. - How do you, sir. Silly to bring you, after tonight's headlines. There isn't a respectable person that will say hello to you. That's a bet. How do you do, Mr Pritcham? - Hello. How do you do? She said 'how do you do'. She looked pretty respectable to me. Yes, but .. she doesn't read the papers. A very handsome collection of stuffed shirts. All I can say is, Amy's aunt's friends are my friends. It has been so dull here this year. - Hello. Evening. How are you? Why, she's notorious .. - Hello, girls. Hello, Eddie. - Hello, Walter. I saw the most extraordinary gown. You've never seen anything like .. Who is he? Aha .. nice girls. Once around the room and only snubbed twice. This is no time for crowing. Here comes aunt Martha, the acid test. How are you, Walter? - Good evening, aunt Martha. May I present Mr Parker. Mrs Prentiss. Amy's aunt. - How do you do, Mr Parker? Amy is somewhere about. She .. Parker? Park ..? Of the Philadelphia Parkers, aunt Martha. His mother was Peggy Lawrence. I've never been in an aeroplane in my life. We're looking for Amy, aunt Martha. You'll excuse us, won't you. Of course. I'm not built for this kind of work. You carry on. Alright, you stay here. I'll find Amy in a jiffy. May I help you, Madame? - Please. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Nice night, isn't it? - Splendid. Having a nice time? - Fine, fine. I'm so glad. - Warm for this time of year though. It's unusually warm. It seems the weather in New York gets hotter all the time. I read an interesting article the other day. It seems the gulf stream comes closer and closer to the city all the time. And it gets hotter and hotter all the time now. I'm willing to agree we can blame it all on the gulf stream. But it's spring. And we should have some rain. But where is it? It's inconvenient at times .. but it makes the heat .. Because it seems to me that .. I say, are you listening? - Oh yes. The gulf stream. Of course, there's many wiseacres .. I love raining. Don't you? Yes, I'm very fond of rain. Why don't you tell me the gulf stream was responsible for the Frisco quake? Last year, it was Central Asia. Stella Wright said down there, it rains 20 out of 24 hours every day. It's getting on her nerves. I always say to them 'if you knew the first thing about science' .. 'You'd know what caused the war'. Virginia is a lovely place. - And speaking of cold spells .. We're not having the winters we used to have. I remember back in 1904, along about March .. There's Henry. Excuse me, dear. Do you think New York will ever be like California? Oh, it's nice seeing you. We'll have to get together again sometime. Could you direct me to some food? I'm hungry. A sandwich? No thanks. A nice party. - Yes. Very. Isn't it? - Yes. A sandwich? No thanks. You? Dance? Beautiful, isn't it? - Yes, very. It's a lovely bridge, really. I'd like to say something. Something .. - I know. It isn't necessary. Do you like travelling? Yes, that's right. Let's get out of here. Let's get some fresh air. I can't .. well, I shouldn't. Why? The party has just begun. Oh, but that's the ideal time to leave any party. At the beginning. Alright .. I'll get my coat. - I'll meet you at the elevator. Alright. Shall we go? [ Door knocks ] Did you ring, Miss Prentiss? - Yes, Travis. If my aunt or Mr Pritcham ask where I am. Say I have stepped out for a moment with Mr Parker. Mr Terry Parker. Yes, Miss. - Thank you. But do you realize there are a lot of wiseacres .. Who have convulsions if you mention the Gulf Stream to them. I admit the influence of the Gulf Stream. But I can't agree with you that it causes the rain in Central America. My friend Stella who lives there, writes me it rains 20 hours out of 24 each day. Yes, that's the gulf stream. I like the sound of your voice. I want to hear more of it. Won't you say something nice and long? 30 days hath September, Apwil, June .. - What? 30 days hath September, Apwil, June .. - Apwil? Apwil? Hmm .. I see. Repeat after me, please. Around the rugged rocks, the ragged, rascals ran. Awound the wugged wocks, the wagged wascals ran. There, you see. Now, you know everything. Yes .. continue please. 30 days hath September. April .. June and November. All the rest have 31 except February which alone has .. 28 and one day more we add to every four. Can't we do something nice tomorrow? Nice? Couldn't we hire a couple of chairs and sit in them .. so I can look at you? Would that be good? A lovely morning. No .. looks like rain. My toes ache. It says there: 'Fair and warmer'. Well .. in that case we'll have to resort to the Indian prayer for rain. The ritual was entrusted to me by an old Indian Chief. Whom I befriended as he lay dying in the Black Hills of South Dakota. That's a rattlesnake. But to make this really effective, I'll need another rattlesnake. Do you mind being a rattlesnake? Come on. That will do. It will rain shortly. I love rain. - Then I can look at you tomorrow? Well alright, if you don't look too hard or too long. You mean like this? No, that's bad. That says bad things. Is this bad? Now, you see .. that's sweet. Allow me to present an old friend of mine. General Sherman. Anybody that's good enough for Terry Parker is good enough for me. Do you know who I am? - Of course. I knew the very first moment I saw you. Well .. I don't believe I caught the name. Amy. Of course, you are Amy. You would have to be, wouldn't you. You're Gibraltar's Amy. Just .. Amy. For every light on Fifth Avenue .. For every leaf in Central Park, there is a girl in New York. Millions of lights, millions of leaves, millions of girls. But you are Gibraltar's Amy. But I'm not. I don't belong to anyone. I'm .. I'm just Amy, that's all. - You're engaged, aren't you? He loves you. - Not too much. And you love him. - Not enough. Yes you do. You have to. You hear that, Gibraltar's Amy? It's alright, Officer. I mean, it's all wrong. You don't have to worry anyway. I'll take the lady home. Listen to me, Terry. Well? Have a nice time? - So-so. The party slumped after you left. - It wasn't very nice of us to go. Quite alright. I was a one-man stag line. Poor darling. Hold that pose. A charming couple. Goodnight. - Wait a minute. Where are you going? - I don't know. Any suggestions? - Aren't you coming home with me? No. Goodnight, Gibraltar. Goodnight, Amy. Are you going to have any dinner, Amy? - No, thank you. But you didn't have any luncheon. - Didn't I? And Travis says you didn't eat your breakfast. That takes care of the whole day. Doesn't it, aunt Martha? You've spent the entire day at that window. I like rain. What's wrong with the Police? - They're trying, Amy. I've even talked to the Commissioner. I guess he's .. gone off somewhere. But his things are at your place, aren't they? That won't stop Terry. You've got to find him, Walter. Do you understand? You've got to. I understand. Why .. I'm sorry, Walter. - I'm not. You're happy and that's all that matters. You know .. you're the grandest sort of person. I guess there must be something terribly wrong with me because .. I do like you so much. Really, so much. But .. You'll find him for me, won't you? Won't you? - I'll find him. I'll fight anyone in the house. I said I'll fight anyone in the house. Now listen, pal. I don't want any more trouble out here. So, turn around and beat it. The name is John L Sullivan and I can lick anyone in the place. What's the matter? Isn't there an Irishman in the place? - Casey. Run down to the corner and tell the Cop I want to see him. Oh .. a Cop, huh? My meat. Hello, Mr Pritcham. Say, we got this fellow Parker down here. No, he won't give his name. But the initials T.P. are in his hat. In your hat, you brass-buttoned gorilla. - Shut up! Okay, Mr Pritcham. I'm telling you again that T.P. stands for 'Third Prize'. I won that hat at a spelling bee in High School. 47th Street Station. And you'd better get right down here. Oh you .. you .. overstuffed pelvis. Why don't you mind your own business? Why don't you lock a man up like you're supposed to do? Say, what right have you to go calling people up? You fosset-nosed round-faced baboon. - Ah, shut up. Ah, you said that before, you web-footed troglodyte. Anything else? - Yeah. Just this .. I suppose you know I had to pull a lot of strings to get you out of that jam. Why didn't you let me know you were going off on a binge? I might have gone with you. Mr Pritcham is expecting me, Lawton. Mr Pritcham is upstairs with Mr Parker, Miss. But .. Mr Parker is in the shower, Miss. That's alright, Lawton. When you come out of there I want a word with you. Hello Terry. I know .. you want a towel. History tells us there's little use in declaring war on Police Departments. Running away. That's another useless thing. Hello, Terry. You know .. There's a certain class of people, you just won't be run away from. It's impossible. Utterly, utterly impossible. Why you're not going to marry this .. this man? In the lexicon of youth, aunt Martha, there's no such word as 'impossible'. Amy, aunt Martha is right. It's impossible. Will you please excuse us? I want to speak to my niece. Aunt Martha, I'm afraid you are going to need my help. In order to have a good chance with Amy we'll have to present a united front. Mr Parker .. I ask you again to leave us. But I agree with you. I'm on your side. On the side of truth, common sense and logic. I see, you are going to be noble. I'm going to be honest. Let's face the facts. Do you mind if I face them sitting down? I've had a busy day. There is Walter Pritcham. In love with Amy. Thoroughly responsible. A wealthy pillar of the community. Safe, sane, sound. Truly a veritable 'Gibraltar'. And here is Terence C. Parker. The 'C' stands for Clarence. A scoundrel without a single saving grace. Aunt Martha is only guilty of understatement. He's thoroughly irresponsible. A pauper. A social outcast and a lunatic. He'd lead you a dog's life, this Parker fellow. But I love this Parker fellow. - Amy, you've got to listen to reason. Now Gibraltar can give you everything. - But I don't want anything. With Gibraltar you're sure of happiness. That depends on what you call 'happiness', Mr Parker. I'm of no account. Worthless. My life stopped two years ago. I'm miserable. I'll only make you miserable too. You'll never know a minute's rest, or a day's contentment. Oh, it all sounds so wonderful. Alright .. get your hat. Amy. Where are you going? Amy .. That you may so live together in this life. And in the world to come, you may have life .. everlasting. Amen. Thank you, sir. Thanks for a beautiful ceremony. Thank you very much. Everything went off nicely. Thank you, sir. Oh. My compliments to the organist. The music was splendid. I was thinking .. perhaps, a little wedding breakfast? Hungry? Neither am I. Thank you. Where were you planning to live? Funny .. I never gave that a thought. Do you like Long Island? Do you? - No. Neither do I. Thank you. - Thanks. That settles the housing problem. Listen well. I have a little six-room house out in Patchogue. Out where the pavement ends. American colonial. It has a bed that Washington never slept in. And it hasn't been rented since the Indians left. I was thinking perhaps, after the honeymoon. When you're ready to sort-of settle a bit. I'd like you to take it. - It sounds grand. Doesn't it? - Just a moment, my dear. There are other things to consider. Any ground? - A nicely run-down two acres. Plumbing, heating-system okay? The Indians never complained. Well .. what are you asking for it? Well, let's see now. Patchogue. Fashionable neighbourhood, six rooms, two acres of ground. And .. there's a small car out there. Tinker with it a bit and it might run. Would .. Five dollars a month be too much? To be perfectly frank, Pritcham, we hadn't expected to pay quite so much. You see .. we're very poor. My husband wouldn't allow me to take one penny from aunt Martha. Oh. I might make it four-and-a-half. But that's rock bottom. Well, if it really has a bed that Washington never slept in. Does the four-and-a-half include gardener and water? Well .. we're not promising anything. Well, we'll look it over. Terry. Terry! Yes, darling. I know you mean well. But you can finish those pantry-knobs later. You can't be too careful about these things. It's how neighbours judge you. 'How are her pantry-knobs'? It's what they want to know. Yes darling, I know. Now come along .. come along. I want you to get the car and drive to the nearest phone. Call the electric company and ask them to turn on the lights immediately. Information will give you the number. Then call the phone company. Say we want the phone connected as soon as possible. Got that straight? Of course I have. I'm not such an imbecile as people think. You leave my aunt out of this. - Ha, ha, ha .. And while you're downtown stop at the market. We've got to get in some staples that are necessary. Make a list there, darling. Ready? - Yes. Bread .. salt .. pepper. Sugar .. flour. - Cinnamon? Yes, dear. Cinnamon. Baking soda, cornflakes. - Farina. Yes, dear. Farina. Canned soup, canned tomatoes, sardines. Oh, I saw some sardines once. In blue cans and red cans. What color would you like? I'll leave the color scheme to you, dear. Then coffee .. milk .. cream. Butter and eggs. All I can think of at the moment. Don't you forget anything, now. - Ney, ney. Hello. - Terry, there's no light yet. Should there be? - Well, didn't you? Oh darling, sorry. But in the excitement of buying, it must have slipped my mind. Alright .. it doesn't matter. At least we've got food. - There we are. All set for the winter. Where's the bread? - Bread? Oh yes, bread. Why, how could I have forgotten it? Bread, the staff of life. Tinned shrimps. Don't bother to look in there any more. They're all shrimps. Oh. - Yes. That's the caviare section there. All caviare? That's p?t? de foie-gras. All p?t? de foie-gras. They must have put anchovies in there. - Anchovies? Caviare .. p?t? de foie-gras and shrimp. Oh, there are other staples there too. Now there's sardines .. Cinnamon .. farina. Isn't that what you wanted? Yes, Terry .. that's what I wanted. Well. I'll get some kind of dinner together. Amy. Yes? It's an engagement ring. I'm an awful baby, Terry. I guess I just was terribly tired. Because of a sweet idiot. I'm not a bit tired, somehow. That's fine, darling. Tomorrow, you have to get up at 6:30. And look for a job. A job? What's that? You will find out, my sweet. Amy .. we never should have taken this place. Gibraltar misrepresented the conditions. How? Washington has slept in this bed. How do you know? They left his boots and spurs in the mattress. We'll fix the place up someday. Go to sleep now. You've got to get up at 6:30. He left his sword too. If you ask me. [ Snoring ] [ Snoring ] [ Snoring. Loud ] Goodbye, dear. - Goodbye. Goodbye, dear. - Bye. Goodbye dear. - Bye. See you tonight. Darling. When in Rome, you know .. - Of course. Darling, when I come home tonight I'll be a financial giant. I'll be known as: 'Parker: Wolf of Wall Street'. Or 'Parker the Millionaire Magnate'. Or 'Parker something'. 'Parker the job holder'. That's enough for me. Bye, dear. Pardon me. Didn't you just take over Pritcham's place on Country Club Drive? My name is Harold Thornton. I'm practically a neighbour of yours. Well, I'm Terence C. Parker. The 'C' stands for Clarence. Always does, doesn't it? Welcome to Patchogue, Parker. You'll find it a fine place to live in. - I'm sure I will, Thornton. Oh, there's Jim Smalley and Ted Drew. How would you like to make a fourth at bridge? Just to get acquainted. You sure you want me to? - Of course. Terry, this is Jim Smalley. And good old Ted Drew. Meet Terry Parker, boys. - How are you? Better known as good old Terry Parker. Sit down. Parker has taken over Pritcham's place. - Oh, that's fine. I see The Tribune is favoring Culbertson to beat Simms. That's my guess too. I don't know. If I was a betting man, I'd take Simms. What do you think, Parker? Well .. I'm inclined to agree with you, Thornton. Culbertson is the better boxer. Simms packs the punch. But give me the man with the punch every time. That's pretty good. You mean, as bridge players they're a pair of good fighters. Right, judging by their last scrap at the .. Are they bridge players? I didn't know that. You see, I've never played bridge before. Pass. One heart. Two diamonds. Oh. I'm supposed to say something? Six clubs. - What? Come on now, old man. What say we play some bridge? After all, we only have forty minutes for it. Didn't I say the right number? Frankly, it was the first one that came into my mind. As I said, I've never played bridge before. Really? You've never played bridge before? But I'm perfectly willing to learn. - I'd be glad to teach you sometime. Yes, I think with a few pointers every morning, for six or seven weeks. I should hold my own with you boys. - Yeah. [ Buzzer ] Oh .. - Ah .. Hospitality. - Sorry, Walter. Is Terry with you? Walter, what's happened? Where's Terry? Amy .. promise me you'll be calm. Walter, tell me what's happened. Where's Terry? Terry is .. In the kitchen. Oh .. you fool, you. What's that? - A Dachshund. A Dachshund drinking milk. - Oh, it's adorable. I'm glad you like him. I didn't want to come home empty-handed. You know .. No job? Not today. Don't fret, little woman. I'll be the Rajah of railroads or the Merchant Mandarin of something. So you'll be alone a good deal. So. Has he got a name? - There's only one name for him: 'Max'. 'Max J Dog'. See, when we get some money we can put on a bit of swank .. And change that to .. 'J Max Dog'. Thinking of money, how are you fixed? I offered your husband a job. Well, I'll ease your mind on that my friend. I don't want a job. Why should I? I have your friendship, Amy's love, and Max's indifference. I have 100 dollars in the bank and 400 shares of stock I am happy to say .. Is the most worthless on the market. 'Overland Express Inc'. So you see .. So you see, we're just sitting pretty. What did you say? Overland Express? [ Aircraft noise. Flying above ] Walter .. did you really have a job for Terry? Yes .. but he didn't want that or any other job. Surrounded by four walls. I see. You've worked wonders already. He is different, Amy. For the first time since that terrible accident I've noticed a change in him. Do you really think so, Walter? Now, if we can keep him out of a plane. And you continue to give unstintingly of your patient and generous affection. It's only a matter of time before you'll have him round to .. Poor devil. Flying in the fog. It's nine-thirty. Are we going to wait any longer for dinner? No, aunt Martha. I think we should start. Come along. You go in, and I'll bring the food right in. Alright, dear. How long is this going to last? - Well, aunt Martha. Don't try to fool me, Amy. I know you too well. Why this man hasn't any fundamental decency, leaving you here alone all day. Coming home at any hour. And not even bothering to phone. I don't mind. I expect that. That's Terry .. that's what I knew would happen when I married him. And do you think it's quite right for him to treat you so shabbily? Darling, listen to me. I took Terry knowing all about him. I made a bargain, and I'm going to stick to it. No matter what happens. Until I feel I'm not doing him any good at all. That I'm the wrong woman for him. The same old story, isn't it? Young, romantic girl marries a man .. to reform him. I don't want to reform him just for me. Oh, it's for me too, I suppose. But .. most of all, for himself. He can be so charming, so fine. Such a really grand person. If he'd just get the idea out of his head that he's alone in the world. That what he does, or how he does it, makes no difference. If I can do that, aunt Martha. Just that. Then I'll feel I've gotten out of life everything I want. And if I can't .. I've failed. Well .. then I'll give up. No matter how much I love him. Now .. now I'll bring the soup. It's really lovely soup. Hello. - Evening, sir. You're aunt Martha's chauffeur, aren't you? Mrs Prentiss? Yes, sir. - Oh, right. Hello, Terry. - Hello. Aunt Martha's here. - Oh. Remember, I told you. - Oh yes. Glad to see her. She'll be going in a moment. Well, I'll pass the pipe of peace. I learned how from an old Indian Chief. Whom I befriended as he lay dying in the Black Hills of South Dakota. You must be starved. Come in and have .. Oh no. I had a sandwich and a bottle of beer with an old pal of mine. A flyer I knew in China. This chap has the greatest idea you ever heard for refuelling in the air. Now, listen to this. All you need is a plane with .. Hello, aunt Martha. - Good evening. Aunt Martha's asked us for dinner and theatre on Tuesday, Terry. I said I'd ask you. I didn't know whether you were busy or not. Well, that's very nice of you aunt Martha .. why sure. We're both busy Amy, aren't we? Don't you remember? The Schwarnbassles are coming for dinner. Or was it the Basslechwassels? Or whatever their name is? Some other time, aunt Martha. Thanks, just the same. Terry, have you plans for the future? - I don't believe in the future. Never had a plan in my life. If I had one I wouldn't know what to do with it. No .. you wouldn't. Let me tell you something, young man .. it's time you did. Do you think so? - I certainly do. I'm not going to stand by any longer and see Amy miserable and unhappy. Because of your stupid callousness. Haven't we been through all this before? You married Amy against my wishes and her better judgement. But that doesn't give you the privilege of wrecking her life. I will not tolerate it. I tell you I will not. I tell you what you should do. Mind your own business. Oh .. Oh! I quite understand, Martha. Terry didn't mean it. My dear, I never want to see that man again. Please, aunt Martha. I'm terribly sorry. Amy. Amy .. don't you think you've made a mistake? Aunt Martha's right .. it is impossible. And you are unhappy. Don't you think you'd better go back to aunt Martha's? You'll wake up tomorrow morning in a lovely room. Another world. A sane and beautiful world. Among friends. With the comfort of security. And the beginning of happiness again. Won't you go? Goodnight, dear. But Amy, you've got to listen to me. You mustn't think this is a temporary idiocy of mine. It isn't. It is my credo, my platform. I shall always be on the wrong side of the road. Outside, looking in. I'll never change. Won't you go back to aunt Martha? Sorry. I've simply got to stay to see what makes you tick that funny way. Goodnight, dear. Goodnight. [ Doorbell ] Terry, I'm afraid. That's the first time anyone but you or Walter or me has rung that front bell. It's my theory that it's some pilgrim who's lost his way. And is making inquiries about his bearings. Or some urchin ringing bells in rehearsal for Halloween. Oh, half urchin, half pilgrim. A telegram for Mr Parker. - Read that, Amy. Must be the Washington Society going to put a tablet over my bed. Thank you. Terry, listen. - Yes, yes. Livewright offers twenty a share for Overland Express. Congratulations. Walter. Fancy that, now. How many shares we got? - I don't know. Didn't you say four hundred? - That's right. Terry .. we're plutocrats. We're worth eight thousand dollars. Oh, my darling .. Amy .. Champagne. - But of course, Champagne. No. Wait. There isn't any. There never has been any. But there is milk. Lots of milk. - Grade A? Pasteurized? Oh, congratulations, Terry. - My lucky star. My clever husband. Gentlemen, a toast. To what shall it be? - Let's be frank. To the $8,000. No .. no, to the new regime. Let's see. Upstairs bedroom completely refurnished. New rugs, drapes, curtains. I can make most of those myself. Altogether about $1,000 and we have a brand-new home. And do you think we can afford a new inexpensive car? Is it so much, Terry? There'll be enough for a new and very expensive car. We're through stinting. Rugs from Damascus, spices from India .. Nectar from .. Oh yes .. and there is something I must get for myself. Plaid drapes for upstairs. Slips for the living room. What, Terry? - You'll see. Thank you, madam. Taxi, ma'am? No thanks. Yes please. Put those there, will you please. Terry. Here you are. Thanks. Terry! Hello, Terry. - Isn't it great? What is it? Just what are you planning? Is this some new irrigation project, or agriculture on a large scale or what? It's nothing as primitive as irrigation or agriculture. My plan teems with timeliness. It's as modern as the morning paper. It will be the vital force of the future. Yes, of course, Terry. Now, just what's it all about? Aviation, Amy. You've heard of it. Those worthy men will clear the back-lot and make it fit for a landing field. After that, they'll put up a makeshift hangar. And I figure, with the agreed method, I should be through in about three days. I see. - Yes. Not only that .. What do you intend to put into this hangar? Well, the most suitable thing to put in an aeroplane hangar is an aeroplane. Don't you think so? - Yes. I have a surprise for you. - No .. it won't be a surprise. You've gone and bought yourself a plane, haven't you? Yep .. I'm going in business. You .. you're what? - I'm going in business. Listen, Amy. With a plane, an amphibian. I can take commuters from here to Wall Street. At so much per person. Now, it takes an hour and a half on the train. And it only takes fifteen minutes the Parker way. Why, we'll clean up. Oh. Of course, I'll have to be a little modest for a while. I don't suppose I'll make anything in the first year. Probably lose some. But it's the coming business, Amy. And .. and I'll be in the air. The plane .. everything .. how much? Well, it's second-hand but it's a beauty. How much, Terry? - Well, now, that's .. That's going to take a little figuring .. let me see. The cost of the plane. Leasing the extra ground. Hangar. Labour. Implements. And of course, your salary as field manager. I hope you're not going to be too unreasonable about that salary. You know, I always had to cheat at math in school to pass. This brings it all back to me. The amount comes to ten thousand .. 121 dollars dollars and 76 cents. Don't look so aghast, Amy. After all, I have eight thousand. It means I'll have to dig up two thousand more. That's all. That should be easy. I've spent the last two days in town buying things. Furniture .. rugs .. lamps. Everything that goes into making a beautiful home. It's what I've been thinking of for months, Terry. A really beautiful home. That's been my plan. No .. no, more than a plan. It's been my dream. What of that now, Terry? That's tough. But after all Amy, this is business. You know we're .. Ah .. smile .. Frown. Well little Amy, do something. Information, please. I want to speak to Stones, Tower Square, New York. What do you want me to do, Amy? I'll do it. About the plane? I don't care one way or the other. Hello, Stones? I want to cancel an order. How's this strike you, Amy? - It's fine, dear. Too bad we haven't any Champagne. Would you say that's very good ketchup? - It's good ketchup. Amy, do me the honor. I christen thee 'Amy'. Well done, Amy. The first of the Parker 'Patchogue to Wall Street' fleet is launched. Step right in, Madame and join the inaugural flight. No fee at all. Compliments of management. Look, I tell you I'd rather not. But Madame, it's the Amy's first flight. No, Terry. Oh well, never mind. I won't be long. Just about ten minutes. I'm leaving you, Terry. Oh, take off those silly clothes, Amy. And get about preparing the vittles. But before I go, there's something I must say to you. Yes? - I will .. I'll try to be simple and straightforward. Terry .. this attitude of yours towards life. This contempt you have for people and the world. All this dashing around of yours. All the flying about. The unhappiness. The unrest. Can mean just one thing. There's a void in your life, Terry. A distinct and terrible void. I thought when I married you that I could fill that void. I thought I could take what was wrong with you and right it. But I haven't. Oh, understand me. You haven't failed as a husband, Terry. It's I who has failed. I haven't cured you of your troubles. I haven't righted what was wrong with you. Why, I haven't even made you happy. Really. I failed as your wife. You asked me so many times to leave. Well, now I'm obeying you. That certainly is beautiful talk, Amy. It just isn't logical, that's all. Now I .. I've changed my mind. I want you to stay. Don't Terry .. please. Don't talk. Don't touch me. Amy. Shall I take you to the station, Amy? No thanks. I've ordered a taxi. There's one thing I would like to say. I love you, Amy. I don't think you're a failure. Really, I don't. - I've tried, Terry. But I just don't seem able to help you. Perhaps without me .. Well, don't you see? It all sounds so absurd but .. I love you too, Terry. That's why I'm going. Did you ring for a cab? Yes, ma'am. Bobby Trent was very funny tonight I thought. But you, Amy. You were positively the life of the party. Was I? How awful. Amy, why don't you and aunt Martha take a run up to the Adirondacks, or Maine. Bar Harbor is nice this time of year. - I'd love to, Walter. But I'm afraid I can't. Well .. you must be tired. Shall I run along? - Well, I'm not a bit tired. But maybe you'd better go, Walter. - Of course. Goodnight, Amy. - Goodnight, Walter. Oh, but that's the ideal time to leave any party. In the beginning. I like the sound of your voice. I'd like to hear more of it. Won't you say something nice and long? I'd like to present an old friend of mine. General Sherman. And here is Terence C. Parker. The 'C' stands for Clarence. I saw some sardines once. In blue cans and red cans. What color would you like? I shall always be on the wrong side of the road. Outside looking in. I haven't changed a bit. There's one thing I would like to say. I love you, Amy. I don't think you're a failure. Really, I don't. I seem to be in the unfortunate position with you two of 'perennial persuader'. A professional fixer. But I do think you'd better go back to him .. he's pretty miserable. So am I .. but I'm not going back. Oh, I want him. I want him so very much. Every human instinct in me cries out to go running back to him. I need him, Walter. But I mustn't think of that. I've got to think of his needs. I'm just not made for him. That's all. Walter. It was very kind of you to give Terry that $8,000. Give? - Yes. I've been asking people about Overland Express. They say it's even more worthless than ever. It isn't even listed on the Bourse? It was very kind of you, Walter. But it wasn't very nice. Hello. Goodbye, Amy. - Goodbye, Walter. Don't feel badly. You're such a grand person. Goodbye. Will you tell Mr Parker please, I'm leaving my car for him. Yes, sir. What do I have to do to get you back? I don't know, Terry. One day you'll come to me and .. Something in the way you stand, Something in the way you speak. Just, something about you. Oh, it won't be anything you've done. It won't be any visible or tangible sign that you are different. It will just be that 'something'. And I'll know that you've done, what .. What I've tried to do and .. Failed to help you at it. I'll know you are no longer running along a ragged precipice. On that day. You won't have to ask me to come back. I'll come running. Begging you to take me back. But you never did like me the way I am? - Oh, I like you. I love you .. so much it .. But I can't be on the outside any longer. Watching you jump about in this, this cage you've built for yourself. I won't. I won't be a nursemaid to your stupid delusions. And I won't pet and coddle you. Oh, don't you understand, dearest? I want to get inside of you. Inside of your heart and your brain. I want you, Terry. Can't you see? I want you. Then I'll never have you back. You see. There's no use my taking up any more of your .. Your life. Yes, Mrs Parker. Here he is now. A request. Mrs Parker wishes you to return to her apartment. Give Mrs Parker my profoundest love. Ah, Mr Parker. Mr Pritcham left his car for you. Thanks. Yes? Well, let me speak to him. Terry .. Terry! Amy, darling .. what is it? There, dear. There .. don't .. Was I really as funny as all that? You weren't funny at all. I just want to laugh. Well, come on, let's go to the Gordon's. I want an early start. I can't afford to lose one precious moment, you know. I'm living on velvet now. Fashion velvet. Amy Parker favors velvet this season. You're wanted on the phone, sir. We drive up in the morning. No. I never want to set foot in a car again. We'll fly up in the morning. - Alright with me. We charter a plane. Everybody's invited. - That's right. Yes? Yes, Lawton? Your car has been in an accident, Mr Pritcham. Just a few moments ago. The other side of Queensboro Bridge. A little amusement park. What? How badly? Thank you, Lawton. Amy .. may I speak to you a moment? Excuse me, will you? - Surely. You and I are going some place and we've got to go right away. Something has happened to Terry? Hurt bad? - I don't know. He's there, anyway. That's a miracle. Eighty miles an hour on this curve. What's all the tiptoeing about? What's all the whispering for? They think I'm going to die, do they? I'll die when I get good and ready. Not a minute before. Nobody is going to tell me how to die. And when I do .. I'll be in the air. - Terry. Terry, listen to me. I love you .. I want you. I'll be what you want me to be. I'll do what you want me to do. You mustn't die, Terry. - Don't worry about me. I'm not going to die yet. And when I do. It won't be on the filthy ground. Everything seems different. Even the General. Does he? Amy. There's something I've been saving to tell you. At this moment. - Yes, Terry? You've been a grand nurse. And certainly a grand companion. But .. The job is over. You're free, Amy. But I don't want to be free. Freedom is overrated. - You mean that, darling? Do you? - Yes, Terry. As I lay on the ground that night, looking up at you. I realized that I wanted you more than anything else. As you lay on the ground that night, Terry. I told you that I loved you. More than anything else. I said it then, and I say it now. Do whatever you like, be whatever you want. I want you. I love you. Amy. If you love me, you'll stop talking about a Terry Parker .. That doesn't even exist anymore. Love, General. Something I learned from an old Indian Chief. Whom I befriended as he lay dying in the Black Hills of South Dakota. ..f-s..
