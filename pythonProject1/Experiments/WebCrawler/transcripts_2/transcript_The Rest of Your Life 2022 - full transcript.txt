We haven't had a new guy here in a while. Everyone's very excited, champing at the bit. Yeah. I'm excited. I know your type. I know your type. You're one of these fancy two year training program, guys. You know, you're right out of school. Take the world by the horns. I don't know. Maybe. I was one of 'em too. I know what you're thinking. I'm not gonna be here in two years. I'm not gonna be here. I'm gonna go get my MBA. Go see the world. Last guy who was in your role. That's what he's doing. You know? It's not like New York. It's, it's not headquarters, but you might like it here. We're like a family. Why don't we go meet the team? Huh? Please welcome, Brian Jeffries. (staff applauds) Brian, Stanley. Hey Brian, I'm Stanley. Accounts receivable. Its nice to meet you. You got James, payroll. Hey Brian, did you not get the business casual memo? It wasn't in the welcome package. That's alright. Things around here aren't too formal. You can even wear jeans on Friday. Oh, okay. And over here we have Wanda, accounting. Hi, Brian. Welcome to your new home. Hey. Hey, Brian. Tony. Hey. - Compliance. Nice to meet you. Tony's been here since college. Well, yeah, not a day more. Check out your desk. Huh? I'll put a ticket in with facilities for Brain Jeffries. Oh, geez. Somebody screwed up. Well, this is, this is your new home. This is Brian's home. Or should I say Brain's home? Cause they, they got it wrong. Right. And you don't have to dress like that if you don't want to. Oh, okay. You look like you came from your first communion. Yeah, I guess so. So, what can I get started with? I mean, I know that kids in New York have some sort of week long training. Yeah. Don't worry about New York. You know, that was where my original offer was for. And then I picked Columbus, so. Yeah, we're not so formal around here. There's gonna be some internal trainings that you'll need to do. Make sure you're up to speed with compliance and regulations of the bank. But - Yeah. Other than that, pretty straightforward. Okay and can I, Can I access those on my computer here? You sure can access them on your computer. Let me get... Up here. Sorry. You want to be real tight with the core when you get down this. Sometimes I work like this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Safety Trainer] Welcome to the Am era Bank workplace active shooter safety training module. What is this? Whoa. [Safety Trainer] Will give you all the tools. I'm not sure why it started with [Safety Trainer] the event of an active shooter... The active shooter training module. You know this one's actually pretty tough. You're gonna wanna to take notes. I've failed a lot of these. So just, focus up. [Safety Trainer] Once upon a time active shooters, where were they? All right, so I'll leave you to it. Yeah, uh, cool. Thanks Chief. Morning, Keith. Morning. Who's that? Guy used to work in finance. Didn't quite stick. What happened? Just stay away from that guy. Okay. [Safety trainer] In the event of an active shooter at Am era Bank, your first option is to run. If there is nowhere to run, hide. Possible shelters may include the break room, the supply closet or under your desk. When those options are exhausted, you can engage the shooter with a nearby blunt instrument such as a keyboard or a stapler. Okay, that doesn't seem safe. [Safety Trainer] The more staples, the better. If such an item is not available, immediately wrestle and disarm. Oh, God. [Safety Trainer] Click the quiz button for a quiz. (cheery music) (coffee machine buzzing) [Keith] Okay. Same time tomorrow knuckleheads. Brian, what are you doing here man? It's 5:01. Oh, I was just finishing up something. Yeah. Brian, one of the best things about working in a satellite office is that we don't really believe in face time. It's more about work, life balance, you know? So you get your work done and then you get outta here pretty straightforward. So everyone finished their work exactly at five o'clock today? Well, Brian it's a, it's a nine to five, right? It's not a 9:00 to 4:30. Whenever Brian feels like going home and chomping on some fruity pebbles, right? Right. Yeah. So I'd love to stick around and chat, but it's Monday and at the Ziegler household, that means Mrs. Ziegler's got a little bit of something waiting for me. That something is a chicken pot pie. So I'm excited. I'm gonna get outta here. See you tomorrow. See you Keith. (Upbeat cheerful music) (soft somber music) (soft background voices) (heart beating) (printing machine beeping) Brian. Bri guy. The old copier. Hey Keith, how's it going? You know another day in paradise. Nothing to complain about. Plus it's Friday. Yeah. Right. You got any plans this weekend? Oh, no plans. Just putting together some furniture. Oh, I remember the IKEA days. Oh, man. You probably have a sweet bachelor pad? Well I guess so. You got anything you need help with? I really don't have much I'm working on right now. You know? Um, no. Uh, no. But I do love that initiative. That, I have that. So you're, you're doing, doing great though. But I'm not really doing much yet. You are a riot. Um, now that I think about it, there is something you can help me with. Yeah. Yeah. Anything. I'll help with anything. So on Fridays, once a month, me, James, Matthew, Stanley. We go down to this little microbrew for a little happy hour. We call it the Fine Finance Club. You should come with. I, I really gotta go put together this desk tonight. I really don't like you working from home. Oh no, no, no. It's not for that. Its just... I'm just joking. I'm just joshing. Just joshing with ya again. Okay? I'm just pull, I'm pulling your leg. Right? Okay. Well, is there anything that you need help with today? I'll see you there. Huh? (upbeat music) [James] I don't know. I'm kinda getting sick of cutting my own grass. [Matthew] Yeah. We just started paying the neighbor kid to do it. I got tired of him begging for work. Not me. I'm out on the John Deere every Saturday. Best part about having two acres. I'll tell you that. [Stanley] Brian, you got a yard? No, just an apartment. Maybe you could start with some succulents. I'd start with a snake plant. Hey guys. Just wanna take a minute. Congratulate Brian on a great first month of work, huh? Only 39 more years and 48 weeks to go. How long have you guys been coming here? As long as I've been in Am era Bank. I think Eisenhower was still president. Jurassic Period for me. (everyone laughs) Hey, it's a good excuse for me to get away from little ones, you know? Yeah. Wait little ones? Stanley, how old are you? 27. Got two twin boys. They come at you fast. Just you wait. I bet. Brian. I want you to consider this you're official welcome to the table. Cheers. [Colleagues] Cheers. Cheers. Congratulations. And I'll say it again. You've been doing a bang up job. Lot of work you're putting in. But I'm hardly doing anything. Working hard or hardly working. He's catching on. (colleagues laugh) Yeah. Just a joke, Brian. I know we're not as funny as your college roommates, but you are stuck with us. If they're anything like my college buddies, those guys know a thing or two about the chikkas. Hey Brian, you got a girl here in Columbus? Yeah. Well, not in Columbus. Oh, long distance lover. The best kind. So, uh, where is she? And does she have any friends for us? (colleagues cheer and laugh) Yeah. I'm just joking. I'm very happily married and I'm very scared of my wife. So please don't tell her I said that. [Matthew] Yeah. So where's your girlfriend, Brian? Oh, she's in New York. Med school. Ah. New York. The Big Apple. The city that never sleeps. The New York Jets. Rockets. [Brian] Yeah. She's there for the summer doing research and then she starts school in the fall. So. New York's quite a trip from Ohio. Yeah. I'm sure it'll work out. I'm sure it will, Brian. Which sounds great. Yeah. Well speaking of which I'm gonna get outta here. Her and I have a Face Time date scheduled. Yeah. Don't worry about it. Glad you can make it for a few beers and those Face Time dates. Those are important. Cherish her. All right. Well I'm gonna get outta here. Yeah. Go do your thing. See you tomorrow, Brian. - Take it easy. See you tomorrow? Tomorrow? Yeah. - Saturday. Yeah. We work on Saturday sometimes. What? - Yeah. We don't close mean. Come on. - You didn't get the memo? We're just Joshing. (colleagues laugh) You should have seen your face. (mimics Brian) You're never gonna get it. (upbeat music) (Face Time dial tone) Amanda? Amanda? (Mischievous upbeat music) (airplane thump-rumbles) (upbeat music continues) (Brian knocks) Amanda, did you miss me? Brian. I missed you. What are you doing here? I wanted to surprise you. I got my first paycheck and I figured who else would I wanna spend it on? You know? You can't just show up like this. Why not? When you visit, you're supposed to book like a whole weekend. I wanted to surprise you and now I'm here. And last night I just couldn't get you outta my head. And I said, you know what? I need to be here with Amanda. I need to be here. [Steven] Amanda? Who's that? Uh, it's my roommate, Shelly's boyfriend. Hm, I can't wait to meet Shelly and him too. Maybe we can double date. - Yeah. [Steven] Amanda! Jesus. What does this guy want? Uh, I don't know. I don't know. Shelly's not here right now. She'll be back in an hour. So go to her room. Yeah, man. Go to her room. [Steven] Amanda. Oh. Jesus man. Put some clothes on. My God. Amanda, you said you weren't dating this guy anymore? What the hell is he talking about? You're still in a relationship? Well, I, I mean, we were going to break up. Break up? What, what the hell is going on? Brother, I had no idea you were still together. Yes. We're still together. That's not what she said, brother. Stop calling me brother. Brother. I'm telling you she didn't mention this. I didn't get any kind of vibe of "I'm taken." Steven, shut up. Brian, listen to me, honey. I can explain. Yeah. This better be good. Okay. I'm here in New York and I don't know anybody. You said you were making friends. Right. And Steven, Steven works at the hospital. I've been looking for this little guy. [Amanda] Yeah. And, and you know, we've just been hanging out and here we are. Should I, should I go or? You stay right there, Steven. Okay. Spectator sports. Some people like to be watched. Amanda, you and I were supposed to be in a relationship, yet here you are fucking a Steven. It's Dr. Steven. Uh, who said we're fucking? We're fucking, come on. That is not your place to say that. Can you please put on some pants? I had to come clean. I, I, I cannot tell a lie. Hippocratic oath. Do you know what? That doesn't even make sense. I'm real sorry about this, brother. I am not your brother. Fuck off. Okay. I'm gonna go. Amanda, I'll see you at the hospital. Yeah. See you. Brian, right? Yeah, man. What, what do you want? I'm only an Oncologist, but I could recommend a good couple's therapist if you need one. Just, just get the fuck out. Yes. Steven, go. Okay. I cannot believe this. I mean, Jesus Christ, Amanda. There are plenty of girls in Columbus. You don't see me making the moves on any of them. Yeah, on who? Wanda from accounting? All you do is work, eat, sleep, and watch TV. You're not meeting anyone. I'm not trying to meet anyone. We're in a relationship. Clearly you've forgotten that in the one month we've been apart. Yes. One month with 11 more and three years after that. And then another four years while I'm in residence and who knows where the hell that's gonna be? I mean the thought of doing long distance for eight years. Come on, Brian. I can't do that. We can't do that. We can do this. Why do you wanna do this? Because I'm, I'm here. I'm here in New York. Yeah. You're here. And then you're gone again on Monday and I won't see you for another month. That's not a real relationship. But it's our relationship. Well, I don't think I want that. We can figure this out. I mean, is there any way you can re-enroll in Columbus? Brian, my spot there is long gone. Well, then I'll get a job here in New York. You don't wanna do that. I'll do anything. Can't you just accept that we had a good run? This isn't how it's supposed to be. You know? I, I love you. I love you too. That's why this is so hard. You've got a lot ahead of you, Brian. Yeah, what am I supposed to do? You have the rest of your life to figure that out. (Slow somber music) For Brian, right? [Cab Driver] Yeah. ♪ Through West Virginia. ♪ Hi. Yeah.

It's alright. Relax. George Pfeiffer. Brian Jeffries. I'm in finance. Right on. I think I've seen your face around here. You're new, right? Yeah. About a month in. How's the finance team? It's good. You know, good manager, nice people. The Fine Finance Club. Right? You know it? Yeah. Let's just say I'm not jumping outta my shorts to hang out at one of those things. Yeah. My bad. That's probably not what you want to hear. I'll let you hit it. I mean, I'm in no rush. You smoke? Sometimes, my girlfriend doesn't like it. Ex-girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend? (Brian coughs) You don't have to smoke. I want to. So what group are you in? Digital marketing. Anything that's not TV or print, which is everything. Interesting. - Yeah. You're a finance guy, right? Yeah. I guess. I don't know. I've only been this job for a month, man, but it is not what I expected it to be. Yeah. Nothing's really what you expect, right? That's why they say expect the unexpected. Yeah. It's just that dude I don't do anything at this job. Literally nothing. I mean... we just met, but take it with a grain of salt. I had a 40 hour work week. I probably work 10 hours substantive work, but I just get my work done. I respect people. I've done pretty well for myself. How long have you been here? Like eight. Fuck, Eight years. Eight years. So your ex she doesn't want you to smoke. [Brian] So I surprised her at her apartment in Manhattan, right? Only to find out that she's been hooking up with this dude named Steven and now we're broken up and I'm kinda having a quarter life crisis, panic attack right now. - Classic. And it's not like I can hit up any of my college friends about this, you know, like they're all off in their own cities, starting their own new jobs with their own girlfriends. And I guess when you're 22, you're supposed to just fend for your goddamn self. Yeah. Plus this job fucking sucks, man. I get in at nine, you know, literally do nothing for 30 minutes. Right. And then I go drink that shitty ass office coffee. Why are you drink? Don't Drink that. And then I take a dump. Right? And then I go to a status meeting with Keith and the boys. And then I get back to my desk and do all of my work for the week in about two hours. And then I go to lunch, which at this point is minimum an hour. Take An hour, at least. And then I just sit on my phone all day, looking at Instagram, staring at memes until five o'clock rolls around when Keith comes by. And he's like, same time tomorrow, knuckle heads. And everybody around me stands in unison. You know I can hear him down the hall. And then it's, it's back home Right. And I go for a little run, maybe two times a week tops. And then I order takeout and then I jerk off and then I watch Netflix for two hours. And then I jerk off again on my shitty ass Ikea bed. And then I wake up at 7:00 AM and I do it all over again all, right. And knowing that I have to do this for the next four decades and now all alone, Amanda gone. It's like, there's gotta be something better than this bank job, man. This crushing me. I'm a smart guy. I mean, maybe take it easy. You're a smart guy too, man. What the hell are you doing here? You should be like at a tech company or something. Tech comp. Why? Dude it at the end of the day, a paycheck's a paycheck. You're young. So you think like, oh, you know, it's sexy cause it's Facebook, but you're gonna still gonna have meetings. You're still gonna have a boss. You're still gonna have emails. Plus they pay me really well here. Okay. But like no offense. You seem like a more to life than money kind of guy. No, I'll take that as a compliment. I'd like more flexibility. So why don't you start your own company? Like a, well like a digital ad agency or something? I don't know. I've thought about it. Like, I don't know, man. Who's gonna pay my mortgage? My dad always calls that like the golden handcuffs kind of thing. Sure. Jesus man. I'm sorry. That sucks. You don't have to feel sorry for me I'm not the one whose girlfriend just cheated on him. I, I, I am sorry that that happened to you. Thanks man. Look, why don't we grab a couple guys Thursday, A guy? Couple Pat Rices'. A couple Tom Larrys What's a guy? Oh I call beers, guys. [Brian] Oh. Why? I don't know. Kind of fun. - Yeah. Get a Lou Dobbs in the system. The Fox news anchor? Yeah. I don't know if I want that in my system. [George] Get a Geno Auriemma going. He's the UConn women's basketball coach, right? Yeah. You in? Yeah, of course. I'm in, I'll grab a guy. I, I'll grab a couple guys. - Great. Yeah. Thursday. I mean, I should be free. I literally have no friends so. Oh. - In Columbus. Yeah. Listen, I'm gonna head back in, you know. Cause this is something like my eighth break. I don't want to actually get canned. We really need those nap pods On the third floor. There's a wellness room, single occupancy. And it locks from the inside, so. Really? - Hit it. [George] Grab yourself a snoops. It's a real game changer. Hey Keith, you wanted to see me? Yeah. Pop a squat. What's up? [Keith] So I noticed you made some changes to the budget tracker. Oh I just threw in the July numbers then added a couple charts so we could track our cash flow a little more easily. Right. So that tracker makes its way up the chain. And I don't think a lot of the big dogs are gonna be ready for these pretty major changes that you've made. They're not major changes though. I just thought it would be easier if we could see. Yeah, no, I, I, I get it, but there's really no reason to reinvent the wheel, right? No, I know, but I was just yeah, Yeah, no, I, I get it. You're trying to make a good impression. Put your best foot forward, but you're doing a good job. Just stick to the script. Huh? Thanks, but... So here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna take your doc. I'm gonna send it back to you. All right. You're gonna put it in the original template with the July numbers. Then send it all back. Sure. Awesome. That would rock. That'd be really super. While I got you. Any chance he caught that game? The game. Yeah. Big game. Huge game. The big game. The big game. Right? Big game. Can you believe that that team did that? I, the team, they, they did that. Crazy. Well, see ya. (upbeat funky music) Did you go home to put on a short sleeve paisley button down? This is my favorite shirt. Really? Yeah. Nordstrom Rack. Oh the Rack's kind of nice. Look at you. You're wearing a denim shirt in middle August. This is a summer piece. It is a fall piece at best. It breathes. It's lighter than it looks. Seriously. That girl over there is pretty cute, right? She's been, she's been looking over. [George] Yeah. Oh now you gonna have to go over there man. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going over there. I, I just got out of a six year relationship and I'm not going over there. What the hell does that have to do with anything? It has everything to do with everything. I, I was dating this girl in high school since I was a junior and we just like dated forever. And now here we are. So you've never had to talk to a girl at a bar? I don't know. No, I guess I'm just sort of a girlfriend guy. [George] Have you only been with Amanda? Yeah. Oh Legendary. No, no, no, no. I don't even know why I am telling you this. You're my coworker. Yeah, this is great. This is better than Keith and the Fine Musketeers. Whatever, I guess. Shit, she just saw me. She just saw me. What do I do? She already saw us. We're mates. What am I gonna say? What am I gonna say? "Hey." Yeah, "Hey" works. Don't just say, "Hey" and stand there. Okay. And then what? What's after that? You say, "Hey, I'm Brian." "Nice to meet you."

There's a clock on the nightstand next to the picture. I'm going home. Can I split an Uber with you? I think I sobered up now and I really need to get my car. [Stacy] Oh my God. Bye. Amanda. It's me. I just wanna talk. But I wanna talk to you. I just wanna hear your voice. I miss you. Hold on. Hold on. Amanda, I love you. Maybe we could still have phone sex sometime. I'm sorry for all the voice mails. I'll settle for your friendship. (upbeat music) (alarm tone) [Amanda] Brian, I'm blocking your number. You even Facebook messaged my mom. This is pathetic. I'm sorry that I hurt you, but I don't wanna be with someone who acts this way. Goodbye. Fuuuuck. (phone rings) Oh, Christ. Brian Brian Ohlaker. Hello? Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. What's up dude? Good morning, Keith. [Keith] You don't sound so good. Any woo, I'm bringing in assayed bowls for the gang, FSC. Want one? If I do anything I'll throw up. I can't hear you. I'm generating too much torque. I'll see you at the office. (upbeat music) Wake up. What's up? I don't know. Late night. Good late? Bad late. What happened with Stacy? Can you guys keep it down? Sorry Wanda. (Wanda mumbles) I'm going for Ices. Come on, let's go. I don't know. I got in pretty late. I should probably just lay low. Ugh. Honestly, dude, you're killing me. (upbeat music) [George] Does this look right to you? My side mirror will not straighten. You know, to be honest, I can't really tell from my vantage point, George. [George] So she left and then she left you said because she saw a picture of your ex. Yes. Yes. Wow. Dude. That is epic. Truly unheard of. Aha! Picture of the ex. [Brian] I haven't thrown it away. I'm like, wait, you know where the hell are we going anyways? What? Just a little coffee house. It's a little number, bit of a drive. I can't do this office coffee shit. Okay. Who this guy? I'ma hit him. He's fucking, I don't give a shit if it's free. I could care less Probably one of these naked at home guys. Those guys? Oh, you see he studies? I save $600 a year if I make it at home. Who the fuck cares? Well, they got a sea brew at this place that will really get you going? (Jazzy upbeat music) Wait, so did you and Monica? I don't know. I saw you leave with her. Did you guys, you know... What, have sex? Yeah. No. She came back to my place. I'm not into the meaningless sex. That surprises me, cause you seem like a total pickup artist out there. Well, I mean I'll still go out. One thing leads to another, so be it. But I'm not looking for it. I'd rather it be something real. Yeah. But I'm in my thirties, man. You know? Yeah. You're young. You're single. You should live your life. Why don't you call Stacy? Yeah. I don't think that's gonna happen. She got pretty weirded out when I told her that I liked her. Oh, do you like her? I don't even know. [George] Yeah. I just, I just said it. Yeah. That seems soon. Met her last night. That's all right. You're probably fine. So bummed, you know. Last night, like I thought it was gonna be this thing. Yeah. Something new after Amanda. [George] We were talking about this just last night. Right? What did we say? All you said last night was good. I wanted her to cheat on me. Good Don't mock me. If anything, you should be happy. You had a good time last night. I guess. Dude. Sex, relationships, dating. Stuff's a process. Stop judging yourself. It's just that when I envision my life, I see girlfriend, fiance and get married. Maybe having kids and living in the suburbs and the job and climbing the ladder. This is the that we're talking about its in your head, but you not gonna figure it out in the next 10 minutes here with me. Right? Like look at it this way. You have this cookie cutter upbringing. Cookie cutter house, cookie cutter parents. There's a right way to live. There's a certain look that you want your life to have in order to be happy. But it doesn't look that way now. You've put a gap between you here and your happiness, which is in the future. It's the "I'll be happy when" syndrome. I don't know man. I mean maybe, you know something I don't. You got a time machine? No. Your desire to be elsewhere is what's killing you because you can't actually leave here. This is it. You're right. This sea brew is delicious. Look, man, I, I don't know if this one night stand thing is for me. I mean, I didn't even have one. Just like the process leading up to it gave me profound anxiety. Yeah. It is very stressful. It might not be for you, honestly. Yeah. I don't think it is. Yeah. It's not like one size fits all, you know. It's all right. But then how do I know what's right for me? Great question. You'll pick up stuff along the way from people. You'll pick up stuff that does work. You'll pick up stuff that doesn't. It's all right. Scrap it. Move on and have compassion for yourself. I get what you're saying, man. Love myself, blah, blah, blah. You know, look, you keep talking about the path and the way. And honestly, man, It just sounds like a bunch of zen bullshit, okay. What's my path? I can't tell you your path. That's why it's your path. Look, man, I just wanted some relationship advice. And now here we are talking about the meaning of life and it's making me very stressed. Yeah. I mean we're both pretty hungover and these cold brews are very intense. It is very strong. Look, I'm not trying to scare you. You're a good guy. You'll figure it out. I guess it's just that I thought my life plan was set and now I don't know anymore. You can only plan so much, Brian. We have no control. Brian, doesn't no Dude, you know, I keep having this dream where I'm in, I'm playing baseball, right? And I'm in the batter's box and the pitcher throws a fast ball right down the middle of the plate. And I swing super hard. Bat's flying over the middle of the plate. And then my arms freeze up the bat right over home. The ball's coming in, it's right about to hit my bat and it stops. And then the ball starts spinning round and round and round the bat. And I move my arms, jerk my shoulders forward and I can't hit it. And I start sweating and I keep trying to move my arms, but nothing's happening. And then I wake up. I've been having that dream since I was eight. Really? Yeah. So like what do you make of that? Maybe we should unpack that next time. Yeah. I gotta go back. Do this push strategy. Whoa, wait, what happened to not being chained to our desks all day? Dude, I'm gonna skip nude in the rain when I'm done with this deck. Do you need any help with that? I would not make you help me with this shit. Come on, man. I literally have nothing to do. Like last week I literally spent two hours in the bathroom stall, looking up JFK conspiracy theories on Reddit. Came back to my desk thinking I'd be in trouble. Nobody noticed, not even Keith. Is it definitely the case that there was a second shooter? Hm-mm, Definitely. Maybe even a third. Really? They think the mafia was involved. Really? Oh wait. No, that was RFK. Who's RFK? JFK's brother. Dude. You know what really grills my zucchinis? 9/11. Oh yeah. That's a good one. Tower seven. What's going on there? Do you know about this? So it doesn't get hit, but it falls. No one died. No one died in 9/11? No it just Tower seven. Oh. Well, wait, one guy did though. Really? Yeah, but it was just old age. Oh - Yeah. It was his time. Yeah, that doesn't count. That's what I'm saying. Look, man, whatever you need help with I am in there. I have nothing to do. Okay. [George] All right. I'm not getting in trouble though. You gotta make sure you finish off Keith and his band to marry men before you help me out. Deal.

Yeah, I, I called the school and they'll allow it for extenuating circumstances. So. But what about Steven? Steven was a mistake. I, I, I don't know what I was thinking. I'm sorry. You, you don't have to explain yourself. No, I mean, he was just there. I don't, I don't know. It's okay. [Amanda] I'm just lost. [Brian] Me too. [Amanda] I dunno what I was thinking. [Brian] It's okay. Don't think [Amanda] You were away. And I was thinking in the future, I was really stupid. - It's okay. [Amanda] I made, made a really stupid decision. [Brian] Yeah. [Amanda] Have you not undressed anybody in a while? [Brian] Can you please not emasculate me right now? [Amanda] I'm not, I'm not. I just, I thought you would've been out on the town having fun. No comment. - Oh. Really? Do I need to get tested? Oh God, no. Nothing past first base. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. [Brian] Yeah. You know. I'm not really into like one night stands, I guess.

One second. What's up Keith? There's something I wanted to talk to you about Brian. Look, I cut off all ties with digital marketing and I've been focused on my work and my work only. And you've been great, which is exactly why we're promoting you to senior analyst. There's a raise component attached to it, but it's conditional. Conditional on what? On tenure. If you can commit to Am era Bank and being in Columbus for three years, there is a 20% raise with your name on it. Wow. Thank you, Keith. I gotta think about it. Yeah. Take your time. And I know you've got a lot going on right now, especially with Amanda coming back into town. Been seeing the activity on, on the gram, Instagram. Do you follow me? I follow Amanda. You haven't accepted my friend request. Give me a little bit of credit. I might might be 32, but technically I'm still a millennial. Uh, yeah. Right, right. Sure. Yeah.

I know it's been a minute, but I started this digital marketing agency. I'm not sure where the time went there at Am era bank. I think I felt like you once, but became me. It was time for a change and you helped me see that. Thanks again. Yeah. I mean, congratulations man. That's, that's awesome. What's go. What's going on over there? Oh, nothing really.

Look, call me back whenever, but before you go, I, I do wanna offer you a job here. You could be my right hand man. George I'm, I'm honored. I, I don't know what to say. Look, I can't offer you some fancy 401k and the salary won't be great, but I can give you some equity and we'll have a hell of a good time. Yeah. There is one catch. What's that? It's in San Fran. California? Yeah. My college buddy works at this DC fund. He got us a little seed money to work with and we have a great client base. You there? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Look, man, it sounds like a great opportunity and you've been such a great mentor and, and friend to me over the last few months, but I just don't know. Think it over man.

I don't know about that. I, I should at least consider it. I mean, you're doing great things at Am era bank. They wanna promote you. I know, but it's boring. Look, take the promotion. Give Am era bank a few years. And then once you've got some experience, you can test the job market waters, just like you planned. But it's in California. You live with Amanda. Use your head. [Monica] Call me when you get to San Fran. Yeah, of course. I, I might have to come there for work. Yeah. Yeah. Just call me. Okay. You want a, a rod? For the road? Oh, I love that. A road rod.

He's here to simply convince you to go with him to San Francisco. Oh. Sorry. San Francisco? What is your dad talking about? Just some job. Okay. Just a job. You didn't tell me about a job in San Francisco. George offered me this position at his start up and it's not a big deal Amanda. Okay. I mean, it's kind of a big deal. It's my company. Look, look, I told George that Brian is not going with him. Whoa, wait, wait, wait, what the hell? You talked to George? He went to my house. Glen! - Dad! Brian, use your head! I, I mean, look at what you've got here. I, I should, I should go. No, no, no. George, George stay Dad, you went to George's house and told him to stay away from me. Are you outta your mind? Honey?
