foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- lt's there. Sir, l'm Commando Ajay speaking. The bomb has been removed. Your daughter is also safe. Being her immediately here by Helicopter. What about those 2 boys? Leave them. Without knowing the reason let's not trouble them. Bring back Sruthi first. This cartoon needs no dialogue. Daddy, where is the button? What? l had kept a button on this paper. l came...took the paper... Shook it & laughed. Father, you're highly irresponsible. Who changed your night shift? Why don't you go to the Police Station. Damn it. Who is bothered if you read the paper or not? Don't simply keep shouting, search. lnterruptions! - Did l shout? Move your legs. Why're you creating hub hub for a small button? Father, it is an important button. Oh! ls it your girl's button? l took this...Shook it.. You can go. Hey, stop the vehicle, stop. l've got all the important buttons from the garbage vehicle. This is it! How did you find out, son? That day she was wearing an orange top. Whatever your girl touches & throws, Even if it is Copper it becomes Gold. ln your girl's blushing face. Even pimples are corals. Even her sweat is holy water. Even your glance at me is my salvation. Music of love... is a wake up call for earth. Even if my love just scribbles. lt'll appear like a poem. Love does not seek cleanliness. Saliva is also holy. Jasmine is Rs.2. But if it falls from your tress it is worth millions. Sweet Candy is Rs.5, But, the half you gave after eating is worth a lakh. Love does not seek auspicious time. Even unauspicious time is lucky. Love needs no swan to carry messages. Even a crow can carry messages. The torch of love never goes off. Love is not afraid of anything. There's nothing silly about this. Nobody understood, this importance. Sky & earth may change. But love will remain stable. The song sung by Adam & Eve will always linger in the breeze. Others may say the word 'Love' is bad but you must say today... Others may call love as a fence of thorns. Today, you should cross it. Since you were out for 2 days at Chidambaram. This small medical test. l'm perfectly normal. Let's conduct this for your father's satisfaction. Give me Vaseline. What're you doing? What kind of a check is this up? Your father has asked me to do a virginity test. Don't shout & create a scene here. Co-operate with them. Who the hell are you to conduct a virginity test on me? Get out of here. You've roamed around with some dogs, without listening to me. How dare you scream now? Look here. You're not any fool's daughter. To behave as your please. You're Kakarla Satyanarayana's daughter. lf someone criticize me or my family. lt is a disgrace for my position. Father, l've not committed any mistake. Why're you trying to embarrass me? l'm human. l'm your daughter. l trust you but not your age. l need to know right away whether you are a virgin or not? There is a point in what your father says. Go ahead and check. To ''Allah Pitchai'' at ''Ginginika Palayam''. Sir, you got only our postal department to fool around isn't it? l've never heard of a place called Ginginika Palayam. You've posted a letter to an existing person in a non-existing place. l did not post this letter at all. Sender's name is Prabhu, Chairman. You are Prabhu, isn't it? -Yes. Hold it. What a way to begin a day? This is Sruti. Are you fine? l'm not fine Prabhu, l'm not fine. l want to meet & speak to you alone. l want to discuss a lot of things. Coming Sunday, my daddy will not be in town. Saying that l have a sports rehearsal... l'll some how reach Nehru stadium. Come inside without the knowledge of others. Please come without fail. Will you marry me, Prabhu? Tell me. Will you marry me? What are you trying to say? Telling a man ''l love you'', Brings lots of happiness to him. l am unable to provide even that happiness to you. Just as if someone is strangling my neck. l am asking you to marry me. But, l've no other alternative. What is it Sruti? What happened? Just because l was with you for a day in Chidambaram. To find out whether l am a virgin, They've conducted a test by a doctor. Henceforth, whenever l come to meet you. They will conduct the test. Why should l stay there? l don't like it. lf this had happened before l had met you. l would have died. Now, l don't even want to die. Okay, l'll marry you but before that you...- No. Right now....here...at this place ...marry me. Sruthi don't be in a hurry. We should not make a decision in haste. Be calm. Be it anger or happiness, haughtiness or tears. Hold it in abeyance for 5 minutes. Your mind will settle down. lt is important now to make a decision in a proper state of mind. Speak after 5 minutes. l'll listen to whatever you say. Hey, leave me...l won't come home. Leave me, l'll never get back to that house. Please listen to me. Leave me, l won't come. Sruthi, come. Leave me; l won't go back to that house. Baskara -What is it uncle? Did you see Prabhu? - No uncle. What happened Kathiresan? why are you out in the rain? My son is missing for the past two days.
