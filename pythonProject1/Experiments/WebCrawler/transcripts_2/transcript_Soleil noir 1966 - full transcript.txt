And call an ambulance. Hello, France-Soir? It was this afternoon at 12.30 that Gaston Rodier was struck down by a heart attack. Professor Lecourtois has been called to his bedside. Gaston Rodier is a famous figure in industry and finance. Born in 1900, with the new century... Your father wants to see you. - I know. You aren't going to get changed? Well? Nothing good, my dear girl. Coronary thrombosis. Hurry, he's waiting for you. Leave us. Get out. Well, daddy, are you sick? No. I'm never sick, my girl. I'm dying, that's all. I wanted to see you alone to tell you about your brother Guy. Tonight, or tomorrow, as soon as I'm dead, all the family, all of them, will want to steal his shares, I know what they're like. Since he won't be here, I want you to defend him. You'll be on your own. Your husband will be no use. Your mother will keep silent, and the others... It will be awful. I thought you were mad, both of you. Yes. And yet... I always loved him. I don't know what sort of man he's become, but... he was talented like few can rival. He was a romantic, not like me. He believed that an error of judgment in politics was unforgivable. And that even if others forgive you, we don't have the right to be forgiven. He decided he was one of the damned... when I could have fixed it all. It was pride. It's idiotic. And now I'm... I'm going to die without seeing him again. You'll defend his interests, eh? Bang their heads together Bang them, but you must prevail. You promise? I swear to you. You shouldn't remain here, my dear. I'm fine here. What did your father want from you? Nothing. Tonight, or tomorrow, as soon as I'm dead, the whole family will want to steal his shares. It will be awful... I think we need to get out of the foundaries. If the general's starting to think... They always ferment social unrest. My husband built up those plants himself. It took over 30 years. It would grieve me to see them leave the family. The family... - Oh, please. I am your lawyer. I'd like to point out to you that if you sell them in haste, you'll get peanuts. Gaston's death has decreased the value of the assets. I'd settle for some pocket money. So you can strum your guitar in Saint-Tropez?... It's better than a harmonium in Saint-Jean-de-Passy. I'm rich but don't have a penny because everything gets reinvested! Dear... - Mother, I'm not your dear, I hardly saw your face before my 16th birthday. Nurses brought me up, they have my tender feelings. You're horrible. Your hatred will destroy you. Frederick, no sermons! Those who want to become a Benedictine opt out of the modern world so they can meditate. You, you'll become a bishop, chamberlain to the Pope and you'll manage the Vatican Bank. A very nice career. Bravo. But don't come on to us like some country priest. I won't dignify that with a response. You all seem to be forgetting a thorny question. To dispose of any of the assets, we need the agreement of all the heirs. We are all here. No. There is your older brother, Guy. You should know that it's been 20 years since that name has been spoken in this house. He's your son. He was angry with his father. A problem arises. Gaston never disinherited him. Is it my fault if he's alive? - I'd rather stick to the facts. In the meantime, he's alive, alive and well, but far away. Moreover, he was sentenced to death in absentia in 1944. But his case would be reversed. He can demand a settling of the score. They'd acquit him? - 20 years later? Definitely. Balivernes! His assets are in theory under sequestration. If we hadn't taken the trouble to transfer his shares to our names, the state would have collected them. Listen, I was the one who defended Guy at his trial. I propose to you an arrangement... discreet, for him too. Gaston's fortune is not only in France. You could compensate him from one of your Swiss accounts. Compensate him for what? For having dragged our name into the mud? He wouldn't have much recourse. He's had a change of identity. He calls himself Fener... Jean Fener. I think Guy could only follow one path, the one that he is on, that of the shadows and oblivion. We are all in agreement. In the end, if this is the opinion of you all, I am not one of the family. Sadly, I think they're right. You are vile. I beg your pardon? When all is said and done, Guy remains my brother, and yours. I wouldn't even recognise him. - Neither would I, but that doesn't change anything. So, not only do you all want to steal from him, but you are dismayed to discover that he is alive. He has been alone in the depths of Africa for 20 years, probably sick, deeply depressed. He's never asked for anything. And yet he scares you. She's crazy. Tell me what he's like, my older brother. Tell me, you who was his friend. Well... You who were, but are no longer. Yes. And you, mummy. You know him well enough, you carried him in your belly. - Oh please. In short, you blame for having the talent, at 22 years old, to write the political chronicle most read in Paris in a collaborationist newspaper owned by the family. If you didn't want him to sell his pen to Fritz, you shouldn't have let them take over! You have a motto: "Victory or death." And yet here you still are, after that great thrashing. So you can shut up! And you who, after having celebrated his 1st communion, came here to bury him alive, you're going to make a collection, no doubt. You were wrong not to wear your cassock, father. We can see your soul now, and it's not a pretty sight. I'm not going to... - Go fuck yourself, general. I should have told you that a long time ago. You have all the faults of the bourgeoisie, and God knows how many there are. But none of the qualities. You are nothing. You are dead. You stink already. But I am very much alive. I'll find Guy wherever he is! My dear, calm down. Shut up. You're just like them. She's upset. It will pass. No. She's her father's daughter. This will not pass. What came over you? I've had enough, enough of it all... of them, of you and of me. You think you'll become someone else if you go into the desert? I hope so. So you've become a believer in exoticism? No. I don't believe in you. What do you blame me for? Nothing. You've been the same-old since adolescence. Then why did you marry me? Because I didn't realise. I was like you all, while daddy was alive: under his wing, protected. But now that he's dead, I've realised I'm just like him. Where has this interest in your brother come from? Until just now, you didn't care about him. That's right. Then it came over you all of a sudden? - Yes. A lifetime of uselessness is a long time. So you want to devote yourself to charitable works? Charitable works? I don't think so... You're tanking the Rodier empire. The in-fighting's started already. I'm going to look for a real man, you're out of your league. And your brother is one? Why not? At least he had the courage of his opinions. Beatrice, this trip is highly dangerous. All the better. The security is stifling here. You've been reading too many novels. Look at yourself in the rearview mirror, you'll see if this is from a novel. You hate me? - No, I myself am waking up. It doesn't seem like it. You're totally impervious. Tombor is a place that few escape: the last refuge of murderers, the survivors of putsches, Nazi torturers fleeing justice. Is this where you want to go? I forbid you to leave. All the same, I'm leaving for Tombor. You want a divorce? - I want to go. And to say that it was just this morning we were a happy couple. You think so? Yes. Ask anyone. I'm not asking anyone, I'm asking you. When is there a plane for Tombor? Not for 5 days. Why's that? Tombor only has one plane a week. Where's your boss? - I am the boss. I want to get to Tombor. I don't take passengers. Is it a question of price? Go fetch me a spark plug. I don't know where it is. I want to go today. Did you see the plane? You want to get in that? Why not? How much will you pay? How much do you want? 200 dollars. If you don't like it, that suits me fine. Okay. We'll think about it. Think about it? We must get going. Try telling that to the plane. It's old. Will it take you long to sort it out? The day. Don't linger in the sun. It's a killer. I like the sun. We aren't in Saint-Tropez. If I paid 100 dollars more, could we leave in an hour? You can try. I'll pay on take-off. Don't you have any trust? - No. You're right. Is this the first time you've been in these parts? Can't you tell? What's a woman like you doing going all alone to Tombor? It's my brother. Are you Rodier's daughter? - Ah, you know. We know everything down here. But nobody cares, because nothing matters anymore. I was a Boeing pilot. I crashed my plane in Dallas. 80 deaths out of 110 passengers. The insurance company blamed me on a technicality. I was finished. So I can carry on flying, here I am. The best thing for you to do would be to sleep. I want to see. There's nothing to see. In a four hour flight, you won't even see a village. Hello? This is Tango. Receiving you loud and clear. Runway clear, except a few goats. Wind, south south-east, light. Understood? Good. Okay. He'll be here shortly. - No contraband? Oh, you are tiresome. Here. What's that? - Folklore. This is my boss, Herr J. He's very elegant. - Only on the outside. Inside, he's the biggest shit in Tombor. Believe me, there's some tough competition. Excuse me, I have to talk to him. You're not alone? No. You mustn't take passengers. She paid me 300 dollars. She doesn't care about your trafficking. She's a billionaire. She's the Rodier girl. No! Fener's sister? You should have said so at once. Introduce me. I already have. Mr. Fener? Seated, at the back. Are you Guy Rodier? No. Are you Jean Fener? Yes. Could I talk to you alone? Gladly. I'll be back. If you want, we could even go to my room. Okay. No, thanks. In this heat, alcohol is death. You wanted to talk to me? Yes, about you. It's a subject of no interest. Your father is dead. I read that somewhere. What? You don't like me? I'm your sister. What kind of bullshit is this? You have a younger brother, Patrick, a sister 20 years younger than you, Beatrice. Beatrice is me. Compliments. Too bad, I fancied you. Incest is not yet something the Rodiers get up to? Listen to me. I thought that my family had completely vomited me out. That is the case, rest assured. Except you, the young sister with the tender heart. The heroine in a work by Anouilh. Be serious for 2 minutes. 2 minutes is a long time. And I've lost the habit. Okay, I'll try. Daddy died 12 days ago. Patrick is a kid, and my husband... You're married? - Yes. Graduate? Inspector of finance. - Indeed. The family are going to rob you and screw up the Rodier empire. That would be a shame. - I've come to get you. For me to sort all that out? - Yes. I'm condemned to death, didn't you know? I spoke to your lawyer. He said that can be sorted out. They'll review your case. And the Frenchmen that I had sent to the Eastern front? Will their cases be reviewed as well? You didn't take any direct political action. It was a crime of opinion. But they're dead all the same. I've seen your file. You were the last Frenchman on the Eastern front in 1944, when Germany was doomed. It was a suicide attempt. You will be acquitted. Finished? It's too late, I'm never coming back. Why? Because I am dead, and it's better this way. [Cursing in Italian] All she has to do is show up and you forget me. Whore! Who are you? What do you want? I'll kill you. Drop it, she's my sister. Kick her out. Kick this whore out. He belongs to me! He belongs to me... You're mine. [Mumbling in Italian.] Kick that bitch out, my love. You see, she needs me. I'm the only one who can love her, and I love her. At 16, she killed her father. Charming. - Mind your tongue. Those who wear Chanel, don't get to judge those who spent 20 years in prison. 20 years. She got out when she was 36. She tried to start over in Italy, in Switzerland, in France. Using false names, obviously. But people always found out in the end, and it all fell apart. So she ended up here, thinking that people here have enough misfortunes not to pass judgment on others. The worst thing is that, even here, they look askance at her. Even killers find parricide beyond the pale. You can't know what it's like to be treated like the plague. Universal reprobation when it happens to you, it's horrible. Now, we'll let her sleep. Still, it was nice of you to come all this way Sorry that it was all for nothing. That remains to be seen. Give my sister something to eat. And no salads. She's a friend. What can I get you? - A drink. May I sit down? Are you going to eat all that? Aren't you sick yet? It'll come. I have malaria, a rotting liver, staphylococci, colibacilli and amoebas. Those must make you fatigued. It saddens me, above all, to know I'm the battleground of these rabid little beasts. You're his sister then? What are you doing here? I speak 10 languages, so... I write the letters for the Germans, the Hungarians, the Japanese... When asked, I write love letters for the native illiterates. But since they don't understand what I've written, even if I was Rimbaud, nobody would know it. Are you going to offer me a drink? - If you insist. I insist. A bottle of your Indian mixture. It makes you blind. You want to die?... - Oh no. I'm not a coward. I sold out people during the war to save my own neck. Disgusting, eh? Yes. You are repugnant. Hot air, Bayard. Bayard? Um yes, I'm called Bayard. That was the only thing I didn't dare mention. I can take... The aeroplane is ready. When do we leave? I'm not leaving. You've spoken to him though. It's not a fleeting conversation that's going to change his mind. I came to get him. I'm going back with him. He no longer exists. That's what you say. - He says it too. You won't leave here. Do you have a room for me? - Yes. Take my luggage there. Are you going to move in here? Yes. But it's a cesspool. - That will change me. I'll put you next to your brother. Thank you. Have you seen the doctor? He's over there. It's further. Shall we continue? Is it a bother to you? - No bother at all. There he is. That's his car. I'll wait for you. He can take me back. - It's your idea. I thought you'd gone back. You really believed that? I don't want to go without having got to know you. Well, have a good look, my pretty. Look at me well. Schweizer. What does he have? I don't know, I'm not a doctor. But on a first look, he's consumptive, malnourished and syphilitic. Please. They aren't like you. They are fatalists. Death doesn't shock them. They know it has to happen. What are you doing to him? It's a concoction made in Brazil. I receive it as contraband. With this, he'll be back on his feet tomorrow. What this won't stop is death a month later. Let's go. Why do you treat these people? To eat. It's not a bad job. No doctor wants to come here. To start off with, I just did cuts and bruises, now I do general medicine. It's working out very nicely. It's a job I don't know. I must have killed many people. I see. You see what? You. It's the best possible position for me here... It may be the only one where I never kill anyone. Note, when I say "never kill", it's in a manner of speaking. You've never killed anyone anywhere. Yes I have. You don't want to come to dinner in a civilised place? No, thanks. For the moment, I've had it up to here with civilisation. I've been looking for you all over! I have a job for you. We'll see about that tomorrow. I've been waiting for you. We didn't have a rendez-vous. - Here, a rendez-vous... Champagne. Do I have to come and see you in such a rancid joint? Rancid? I thought it belonged to you. The one doesn't exclude the other. He also belongs to me. I find him vile, but he's very useful. - Useful for what? Seeking, spying, corrupting... ruling, even. You call this ruling? One cannot always choose one's kingdom. One makes the best of things. You have succeeded in a town where everyone else is washed up? Yes. A house of escape, 3 aeroplanes, 2 cinemas, an ultramodern hotel, 5 cars... And before coming here? Before? I had no luck. Pinched in Brussels for fraud, burnt over real estate in Paris, 8 bankruptcies, 5 years in prison... At least, roughly speaking. And you've had no trouble here? Here, business is more simple. Why keep this rancid place? - Because it's in the shittiest places that the most money can be made. I shock you? I am the daughter of a banker. You know what you need? A man like you. Why not? Since I am not your brother. You're moving a little too fast. I don't mind moving more slowly. But here, seriously, I'm the only one who is still a man. And Eliott. But he's not the boy for you. I'm not here looking for love, but searching for my brother. One doesn't preclude the other. If you had a man in your life, he'd be here. But you are all alone, all alone for dinner. Will you have dinner with me? You're making a mistake. At my hotel, we have dinners like at the Ritz. And then I could tell you some things about your brother that he'll never tell you himself. Really? You have the word of a swindler. It seems we are neighbours. This is the first time in 20 years that we're going to sleep under the same roof. You see, it's all happening. If you want, she can be made to stay. If she stays, after a month, between you, with the climate and the alcohol, she'll be ripe for the taking. You'll have to do nothing more than bend over to pluck her. You might be right. Good job you're useful, otherwise I'd have your guts for garters. Oh yes? Well, as you said, I am very useful. There are many contradictions in what you've said. It was the era for them. During the Occupation, Guy thought, like many people who keep it quiet today, that the greatest peril was Russia. He thought that the Germans would give us 100 years of peace. He was mad. Of course, but in times of war everyone goes mad. How old are you? - 24 years old. You couldn't understand. When I was your age, I was blowing up trains. You were in the Resistance? - Yes, somewhat. I had a bill owing. I didn't wait for the Liberation for the Resistance to pay. Guy, he was on the other side. Wrongly. It was the wrong side. He will always be on the wrong side. It's his nature. You're not sleeping? I've lost everything, even sleep. Sweet dreams. Hi, grass. Hi, quisling. - Finished your memoirs? About how you sold your family to the Gestapo? To sell one's family, it's necessary to have one. I'm an orphan. We are all orphans, old chap. Making money from your love letters? Yes. Here's one I'm finishing for Josee, the little whore of your heart. Her guy is in the slammer. "Oh my love, "life far from you is a welter of dagger blows that I must drink" "drip by drip." How much do you get? Josee pays me in kind. Bastard. I have an idea. A foul idea. The most beautiful woman in Paris is in Tombor. All alone. The third door. There? - Yes, there. She is magnificent. Herr J. wants Rodier's sister all to himself. And you set those scumbags on her. To cause pain. I want to cause pain to Herr J. It's dangerous. Yes, but it's good. The 3rd or the 4th? - I don't know. Is she here, the woman from Paris? No. Next door. If they rape her, she'll leave, and... you won't go back to France. Shut up. Guy? Open up! Guy? Guy, don't go. If you go, you'll leave with her. You going to shut up? Guy? Get out! I was thirsty. You were thirsty... or you were restless? Shit. What are you waiting for to go and see how your sister is? Don't you want to? Come out, you whore! Come on! Come find your brother. He wants to cry. Take him back to his mother. Carry on with that big mouth. and I'll take the plane. Is that what you want? Yes, that's what I want. You think... You think that you're my protector? You think I need you? Because you live with a criminal, you think you're a saint. You think you're a saint? You're just a priest! Yes, you're nothing but an old priest who does his good deed by sleeping with me. I've had enough putting up with your pitying looks. Enough! Go away. I've also had enough of putting up with all this. You're always hanging on to me. I can't even have a minute of solitude. You're always on the verge of drowning yourself, calling for help. Even when you eat, you make it into a tragedy. I'm tired of these tragedies. You know what I want? I want to live with some dumbass, French, rich, cultured, and Catholic! Who'd only heard of despair at the local Odeon. You don't even know what the Odeon is. No. It doesn't matter No, it doesn't matter. I didn't hear what you were saying. I was thinking of you, of us. I love you. - You said I was an old priest. Don't leave me, Guy. Why would I want to leave you, good God. I don't think I ever could. Me, I'm sure. You weren't much help yesterday. You, my girl, I see what you're up to. - Oh yes? You can't fool me, you can't work your way into my life. I can't become your protector or I'll find myself on a plane bound for Paris. Guy, why not do like everyone else and forget? I'm a murderer, and I hate murderers. You'd rather be here than in Paris? Here I have Maria. You love her? - Yes. And two lepers are less unhappy than a leper alone. Time to do the rounds. She hates me. Put yourself in her place. I'm all she has. You who has everything, you want to take me away from her to grow the Rodier pile. If you have a little affection for me, piss off. You're young, healthy, like your father. So go back to France. Here you're not helping me, you're winding me up. Give it, it's for me. The shit? - Inside. Say, they tell me you acted like a flying madman around Gomez's. So what? You threw a message to Guy's sister. So what? Regarding Beatrice... drop it. Why? - Because I say so. What do you say? - She's not for you. You mean to say she's for you? Yes! I've never gotten involved in your business. So you do the same and leave me in peace. You've not understood me properly. That girl turns me on and I want her. You see, Herr J., me who doesn't care about anything, me that never wanted anything, hearing you speak, I've realised something: I want something. This girl? - No. I want you to leave her be. Say, are you forgetting that it's my plane you fly? What about you? Are you forgetting that you lack pilots to do what you want done? Can I help? - You keep out of this. Shall I take him down a peg or two? Yes. But don't brag about it. If you say it, you have to do it. You only have 2 pilots in condition to fly. Shortly, you'll just have one. Well, I believe you've won. Only, watch out. You won't win every time. Looks like you might have made a friend. Deutschland uber alles. You came?... One can't refuse an invitation made in this way. A battle? I've had words with Herr J's killer. Hermann is a killer? Among others. Here it can be useful. What caused this fight? Politics. Would you do something to make me happy? I can try. Tomorrow morning, we both take the plane back, and then I leave you where I found you. Not yet. I want to try something. Herr J. is a dangerous sort to mess about with. Exactly, that's what I'll be counting on. But it's Guy that will have to come save me, not you. Don't ask this of me. Not of me. Why? Because you love me? No. Because you're driving me up the wall. Since you've been here, my life's not the same. It's the same thing. So let me do this. Don't worry, the Rodiers are not in the habit of losing. Serve me another. Sorry, gentlemen, but I must retire. Look after this for me, I don't have any pockets. Can I offer you a drink? A whiskey. You love her? I think you're in love with her, no? What about you? Leaving as she is, which one of us will get her first? I'm not a customer. Are you disappointed? You don't want her anymore, she disgusts you? She turns me on. How about you? Then, it's that you don't want to? What you want, it's that I don't have her. However, this afternoon... I've changed my mind. Why? - She's not for me. You for real? You know, this spectacle she's making, it's to stir her little brother. But the little brother knows her game and will not be stirred. Result: she's going to come a cropper, and happily here I am. Happily. Wait for me, I'll be there. You're not staying? - No, it's too early. Time is on my side, and time is not something you can rush. You want to be my sister? The mother I never had? My mistress perhaps? Why? Why? Aren't you finished yet? Approach, renegade, and prostrate yourself. Grind your forehead into the dust and thank the gods. We are no longer alone, old chap. We are no longer alone. One more devotee in the belly of oblivion. An additional recruit. She's staying with us. She's staying with us, old chap. What will you do here? I'm staying. What are you doing? I'm learning cruelty. You seem to be getting the knack. And your programme for today? Get to know the country better. Well, my little orchid, I'm the guide you need. Bastard car. Trouble? This piece-of-shit car! Come. You love Beatrice, eh? It pisses you off that she goes with Herr J. How about you? It makes me laugh. You like a good laugh, eh? Here you are. Oh, I'm coming with you, my dear. I have to go to town. A meeting. I'd forgotten. You're not going to leave us here. I like a good laugh too. You pig! No worries coming with me? I'll tell you later. Have you seen Guy? He's left to do his rounds. I think he'll be back very late. Tell him that I've moved into town. At mine. Don't forget. You can count on me there. He's going to have a nice night, Herr J. You're jealous, eh? I'd be surprised if you weren't jealous. You've lost your dancer. Herr J. has whisked her off. Yes. It's no great surprise But I thought I'd be the one to do it. When he's had his fill, he'll pass her on to you. What's come over you? There's no ashtray. Bastard. Well? What are we waiting for? If you're some sort of pervert, if you need me to put on a bodice, boots, or a mask, you'll have to supply them. Don't play too much with fire. What fire? You want me to tell you something? You're a small-time adventurer. When your scams don't work out, you'll join a training scheme in a protestant bank. I have connections. I can give you a leg-up. But I warn you: it will be admittance by the tradesman's entrance only. Will you follow me to my room? I'll beat you to it. Where's the doctor? - There. Get lost, you sod. Rodier, you're disgusting. She came for you, and you don't give a fuck. You're leaving her in the arms of Herr J., so you can remain faithful to this character you've created. You won't even lift your little finger. However, you know what Herr J. will do to her. You know, eh? Bastard! And if she blows her brains out afterwards, what will you do, eh? You who don't want to be responsible for the unhappiness of others. Let's see, would could put you at your ease? Soft music? Tell me, on your battlefield, has it been long since an armistice? At bottom, perhaps under your terrible front... there's nobody. All the same! Bitch. Here you can scream, go on. Nobody will come. In my bedroom, girls have been known to scream all night. Nobody will be alarmed. Don't try anything stupid, Rodier. It's good you came. Come on, we're both leaving. Go on. Buy me a drink, and I'll give you a tip-off. That. Very nice of you. I'm going to tell you something: Beatrice is with Guy. She's going to win. She'll take him back to France, and you'll be finished, terminato. What? You know very well: Rodier in Paris with his sister, and you here in your cesspool, alone. No. No. No! No! Remember, you'll always have your uncle Bayard. You have evil in your blood. Not in my blood, I have it in my flesh, in my bones. I am a big abcess that matures slowly. Maria... My little girl. Bambina, don't cry. There might be a solution to your woes. I like seeing men cry, but I can't stand it with women. To make Guy stay with you, leave it all to me. Only, we must get rid of the sister. Once the sister... Guy will stay. Capito? We'll tell the poor people that the wicked Beatrice wants to take away the good doctor. And that afterwards they will die, without help, without care, without dressings, without anything. I can see you catch my drift. Only, you must help me. They must be got drunk. Sober, they're not so bad. So, you'll grab the key to the wine cellar, I'll wait for you in front of the shed in the truck, and we'll go to their village to spread the good word. Capito? Thank you. Hey. I'm more than happy to help lovers, but it needs... But I have nothing. That's not enough, "nothing". - What about this? - This is from my mother. No! Who kills their father and still loves their mother? Bastard. Bastard. Big kids. There's one left. Let's go. What if I crack up, once in France? You won't crack up, I'll be there. Alcohol isn't going to help. And Maria, how to explain it to her? You want me to do it? - No. This is up to me. Leaving will kill her. And staying is to die with her. It's useless and idiotic. Perhaps that would be the brave thing to do. The brave thing is to live, fool. Doctor! The population of the village is down below. They've gone crazy. Get out! Get out! The problem is resolved. Come. Why? - I'll explain later. What's going on? - They've got them drunk. They've gone totally crazy. What do they want? - Your neck. Aren't the police going to step in? - Here, the police act afterwards. I should have got rid of you a long time ago. Don't do this. Please. If you tell me the truth, you might stand a chance. I swear I'll tell you. Just the real truth. If I still lie, out of habit, beat me, but don't kill me. Why do you want Beatrice's neck? Well? Because she's young and beautiful and I'm old and ugly. And because she would have ended up sleeping with all of you except me. I see. Get in there. Why? It's where you belong. Not at all. - Go on. What are you going to do, Herr J.? Shut up. I'm doing a good deed. Was that you shooting? At a rat. What are you doing? Finishing the letter. The situation is vacant, no? The pilot came. When he understood, he went off like a lunatic. Where to? He didn't say. Those weapons belong to me. I thought there was a track. There was one. What do we do? - I won't let them kill you. If the taxi doesn't seize up, soon we'll be over the border, and we're safe. Does your flying coffin have anything to drink? Is there something up with the engine? - It's not the engine, it's Herr J. He wants us to go back. - Fuck him. They're armed. - Then we have to go back. Never. We're armed as well. Listen, Beatrice... - Fuck it! Steady. It's not every day we recreate '14-18. Wounded? Not badly. We got them! - Hang on. What's up? - A bullet hit the fuel tank. You don't shoot? Hermann is kaput. I thought I was a goner as well. It's not worked out well, our thing. We're all in the same boat. Condemned to die of thirst. Can I put my hands down? You're not shooting either? That's nice. I wouldn't waste a bullet on you. No weapons. My emergency shovel is under the seat. Dig. What's the point? To lose weight. Under the wheels, from behind. We're going to fix the aeroplane. There's still some gas? You were sitting on it. You almost had a hot backside. Shit. We can't take-off again? No. In short, this is the end. Pity. Unless... Say, I never could change a spare tire... There. Isn't that a job well done? Yes. Now, you have to push. Let's see if you're remain so excited. So, do you want to go? Do you want to let Maria die? Without you, she's fucked. Truly, you will have betrayed everyone right up to the end. Scumbag! - Cut it out! You both need each other, you arseholes. Go! Well? You were right. Guy is on the wrong side again. Only this time, you're the same as him. We'll have to take the chance that we're spotted. By a plane? There's one a week. But nomads could come any day. Can we spare a little gas? Given where we've reached... Say, you care about living, all of a sudden. Yes. I want to live long enough to see you croak. Eliott! You see? She said Eliott. That bothers you? Clear off. Leave me alone. You're not going to abandon me now? I've killed a man, nonetheless. A bastard, but a man. I love you, but fuck off out of here. Why are you doing this to me? Because I can do no other. I can't give up on someone who'd be made so wretched. It's stronger than me. I need to go back to Maria. You're abandoning me too. It's not the same with you. You'll be sad, but you won't despair. You have everything. And most of all, you have him now. You won't have come all this way for nothing. You've found a man. It's rare, you know. Look after him. Never change. You're good, you know. And after all this, it's going to be less hard for me. Things won't be the same. The plague has lifted since you came. Ciao. So, do we cross this frontier? If you like. And then? Where do you want to go? It doesn't matter. Anywhere or where you are. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
