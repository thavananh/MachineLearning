foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Moved right through here. We all spooked and so they were leaving right away that's too bad. You know as well as I do that they have nothing to fear from bears if they properly store their food and lock in bear boxes right. You know what I don't get? It's their description. I mean black bears don't get that big. What they described was more like a Volkswagen size than a bear. Only Alaskan brown bears get that big and there have been no grizzlies in the states since nineteen twenty nine. Long time ago. Maybe it was a prank. Remember the guy with the big-foot outfit? Rolly almost shot him? Or maybe old sasquatch is back for another round of scaring the tourists. Eh? Whatever happens. If you see him, don't get all trigger happy. That outfit was amazing. I think he actually used bear skin from that freak show they closed back in Chicago. Confiscated that so unless he made another one did you? I don't think its the same guy. Hey wait right there! Park rangers! Whatever it is. It's quick! Man. We're gonna be at this all night long. I think it's the same old boy with a new costume. I say we come back tomorrow. We tomorrow. We'll track him to the site, we'll confiscate the suit and we'll just give him a citation. Sounds good to mo it's at least two miles back to the patrol car let's go. Hey hold it right there. Look at him! Sir. Are you lost? Are you all right? The man! You guys have to run now! You have to follow me! Follow me! Follow me! Where we going? [Growling] Oh no not again! [At pink Princess.

Oh dear... Sammy are you OK? Yeah. Tori. Come on! I'm documentary filmmaker Thad Marr. We are here at the behest of the department of the exterior to document the diverse group of tourists who are visiting the park for the reprising of the historic and famous firefall it was discontinued in the park in nineteen sixty nine due to changes in department of exterior policy stopping supposedly unnatural events. The park management has been made aware that the people who saw this amazing event originally performed for over a hundred years are getting old. And dying. To honor the support of the park. The famous firefall a dropping of flaming embers off iceberg point. Will be done one more time for all who want to come see this Friday night. Our film crew has been randomly pulling vehicles out of line and will assign five film crews to them. Our cameras will follow these groups for the next few days up until the firefall. Each group will also be given their own video camera so they can record their own films and images for everyone to see from their own eyes. And we will also enlist award winning photographer David ashcraft to prowl the park and get magnificent still shots of our selected guests. Hi David. Hi Thad. I'm gonna get some great shots out here. It wait. Photo op! Great, here is our first group! Wait. Photo op! Great, here is our first group! Okay... We are the bird family from Wisconsin I'm fay and my husband frank is an insurance adjuster. I... we decided to travel out here to see what is called the most amazing park in the world. This is my husband frank. And our wonderful daughter Tori. And our son Jason. Who we just call Jay bird. Sure is pretty here. Beautiful... and we... Quiet! Wow you chose us. That is so spiffy. My name's Hugo Armstrong, this is my wife dora. And we are ready to challenge this place. I mean it could be dangerous here. Boulders could fall on you. The rapids are world famous, and hear there are wolverines. Mountain lions, and big dangerous bears. You know dora and I have been in some amazing places you might recognize me. I was mister buff pump up three years running. You know mister buff pump up? World welter weight body building champion? I had a song and everything well. That was before my injury... What frank is trying to say is that we're going to enjoy camping here at the park. I guess... Shut up! Hi. I'm Stanford James, I'm from San Francisco you've probably seen me on TV. I am.. I've been an outdoor TV show host. I'm here in the park to film my back outdoor skills with the help of my nephew Sammy Stuart. My sister's son. From Bakersfield. His father ran away with the secretary. They're in Tahiti. They've been gone for years. Anyways... you've probably heard of my bestselling book. Survival and camping book, called the unabridged guide to the outdoors. UGO - it's in my TV show. It It's my motto. You probably know it, you go out there! UGO! You go out there! You've heard it! I'm Robert MacDonald but you can call me brick this bonny laddy. My climbing partner Angus Gordon. We're the free climbing champions for the highlands of Scotland. We'll be taking a boatload of of pictures for you with the camera you lent us. The kids are going to enjoy biking and hiking and taking pictures and climbing and relaxing oh. We heard that they are going to redo the firefill one more time for the last time. And that's really neat too. We never seen that except for pictures from the nineteen fifties. That'll be sick. Fire falling from a seven thousand feet cliff. Flames shooting all over the place. Possible death. Possible destruction awesome! Reminds me of my video game attack of the galactic artini woman vampire zoid you little kidster sorry about frank. He's not a big talker sorry. Dear? Do you have anything to say? Tori? As you can see. I. We have brought all the fun things you could think of for camping right frank? Frank! Yes dear. If you saw me on my cable show. Big outdoor survival. I want let you know something. I can track. Let's get something straight. Those escargot crazy frenchies. They're rude. All right. Who puts exercise and cooking in a show together anyway? I don't understand... Uncle Stanford. Relax. But I can still do it all. Can't I dora? I used to put Arnold in his place, didn't I? I can't wait to get down in that glacially carved valley. Almost as carved as I used to be. Huh dora? And that firefall being redone. That could be amazing. I might have to use my speed and agility to dodge all those falling embers and flames. Joe. The best advice I could possibly give you is always have two handcuffs. There could be multiple suspects around, you never know and... we have to do this too? You rolling? Oh. OK. I'm head ranger Jeff Fauntleroy you can call me Raldy. To my left here is ranger spud Washington we're law enforcement rangers. The department of the exterior. I graduated first in my class from Quantico. I been here at the park for twelve years. And we are completely dedicated to maximum excellence in the protection of this wonderful environmental treasure from the polluting hand of irresponsible human beings spud? I think most of the people are here to see the beauty of the park Raldy you know soldier. You're absolutely right. Except for the fact they're not! We be planting our mark here and all the mountains. And we're going to break all the climbing speed records. We aren't using ropers ney ropes. Aye? Ney ropes aye! Ney ropes. Aye! Aye for Scotland for Scotland! Ooh. I wanna see the animals, warm and cuddly, donâ€™t you I want to see the pretty waterfalls. In fact they pollute. Drop trash and even even urinate on the soil near the trees. Well. Hi, I'm ranger spud Washington, but you can call me spud. I been working here at the park for about five days I just transferred here from green mesa national park after the last eight rangers they sent here disappeared without a trace. There is an investigation. No we're really looking for them. But it's really a mystery. I used to fire up all those body building fans. Didn't I dora? Ppoh honey, I don't think... Falling flames. Rapids, huge boulders, big rocks to climb, danger animals! Big things. Big things. This is my kind of place. My kid of place see. I'm gonna teach Sammy in the way of nature it's not a true native child of the forest. Like I am, isn't that right Sammy? No one is. Because I am! Just startled me. I mean. It was right there. You guys can cut that right? You can edit around that? That really scared me. I can do it again. I can do it again. I do love nature. I do. Let me. Okay. Lets do another take. The two new female rangers behind are rangers so krochnibler. And ranger Cecelia Studebaker what? But I really am excited to be working here at the park! Get out of the car! Get out! Come on. I'm taking you into custody of park ordinance putting toxic illegal waste rolly that spray was on the windshield. As a result of the motion. Thrusted over the rental windscreen that's should be its appropriate target. And on the vital habitat of spotted marching pumpkin bug? It's breeding season for the little creature. Hey dudes. Psst. Whatcha filming? You filming a movie? Wow dude. Hey. I think you should know I was a pretty big singing star back in the days of peace and love. I'm Sid. Sid Sapperstein? You know. Indian love song. Well... Until the man closed down my gig. It was the man. The man! Well. He's not gonna get me now. I been here for.. I... I don't know. But anyway, he closed down my gig dude. Hey dude. That just ainâ€™t right. It's the ghost! The man! Get after him Raldy? [Heavy breathing] Where in the world could he have disappeared to? I was right on his tail as we went up that draw. There aren't any easy holds on the face of that cliff. Oh god. What are all these stinky little paper bags? On the base of the rock? Those? Those are bomb bags. When climbers been on the wall for two or three days. And need to defecate, they do it in bomb bags. They shout bomb bag! And toss it down. That's why you don't want to be anywhere near that cliff face. So these are all poop? They throw them down. Hopefully in an area which we arenâ€™t standing. Climbers are usually a thoughtful group. But sometimes they aim anywhere near to the rock. Notice how far away I'm standing. Look out below laddies og hdo sorry! Crap. ;Et let's go get you changed are you going to use all of this in your movie? Oh just some? Oh. You may cut what I say? Oh. Is this my good side? I love my RV. I think Arnold has one just like it. But you know it's got all the storage for the things that are important like the weights. And the bench, and the bikes and the raft, and everything to just do big things here. You know. When I was mister buff pump up, I did a photo shoot for pump me up magazine in a woods just about like this. I was back east and there weren't quite as many big trees as there are here and not near as much danger but I really worked that camera with my immaculate flexing. Big things. I'm going to be able to do big things here. Tomorrow. I'm gonna ride up to reflection lake. They say that climb is a thousand feet in less than a mile. Piece of cake. Dora. Remind me to shoot those rapids sometime before I leave. OK dear. Big things. This is gonna be great. Things sure are easier here than at home. Birds. Like us. Are everywhere. I saw this cute little point here and his girlfriend in the Meadow on the way in what they were doing. I had to grab little jaybird's head and turn it. I'm glad Tori wasn't watching. Cause, she's so innocent I think I'll pump dora!!! Ah. That was good. Big things! Some people say. That uh food tastes better in the out of doors due to perkier taste buds. Uh, from the, the fresh air. Cleaning out your sinuses and nasal openings. I think I smell better than at home. I think my sniftier is niftier ha! I made a funny! I think. Toasted hot dogs will be simply scrumptious for dinner, couldnâ€™t you I am so excited to stay at the Awachoochie hotel this was early days of the park. This is so cool. Exquisite architectural masterpiece. Oh. For survival for someone to save their energy for said survival. Cause... When you go out there. You'd better be well rested. That's what I'm talking about. I can't wait to study all the edible parts of the hotel's walls furniture. Floors no. We're not gonna eat the hotel, Sammy come on. You gotta think. No. No, we're gonna do it after dinner. Study all the edible plants that have the chemical qualities that makes things like flairs. And medical compresses I mean that's important stuff. Sammy, and my backpack is very well equipped they're on the roof. They're on the roof. How'd they get up there? Get off the bloody roof. Come on lets go. For Scotland! These hotel walls were too tempting and get their knickers in a twist. Let's get a wee breakfast free climb. You could be sure we ne'er be climbing any more halls made by the hands of man. At least not on this trip nay halls. Eye? Just walls. Aye! For Scotland! Park rangers fall in! Attention! Washington. Crochnabler, Studebaker, new park recruits you were chosen from the common masses as elite soldiers. Warriors in the ongoing battle to protect the park. The shock troops a company of Valiant souls who are on the front lines save a squirrel protect the porcupine. Defend the deer and guard the grasses. Never rest never stop. Never quite. We never. Never compromise and never. Never surrender. Yes sir! We got everything for the fire. Right we got all the wood, so it's gonna be a really big fire I think the guests are really gonna like it. Hey look at that ranger's name! No way. Hey krochnibbler! Long o. Long I it's German. You get it right! Snap out of it. I'm so sorry! Somebody a little sensitive? Seriously? Lets get out of here that's real mature. I hope your mom's proud Zoe. Iâ€™m so sorry, it's not that big of a deal. Come on honey you're better than them. A pretty girl I don't like my name. I know but nobody likes their name. I'm named after a car. I love you. So let me guess ranger Washington. The girls set the fire? Looks that way. You know I will be glad when we can make wood artificially from washed up seaweed that way. It can decompose naturally on the forest floor and become for our little insect friends. He Raldy. What's that on your belt, that's not standard issue, is it? Thatâ€™s nothing. Come on. If we're gonna be partners. You gotta be able to trust me. Right? Well. It's just a broken compass. My grandfather gave it to me just before he passed away he called it his compass of destiny. He swore that it led him to meet my grandmother. He said one day it would do the same for me. But as you can see there's no ring on my finger yet. That's really neat. You're lucky to have an heirloom from your grandfather so what. Is the needle just broken. Yeah. Maybe I'll fix it someday. I couldn't help overhearing about your compass. Don't ever give up hope, sir you never know what joy the future may bring... The presentation... And its rolly. Not sir. Okay rolly... Come on. Let's get up front I hear they talk about wild animals. I don't care. Now Tori dear... come on frank. Don't dawdle. Yes dear. Hi. We're from Wisconsin. Hey dora. Let's sit here front and center I bet they're gonna talk about big dangerous things we can do her eat the park okay. Sweetie. Look, I brought your big fluffy coat, it might be getting cold later this evening. Are you kidding me dora. I still have magnificent circulation. My body core heats up like a furnace. I just don't get cold. Remember that shoot we did up in Alaska for pump me up magazine? Not all of me was shriveled. Hey Sammy. I bet they started that campfire with scaping magnesium powder and a cotton fluff tender application to the sparked embers. I bet you're right uncle Sanford I know I am. Chapter six. Woah. You're right chapter six in my book. Good job buddy. Welcome to the park in the park you can call me Roldy. Baldy? No. Ballsy! Rolly's an R. I'm the head ranger for law enforcement and environment protection here at the park here's my new partner. Spud Washingtonpphi folks, glad you came it's so great to see so many... You're sitting in the camp amphitheater in the central Meadow area between the eight thousand foot height of crome dome. The two thousand falls. And the seven thousand foot tall iceberg point. The park has over three million visitors each year. With three thousand two hundred crimes committed and an average of six hundred and twenty visitors incarcerated... What ranger is telling you is this is a beautiful place where loads of our loads of our friends come to visit and get back to the wonders of nature. Just smell that fresh pine scent in the air we have a pioneer history center and native American houses called umachas. Oh and the animals here... Mountain lions. Skunk, mosquitoes, poison snakes. Sucking ticks, and even some very large dangerous bears. Wow. Mom, dad, bears! Large bears dora! Dangerous bears! Yes! I know about bears. Chapter one sixty four in my book chapter one sixty five. Uncle. Chapter one sixty five. That's right. How to use sound and movement to hypnotize an angry bear chapter one sixty five. You can buy my book. Unabridged guide to the outdoors everybody it's really good. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you appreciate that. In fact. We've got a ghost story, a mystery in the park oh dude! Here we go again. It's the man! It's the man. Gotcha! Nine years ago one of our law enforcement ranges traveling found a hideous crime on the valley floor it was an illegal squirrel feeding he was driving so fast he accidentally hit a large bear cub. With the bumper of his patrol vehicle. That ranger said he felt the bump. But thought something was wrong his car motor, continued on to the place where the squirrel feeding crime was being committed. The bear was evidently struck hard enough by standers said the bumper tore off the whole side of his face. Those who have been in the clutches of the bear. Few, proud still bear his mark but the bear. He did not die, he grew into a huge two thousand five hundred pound bear that lurks in the shadows of cliffs and he is seen on rare occasions but has never been able to be followed by wildlife or ranger personnel somehow. He just disappears every time he's tracked. Some of our law enforcement rangers and visitors of the last years disappear without a trace some were hiking. Some were in their cars, and some... Were drug from their tents while peacefully sleeping some say the cause of these disappearances may be the same huge rogue bear a giant. Frighteningly angry disfigured mutant bear and we call him and we call him fuzzy wuzzy fuzzy wuzzy! But that was a story folks. Don't be afraid. As for the rules and regulations there's no use of chainsaws or cut wood. No walking in the meadows, no biking in the meadows no feeding the deer. Birds, squirrels, foxes, weasels, no petting skinks. Skunks snakes and drakes what is these. Little fairy oh.. You're a big fairy. Oh you're a big fairy. Oh yeah you're a big big fairy oh. Hi oh. I'm on fire! I'm on fire! Angus. Fire, shelaliegh! Aye shelalieh! Oh no! Stop. Drop and roll, uncle! Stop drop and roll! I can't roll! Really sold out of all your other packs? Sorry. Sir, the firefall crowd we were rushed and everything was sold. I'm surprised we have anything left at all. We sold the last little boys' happy furry chipmunk pack before you came. And all we have left is the pretty pink Princess. Kinda interesting. Says things when anyone whistles all right. Um. I'll take one. I'll take one of those. I can make it work I know it's pink. But I can make it work. I'm Stanford James. I'll be fine uncle Stanford. It'll get dirty while we're out there surviving my pack can hold most of the things we need. Remember chapter thirteen? Pack light but compete. Yeah. Chapter thirteen right. All right buddy. Let's go. Look at that pwetty pink pwincess. Isn't so cutsie wootsie. [Doll] I'm pretty. I'm pink, I'm the pretty Princess look at the loser that's wearing me! Let's just go back to the hotel and pack for our hike. Where are the batteries on this thing hey. Check out those guys climb they're in kilts. Wait a minute [growling] And so. We see that the glaciers' steady carving the valley floor in a special u shaped. Stones and boulders scored the valley floor that we see today. Pphey on that big glacier... Frank! You're interrupting the ranger it's OK I don't mind so I was wondering is this the first time the glaciers have moved through he valley? Mom! Tori... Do they know where they're going? Are you OK honey? Is everything all right? No. I'm not OK. I'm sick. I am completely fed up. You sick? I hate mom. And I hate you too for letting her be the way she is. The way she is... I can't tell her how to behave. She walks all over you. Every day. You never stand up to her. The more you give in. The more she dominates her. You have to stand up to her. We always do what she wants. We go where she wants to go. We see what she wants to see. We even eat what she wants to eat. You're such. An milquetoast. I don't like confrontation. My parents. Your grandparents they fought all the time when I was a child and it hurt me really badly and I never wanted you and your brother have to see the same things that I had to see I'm sorry. You are sorry you'll always be sorry. I hate that you're sorry. Well. Maybe I'll was wrong about a lot of things but we're gonna go back and join everyone else cause we're still gonna try to get the top of crome dome after lunch. OK. Come on. Let's go woah dude are you making movie too? Wow. What's it about? Oh. A documentary. Hey... Do it on me. Dude. I've been there man I been there. You remember when Bob Dylan started a concert with an electric guitar? That was my I never got that back. But I was down in Hollywood at capitola records. And Elvis was gonna jump up and down on stage. I told the colonel, dude, have him shake his hips. Man. The chicks dig that. And Jim Morrison. He was gonna name his band the windows. I said Jim, what are all the entrances in life? The important passageways. Doors. Dude! Doors! And when I was in England eating breakfast in Liverpool. I told the busboy, an get that band put together. And later Paul told me he George and John to play. And finally they got Richard to drum. That kid Starkey. He was a great drummer, a real star wonder if they ever made it. Oh me.\? After managing thirty four bands I got this gig playing the Indian love song her in the park during the firefall. Great gig. Steady gig. Show every night for years. Then the man closed it down. The man closed down the gig. Dude. It was the man. You have to Stand up to the man I just... I just really enjoy seeing all the people experience the park. The nature. The geology. The history, it makes me so happy. That's my favorite part of the job. Really makes me feel good to see the guests enjoy the amazing scenery. And the beautiful waterfalls. Its the best. So. Spud, I hear that you're originally from the area? Yeah. I was raised in Fresno, I went to Clovis high school I really liked science in school. But I guess I just always really loved animals oh I love animals too! Back home we used to have horses. And dogs and cats, and I even had a pet goat. His name was Brutus. Me too. His name was Billy. Yeah. I had to kick him once, because he tried to butt me. He never tried that one again. Silly goat. [Radio] Meet me at reflection creek. There's a Scottish flag flying off the cliff there. I'll drop you off spud. I really enjoyed our little chat. It's kinda scary how much we have in common. But I like it. You're very nice. I think you're really nice too Cecilia. Well dora. Ready to do big things? I hear that ride up to reflection lake is world class climb. And we're gonna be right under crome dome. Did you remember to hydrate well. Like I reminded you this morning? You bet I did. My body is coiled and ready to spring up that canyon like the wind. I feel like a Bengal tiger. Say. Did ya pack any snack we can have at the top? Maybe some of the goop? I love that goop. It's gorp. Honey. And yes, I brought the kind that you love with the candy o the top. Great. Back when I was mister buff pump up I did a photo shoot with Britta Hilgendorfer she was miss European buff pump up. They put us on a bicycle built for two. And it was great. You should have seen the muscles on display that day. But of course that was before I met dora. And I really didn't like Britta that way. She was. She was nice and all. But she never shaved her pits, and she had a real low voice uh... I never could figure that out. I thought it was because she was east German. Honey.

I believe it. So on the way over I saw raldy and spud heading over to the office again. No another uniform change? Yeah. A tourist on a bike ran raldy off the bridge and he fell in the creek I know I pulled him out. When I held his hand, I felt something yeah. Something wet! Oh no. Please tell me it wasn't from the bomb bags, that's so gross. No. I mean... I felt something... Oh that something! Yeah. He looked into my eyes and oh. I know he felt it too. It was kinda cute he got all shy and turned red. OK. So. I got a confession OK. I kinda like spud. Really. He's so friendly. Most guys make fun of me for the way I talk or ignore me completely. But spud he cares I mean at least about me as a person. Not just a professional that he works with like. To him I count. And we have a lot in common. That is so great. Spud is such a nice guy yeah. He is. I just wish he felt something for me the way raldy feels it for you. You really think raldy feels something for me? You don't think I'm just imagining it? No I seen the way he looks at you. He did a double take at you at the fire last night. He double took. Okay that it good. Okay. Let's put these flags back to the station. [Growling] Oh you know what else? Raldy doesn look half bad with his shirt off. So as you can see. Some plants are edible and can be used for outdoor survival chapter seventy two of my book chapter eighty two. Uncle. Remember. See, I'm still not sure that's a skunk cabbage. This is. It kinda looks like a bladderwort. It is a skunk cabbage if it was bladderwort. I would have diarrhea already, and I feel fine. Okay. I'll remember that. It's important to know what you can eat, where you're going. And if you're in any danger in the area when you're hiking. Very important take that hiker for instance right there. He may be someone you want to watch out for. He's someone that may be a threat if provoked. Kinda like some wild animals [hey big boy] Keep walking who keeps talking to me?

I appreciate that. I think it comes down to the great training you provided me. I agree. Well said. Well. As you know, I graduated first in class at Quantico and I know a thing or two about a thing or two. Ever tell you a story about me or actually it was two guys... Ranger. A cougar jumped us on the trail. Stanford James and Sammy steward were chased up to the top of park falls I don't know if they made it or fell off. I heard one of them yell in pain, they need help! Don't worry. We'll handle it. Go get out of the rain. Go! Ranger krochnibler we have a code forty nine atop park falls. Code three drop our duty weapons. And putting on our rescue gear.

All these years I tried so hard to be understanding and to listen to you but you got worse and worse. Well that's all over. You got it? You got it? I got it. All right kids. Let's go now! It's good to see you're awake Sammy. You've been asleep for almost two hours. How bad is my leg? Well. It's a bad sprain, there's no broken bones. But you're not gonna be walking without crutches for at least a week how we gonna get off this mountain. Though? I figure the camera crew is already down there so they know we're up here. And on the way here. I saw some fireberries. Above the cave on the hill. That means I can go up there and make some flares with those. Remember chapter two twenty seven? Yeah. I gotta tell you something. Sammy I lost my show. I. Um I'm unemployed. I didn't come here to take my research to heart. Or to any wildlife I'm not an outdoors-man. You're more of an outdoors-man than I am. What I know. I read in your book, uncle. You are a great outdoors-man. You really are. I wanna be. I'm gonna be. I've been reading my book. I'm gonna learn it front to back. I'm gonna know it all love you Sammy. You're like a son to me. There's no one else I'd rather do this with but you. I love you too. Uncle. Sammy. When I get my show back and I am gonna get my show back. I want you to do it with me. I want you to be there with me. Cause who knows my book better than you? All right. I'm gonna go up there and get those flares made. And I'm gonna get them up here. We're gonna get out of this OK don't worry. One more thing I want you to remember. Go out there! OK. I'll see ya [growling] Sammy. I presume. Are you all right? Where is Stanford James? Probable sprain. I think he'll be back in a minute raldy. Look around this cave, this is where the missing ranges were taken. Look at that do you think it belong to the ghost? The ghost of fuzzy fuzzy raldy! See that face before? Grab the boy and run! We're near the top of the park falls! There's a ledge out here! Come on out! Come on you monster! Do or die. Back fuzzy! You monster. Let's see what you've got!

Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair fuzzy wuzzy wasn't fuzzy was he? Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear. Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair on the side of his face! Uncle. No! [I'm pink. I'm the pretty pink Princess] Chapter one sixty one! Roots! You used the roots to hang on after you went over the edge. Chapter one sixty one! Uncle you are so smart now. How'd you know about the roots? You were never near the edge that's true. But I knew that there were bomb bags at the base of small ironwood tree. I knew that the roots would go out all along long and stringy because of the unnatural fertilizer at the bottom of this so in effect. We were all saved by bomb bags that's pretty cool. Spud! Raldy! [Frank!} do you see that? That's so awesome yeah. Raldy? This is for you. You dropped it when you were knocked off the bridge near crome dome yesterday you found my compass? Thank you Zoe.
