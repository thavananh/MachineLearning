Morning. Cookie? Just cereal, thanks. Alright, here you go. Do you ever sleep, grandma? When I was young. Social media, Grandma. Oh, you and your social media. Better get him in the shot. Good morning. Good morning. Now what sounds better: "Nice to meet you, sir." or "welcome to Snow Falls, sir." When I was mayor, it was first names and a strong handshake. 'kay well, this is the governor, Mom. It's not exactly a first name basis kind of thing. Governor Mike? Ooh, I like that. Hello, Governor Mike, I'm Charlotte the Mayor 'round these parts. Okay, well, I don't deserve to be mayor around these parts if I can't get you to school on time. You almost finished? Yeah. Okay. Good luck with Governor Mikey. Thanks. It's just a simple meet and greet. Should be fine. It's never just anything with men like him Oh, and don't forget to take your car in. The engine light was on again. Yes. Right. Thank you. You almost ready? Ready. Okay, see you in the car. Benny. Take me to school. Phone off during class like we talked about, right Benny? Always. Mr. G.'s stories are way more interesting. - Smile, mom. - Oh. Is it bad that I can't picture his face in my head anymore? No, Benny, not at all. That's why we cherish those photos that we still have of him. Okay. Look I Already have 100 likes. 100? What? It's only been five minutes. Benny, how did you do that? You're a social media whiz, kid. I'll pick you up this afternoon? - Yeah. Thanks, Mom. See you later. - Okay. Have a good day. Shoot. Oh, not today. Not today. Ugh. Mom? Yeah, hi. I just dropped Benny off at school and my car is- Yeah, no, I know. I know. I know. You did tell me that. I've just been really busy prepping for this meeting, and- Okay, can you get me and bring me to town hall? Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. See you in a second. Okay bye. Hey, buddy. Everything okay? Yeah, everything's okay. It's just the car, but grandma's coming, so don't worry. Do you want Mr. G. to look at it? Who? Oh, no, no, that's okay. Is everything okay? Yeah, just car troubles. My mom's coming to get me, though, so... Are you a new teacher here? Yeah. Filling in for Mrs. Gaines while she's on maternity. Oh. Mr. G. is way better. You can call me Zack. I'm Charlotte, Benny's mom. Nice to meet you. You're the mayor around these parts, I hear. Mm hmm. Well, I've got to teach a class, but I'll tell you what. I could have a friend swing by, take a look at your car? That's okay. I don't want to bother your friend with that. I'm just going to call Rick's and have them tow it away. It's okay to ask for help every now and then, Mom. I mean, he's a great guy. Much faster than Rick's. You know what? You're right, Benny. Thank you, Zack. That would be a huge help. Yeah. We're going to be late, Mr. G.! - Right. - Right. Yes, me too. Okay, well, bye. And thanks again, Mr. G. I mean, Zack. Zack. Thanks again for this, Mom. Sorry about the car and everything. I've just been really stressed about this meeting and- Oh, no, it's okay. I like spending time with you. So... You gonna tell me who that was back there? Who? The guy?! The cute guy you were talking to. Oh, that's just Benny's new teacher. It's nothing. Oh. What? That's weird. Is something wrong? Yeah, the Governor... He doesn't want to meet at town hall anymore. Oh. Okay, where does he want to meet? The train station. Oh. Yeah. Okay. He didn't say why he wanted to meet here? No, but it is definitely not just a meet and greet anymore. No. Ahem. Mayor Atkins. Governor- Sir, it is an absolute pleasure to finally meet you. This is my mother, Kathy the previous mayor of Snow Falls. Nice to meet you, Governor Mike. So as you can see, this is Snow Falls' train station, but it hasn't been used in over a decade so... Why did you want to meet here? Ah, change, Ms. Atkins. Tourists love coming to these little towns It has a certain unpolished charm to it. And let's be honest, Money means taxes. And taxes are good for both of us. Okay, well, if you wanted to discuss tourist revenue we could have easily done that in my office, Governor. Now, this railroad track connects to how many towns? Two? Three. So imagine five star hotels right here in Snow Falls where people can go out and explore. The tourists can go out and find these art boutiques and very exclusive ski resorts and shopping districts. All of that based right here. Uh. Hmm. Retire. Have you spoken to the other mayors about this? Nah, you're the first. Now we are going to have to do a major amount of renovations on these stations. But luckily, we've got some very generous state funds and I think Snow Falls is going to get the lion's share of those as sort of the central hub. Well, I appreciate the offer, Governor, but no, thank you. Sorry, but what do you mean? Well, please, I've seen this before. You offer these funds and tourist revenue in the short term, but these retirees? They're going to want to live in condos away from hotels. They're going to live in town with their familiar brands and their chain stores. Then our local shops are undercut. Our heritage buildings are torn down and the families of Snow Falls, they're pushed out. Listen, I am here as a courtesy to let you know what will be happening. Not without permits signed by me, Governor. You know, you're absolutely right, Mayor Atkins, but, fortunately, I've got three other mayors in the mountain valley who would be happy to receive my funding. And I hear none of you get along very well Now, the contractors are ready to break ground right after the holidays, and I think once the tourists start coming here and seeing some of these horrible little places, I think all of you are going to realize the profit potential of this place... Including whoever is running against you in the next election. So if you change your mind, give me a call Oh, can't say I was expecting that. Yeah, me neither. All right, so we've covered the gold rush. Now, a little bit of local history. Easy question. What are the names of the three towns around Snow Falls in Mountain Valley? Benny? Green Valley, Rocky River, and Hart Junction. Exactly. And all four towns have a special history with the... Railroad. See, a train linked the towns carrying people, supplies and equipment. It traveled so much that the town's created a Christmas Eve tradition to celebrate their special connection. So every year, the Mayors from three of the towns board a train to one of the other towns bringing special gifts. The mayor of the host town would greet them at the train station and they'd participate in a tree lighting ceremony. There would even be a parade from the train station to the town square. So Green Valley's glass makers would bring handmade bulbs. Rocky River would send ornaments with gems from its mines. Snow Falls would provide the tree and- and Hart Junction... Hart Junction's Blacksmiths would send a bronze star. Cool, huh? All right. Great work today. Good job. Okay, so I'll call Green Valley and Rocky River. Don't you know the mayor at Hart Junction? I did. But we stopped talking once the parade was canceled. Okay, well, we'll still need to reach out because the governor is probably already speaking to the other mayors right now. Yeah. Did anything like this ever happen to you? Well, the odd corporation tried to muscle in, but nothing like this. Why did it stop? The parade? Well, have you ever had a disagreement with one of your friends over where you want to play? Which mayor refused to play? Oh, please don't stop on my account. Enjoying the free lesson... I was just telling Benny that your car is ready. Good as new. Oh. Wow. Must be a really good friend to do that for you. He owes me for the times he would sneak off to talk to the train engineers. Well, please thank him for me? Yeah, I will. How did the meeting go? Oh, well, let's just say I have a lot of work cut out for me. Aw, that's too bad. Good luck with that. Ready to go, Benny? Yeah. See ya tomorrow Mr. G.. Yeah, see ya. Thanks again. Yeah, bye. Bye. And they would all ride on the train and have a big ceremony every year in the middle of town on Christmas Eve. I remember. But the mayors started fighting with each other, and nobody would say they were sorry. So they canceled the parade. You learned all this in school? Mr. G told me he knows everything. Hmm. Sounds like a great guy. Well, it's a shame we lost the parade. Towns used to be so close. That's why we should bring it back. We can say we're sorry and ask the mayors to come back. You can convince them mom. I don't think the train runs anymore. Ask Mr. G.'s friend. Well, you know, I talked to all the mayors, Benny. Well, almost all of them. And I just don't think any of them are keen to do anything together anymore. Well, can we still try? Maybe next year? Oh, Benny. Oh, his dad loved this time of year. Makes it harder on him. I know. I'd give anything to give Benny the best Christmas ever, but this whole governor situation, it's so- Oh, have you spoken to the mayor of Hart Junction yet? Oh, her assistant said she'd called me back. What about Green Valley and Rocky River? I talked to them, but they still want to hear the governor's offer first, so. Well, you became the youngest mayor of Snow Falls without any help at all. You got this. Thanks. Oh, hey. Hi. Car troubles again? No, no, I just dropped Benny off. Actually, I wanted to return this to you. I wondered where that went. The boy in the photo was Benny's father. Benny must have recognized him. Is it okay if I have a copy? Yeah, you should keep it. Are you sure? I insist. Thank you. It's been a while, but he still feels his absence. I think. But he talks about you a lot. He tells me how he comes to your class and waits for me after school. Thank you for that. It means a lot to him. Well, to us. Ah, it's never a problem. Never turn away a curious kid. You know, Benny's too young to remember but that parade was special to me when I was his age, too. And I just realized how important it was for our town yesterday. What do you mean? Do you have plans over lunch? I'd like to show you something if I can. The governor wants to build a mega tourist resort in Mountain Valley with Snow Falls as the main hub. What's wrong with that? Well, it starts with a hotel. Then the local inn closes. Next, a spa. Then, the salon shuts down. And before you know it it's all condos and chain stores. I don't understand what this has to do with the Christmas Eve parade. Well, if we start it back up again and get the mayor's back together maybe the governor will think twice about his plan. Do you think he's really going to care about some small town tradition? Even if he doesn't, it'll prove we're united. Four towns together is a lot stronger than one. And if the parade bonded us before, I don't see why it can't again. All right, when does he want to break ground? After Christmas. This Christmas? Mm hmm. In a week? Mm hmm. Ah. Okay, so the train doesn't work, the mayors are against it, and even if you could pull this off, I mean, who knows if anybody's actually going to show up. I mean, I think you're better off coming up with something else. Well, luckily, I work well under pressure word travels fast in small towns. And, hey, if I can convince a seven year old to eat his vegetables while running a campaign, I think I can convince the mayors to look past money and do what's best for us all. And the train? Well, maybe your friend could fix it? I mean. Even if I ask him, even if he can get it running, I mean, it'd be lucky to pull this off by next Christmas Eve let alone this one. I found this picture of you in the town archives. Oh, wow. You know, teaching history is one thing, Zack but if you show your students that they can be a part of it. Well, I don't need to explain what that would mean for them. And for Benny. You're very persuasive when you're passionate. Well, passion will only get you so far. I can get people to show up to a parade, but I need a working train, Zack. Think about it. Either way, I'm not gonna let this town die. Look mom, I'm Rudolf! - Very cute. - You are. This looks really good. Nice work, you two. Can I put on the star, mom? Yeah, of course. Come here. I'll help you up. Here we go. Ah. Nicely done. Perfect. As mayor of Snow Falls, you are officially the Christmas tree decorator. Speaking of, I gotta- Sounds like you're going to do work. Oh. It is Saturday. I know, but, you know, I only have six days to come up with a plan to give snowfalls the best Christmas ever and I got a lot of work to do. Okay. You two have fun, okay? Come on. What does that mean? Is something wrong? Is Christmas canceled? No. I think she's trying to make your Christmas wishes come true. She's trying to start the - Christmas train parade again? - Shh I didn't say anything. Don't get me in trouble. Then I have my own work to do. Okay. Mayor Atkins... Hello? I'm petitioning the mayor to visit the Snow Falls train station and I think she should bring Benny, too. Okay, we're on our way. See? This is the train I was telling you about. It's cool, right? Oh, wow. Hey! Mr. G.! What's going on? The place looks amazing. Oh, you know, just a few tune ups. Hi, I'm Zack. Hi, I'm Benny's grandma but you can call me Kathy. What's the big surprise, Mr. G.? Oh. What? The train! This is so cool! But how? I had a little help from a friend. Zack, you need to check the air gauge fitting again for the brakes. Well, who have we here? A couple of weary travelers looking for passage on the Christmas train? Everyone meet Oliver, engineer and train enthusiast. Train engineer and historical consultant. Thank you very much. Are you the conductor? And driver, repairman, and restorer of this beautiful behemoth. How did you fix it so quickly? Oh, you know, a little axle grease and tighten a few bolts. Oliver had the spare parts. I've been preparing for this day since I first laid eyes on this incandescent iron idol as a youth. Oliver and I met when I worked at the station. Mayor Atkins, I humbly thank you for the opportunity to restore this stunningly superb steam engine. Oh, no, no. I should be thanking you.You fixed my car. And of course, the town will pay you for your services- I refuse any financial compensation but grant me one request. Ask him what it is. Oh, yes, of course. What is your... request? Allow me to be the caretaker and driver of this nearly lost treasure of the golden age of rail. I promise to treat her with all the love and respect of my newborn daughter. Oh, you have a daughter? I do now. And she's made of wood, iron, and steam. Okay, well, with the power vested in me as mayor of Snow Falls, you are officially the Christmas train conductor. Splendid! Now a tour! Come feast your eyes on Her Majesty. He's always been like this. Ah, mhm. Yeah. At 112,000 pounds. It's two cylinders produce up to 1100 horsepower. This is so cool. So, where did all the decorations come from? From the station. After last parade someone must have kept everything in case it came back. Someone clearly has a great respect for the tradition. Can you drive it, Mr. G? While Zack is more than capable of driving he will remain the brakeman, working under me, the engineer and conductor. I don't want to take his toy away from him I heard that! Now to the rest of the train. The 1914 Grand Pacific Truck coach car. Still with its original wood and fixings. I remember being here with your father, Charlotte. - Aw - and he just- - Oh. - Oh. Did dad ever see this? Yeah, Benny. Yeah, he did. Long time ago. Well, who wants to go see the caboose? Yeah, me. Good idea. Standard CNR caboose. The only changes are due to the accessibility modifications. Historically, a place for the crew to rest and refresh. Oh. So, ready to get going? Wh- Where are we going? Zack said you were on a mission to visit the other towns Yeah but, in this? I mean, what better way to convince the other mayors that you're serious by traveling in the train that started it all? Oh, you'd definitely get points for style. Come on, mom. Let's do it! Yeah. All right. Yes, Let's do it. Yes. I'll go make some adjustments to the engine. Zack can come get me when you're ready to go. Okay. Get ready for Operation Christmas Train. - Sit down. Sit down. - Okay. What is this? Okay, so Green Valley's the closest town So we should go there first. Their mayor is mayor Montgomery. Oh, he's held that position forever. And he's the only one that congratulated me after I won the election. He might be the easiest one to convince, I think. Mr. G., as our history expert, Is there anything we should know about Green Valley before we get there? Well, Green Valley doesn't have the sense of community that Snow Falls does. If Montgomery thinks joining the parade will make his town closer we may have a chance. Yeah? Yeah. Let's do it. All right. Ladies and gentlemen. Next stop: Green Valley. Green Valley. This is really good, Benny. Thanks. I'm proud of you. You did this by yourself - Look at the detail. - Yeah. Good job. Well, we're almost there. This is so awesome, Mr. G. Oliver radioed the railroad authorities. We're good to return to Snow Falls by nine o'clock. Perfect. I love a countdown. Thankfully somebody thrives under pressure Welcome. Hi. Hi. Hi. Welcome. I'm mayor Atkins from Snow Falls. And this is my friend Zack. How are you? We're here to speak to Mayor Montgomery after a phone call we've had with him recently. The mayor just left for his Christmas vacation in the Caribbean. You may speak with me. Great. And you are? Assistant Mayor Spitz. The real power in Green Valley. Fantastic. We would love to actually speak to you about the governor's plans to turn Mountain Valley into one big tourist resort. Why can't we be in the meeting? I think it's best if your mother handles this by herself. But Mr. G. went in. But don't you think your mom and Mr. G. make a good team? Yeah. I really like him. Yeah. Me, too. We have concerns that if any one of the towns accepts his deal, it'll be the end of all of us. You'll be happy to know that Mayor Montgomery dismissed the governor's plans. Oh. I knew he'd see sense in that. Great. But I called him back. Mayor Montgomery will retire soon, and I have my own election campaign ready for when the time comes. The governor promised me a public endorsement. And you trust him? Listen, Assistant Mayor, our town's shared a beautiful tradition many years ago. A tradition that united the entire mountain valley. Yes, Mayor Montgomery mentioned that you spoke about starting that up again? Yes. Actually, we came here today on the very train that started it all. And it still runs like the day it was built. Yeah. You don't say? Mhmm. Have any other mayors agreed? Well, in that case. I wanted to speak to you first because you are clearly the most influential political figure in Mountain Valley. And if any of the other mayors are going to make any sort of decisions, they obviously need to see what you do first. On one hand with the mayor gone, I would have to represent him. The tree lighting ceremony would be a fantastic photo op. On the other hand, if the mayors from Rocky River and Hart Junction don't show up, I'll look desperate. On the other, other hand, if I'm missing, the people of Green Valley might think poorly of me. On the other, other, other hand- - That is a lot of hands. - It's too risky. The ski hill debacle put me on thin ice and I cannot risk another scandal. What happened with the ski hill? It was supposed to be my greatest work as assistant mayor. It took forever to convince the town council to fund the lift, the equipment, the construction... It was supposed to bring Green Valley together. An achievement to mark myself as the next mayor. But it all went wrong. Nobody showed up. What if we helped you with that? Mayor Atkins has a knack for getting people to show up to things. I sure do. I could harness some of our local- She's a social media genius. Yeah, that's how she won her campaign. - I- I did? - You did. - I did? - Yeah. - I did. - You did. - I am. And I did. - You are. - Absolutely. Miss Spitz- - Assistant Mayor Spitz. Assistant Mayor Spitz, if we promise to boost interest in your ski hill, would you attend the Christmas Eve parade as Green Valley's representative? I don't see a good reason to not return the favor... Okay. And would you also then agree to tell the governor that you oppose his tourist resort plans? If you can bring the people to use the ski hill and its facilities, we'd have no reason to accept his offer. Excellent. Okay. I am not a social media genius. No, but we know someone who is. Benny! Yeah. Yes. Yes. Okay. Yeah. Let's do it. Okay. Okay. Okay. But just for the record, I didn't just win my campaign because of social media. I also have excellent ideas. - Okay? - Of course, yeah. - Okay. - Totally. Wait. What made you change your mind about all this? Like you said, it's a chance to make history. So does that mean that you still think this is impossible, though? I didn't say it was impossible. I said it was very unlikely. I still think it is, but I think you're right. If the governor starts building his hotels and resorts, how long is it going to be until he starts overtaking the other towns? I don't want to see that happen to Hart Junction. Why there? It's where I grew up. I haven't been there in a while, but I'd hate to see it lose what makes it unique. Well, I grew up in Snow Falls. I don't want to see that happen there either. That passion tells me why people voted for you. Look, I've spent the last ten years drifting from town to town. The way you talk about community? It's inspiring. Thank you. Are you going to take that? Ah, no, it's okay. Anyway, it seems to make Benny happy. Oh, yeah, I mean, he's normally like this, but just around Christmas time, he loses his spark a little bit. Oh, that kid has got a spark nothing could extinguish. Thank you for looking out for him. Hey, he's a great kid. Mom! How did the meeting go? Hey. Great. Hey. How do you feel about checking out a ski hill? Can I ski with Mr. G? Yeah, you bet. And you might have to do some filming, too, buddy. Let's go. Let's do this. I'll race you there. Put your arms like this. Like this? Yes, but try smiling. I am smiling. Nuh uh. Ah. Okay, a little less smiling... Okay, when I point to you say exactly what I told you. I thought you were the expert. Well, he's the head of my social media department. And go! Looking for cozy Christmas vibes? Green Valley Ski Hill has it all. Cut. Okay, we're missing something here. Is there, like, a costume store around here somewhere? Okay. Rolling in 3, 2, 1. Looking for some cozy Christmas vibes? Green Valley Ski Hill has it all. Holiday lighting, outdoor stereo and all the hot chocolate you can drink. Admission is free, so there's no reason to miss the party. Later, skaters. Oh. Oh! Dance, Benny! Yeah! And cut! Okay, think we got it! It's perfect. Can I see first? Too late! Okay, onto the next one. Okay, Benny. Show us the way. Amazing. That was epic. Ready? - Yeah! - Yes! Woo hoo! Nice. Ooh. Oh look out! And go. Bye. Oh you're good. They're trained- - Merry Christmas! - To the Christmas Train Parade! Looks like it worked. Well, you're lucky that Benny actually knew what he was doing. Oh, that's not luck. That's intuition, right? Something you learn when you work at the North Pole. Ladies and gentlemen, it truly warms my heart to see you all enjoying the slopes today. And a special thanks to our friends from Snow Falls who made this all possible And I'm very proud to announce that Green Valley will be joining Snow Falls in the Christmas train parade. And as our town representative, I myself will be delivering the Green Valley Christmas bulb on Christmas Eve. I say, Governor Tufts can keep his corporate bakeries. Woo! Here, here! Yeah! Woo! Heck yeah! Oliver, I can't thank you enough for all you've done for us today. Pleasure was all mine. Well, my mom and Benny are waiting in the car, but, Zack, thank you so much. Benny really had a great time. That's so great. So did I. I should probably go. Okay. Well, good night. Good night. Thanks again. Lovely family. Yeah, they are. Ever think about settling down yourself? You know I do. Still not talking to her? It's complicated. Hey, mom. Not an easy man to get a hold of. Yeah. Uh, it's just been busy. I was wondering if maybe you might join me for Christmas this year? It's been a while since I've seen you. Uh, there's a lot going on right now Mom, I don't think I can make it. Well, have you at least given any thought to my offer? I need more time. How long exactly is 'more time'? I'll make my decision soon. Hmm. Soon? Another notoriously precise unit of measurement. Good night, mom. If you change your mind, your room is open. I'd love to see you. Well, we'll talk in the future. Okay. Well, he is out cold. It was a long day. Yes, it was. It's nice to see him so happy, though. It's nice to see you happy, too. Oh, yeah. Well, plan's working. You know, Zack's been such a big help, so. Oh, nice try, Mom. What? I didn't say anything. Uh huh. Mr. G. just seems like a nice man. Yeah, except one minute he says the parade will never happen, and then the next he acts like he'll do anything to make it happen. He put on an elf costume. Yeah, that's true. I don't know. I just Hmm. Can't put my finger on it. I say anyone brave enough to dance that badly... Is definitely committed. I got to get some sleep. Okay. You did good work today, Charlotte. Oh, thanks, mom. And maybe give Zack a chance. It's been a while, Charlotte. He always said he wanted you to be happy afterward. No, I know, mom. It's not that. It's just- Maybe I needed to hear that. Good night, sweetheart. Good night. Good morning! - Ah! - Oh! Wow! Quite the entrance. What do we have here? A cake in case we get hungry! I thought we said it was in case the next mayor has a sweet tooth. Eh, that too. Can I ride in the engine with Oliver, mom? Sure, if that's okay with Oliver. No one gets on my train 'till Zack gives me my hat back. Ah, man. All right. All aboard. Come on, grandma! Okay. Hey. Hey! Can you hold this? Ooh, yes, I can. It looks great in here. I love what you've done with the place. Yeah, I keep finding decorations all over the station. It seems like a shame to let them go to waste. It's a good idea. Yeah. Okay, so the next town that we have to go to is Rocky River. Yes. And the mayor is... Ah, Romy. Yeah, they're still electing dogs. Do you know why? No, actually, I don't. Tell me, Mr. historian. Well, it started as a joke about a decade ago. The mayor ran against his own dog because there was no opposing candidate. Well, of course, the dog won. So because of that, there's an amendment to the town charter that states that the dog has to act on the advice of its owner, effectively making them mayor. So, how do you know all this? Well, I was a history teacher in Rocky River for a short while, actually, when Romy was elected. His owner, Healy, should be about 18 now. Yes, I did speak with Healy on the phone and he did tell me that he is interested in restarting the parade, but he does want to hear the governor's offer first. So we're going to have to convince him like we did Spitz. Should've brought dog treats. Okay, so Benny and my mom are going to hang back with Oliver while we look for Healy. Sounds like a plan. So, where do we find this mayor Romy? The dog park? Actually, this time of year, probably right here at the station. Oh, look at the market. Cute, hey? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Well, I've never been to Rocky River's Christmas market before. Really? Mm mm. I'm glad your first time is with me. Me, too. Well, Healy's booth should be around here somewhere. Yes. Let's find this dog owner. Yeah. Two, please. Cheers. Yeah. Now I know as mayor of Snow Falls, you can't take an official position, but, in my opinion, it's the best hot chocolate in Mountain Valley. Yeah, that is really good. Yeah. But that is off the record. Your secret is safe with me. Well, you sure know your way around these towns. I've spent time teaching in all of them for a little while, at least. How come you never stayed in any of them? Ah. Oh, you know... I just never felt like I was in the right place. Not even Hart Junction? I was born there, but hasn't been home in a long time. Still haven't figured out where home is. Not like you and snow falls. True. I really can't imagine myself anywhere else. But I also never imagined myself as the mayor either. So there's that. What do you mean? Well, when Benny's dad passed away, we just really tried to keep busy. And then Benny made this joke about me running for mayor when there were no other candidates after my mother announced her retirement. And really, I just ran to prove that nobody would vote for me. And Benny... He just loved talking to people and taking pictures with everyone. Really it was just fun for us during a time when there wasn't that much fun to be had. And then you won. Yeah. Couldn't believe it. You know, I almost wanted to resign when they announced the results. But, Benny, he just- He really loved telling his friends that his mom was mayor, so I decided to stay on for a year. Next thing you know, three years later, still Mayor. I can imagine what that would be like for a kid. Yeah. I feel like I've barely looked up since I stepped into town hall. I had to hire an assistant just so I could spend some more time with Benny before he grows up and- Starts a life of his own. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Well, he must be here somewhere. I, uh- - Yes. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Let's... - Okay. Let's go. - Okay. Oh, look, there's Mayor Romy. Oh. That's cute. Look at that tie. Hey, there's a line, folks. Sorry. Healy. Mr. G.. What are you doing here? - Here with Mayor Atkins from Snow Falls. - Hi. Oh, we spoke on the phone a few days ago, didn't we? About the parade? Yes. Yes. You said you were interested in having Rocky River rejoin. Right. About that. Governor Tufts came by the other day and offered to help me out with my college tuition, so... What? Is he allowed to do that? No, definitely not. Hey, man, I got made mayor because people like my dog. I don't ask the questions. Okay, Mayor Healey. It's just Healey. Okay, Healey. The tradition that united the four towns of Mountain Valley is super important to us. And the four mayors would get together on Christmas Eve and exchange gifts? I know I took Mr. G's class. Well, we got the train up and running and everything- Oh boy, a train. The mayor of Green Valley agrees that we should put our pasts aside and join together. Stop the governor, inspire the children, save the towns. I get it. But what's the offer? The offer? What is Snow Falls offering me? Cake. Cake. A cake. Cake from the Snow Falls bakery. Okay, uh, I don't eat gluten. Look, you guys thought I'd be sentimental because I'm young? Even if I agreed to your plan good luck getting Hart Junction on board. Okay. What exactly is it that you want? That's just it. There's nothing you two have to offer me that I want. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go walk Romy and then stretch before the Rocky River Christmas competition. What's that? It's a Christmas themed contest. The winner is crowned the Christmas King or Queen. Oh, cute. Cute? Yeah, cute. It's a serious test of one's Christmas spirit. You wouldn't make it past the first round. Want to bet? If I win, you agree to join the parade. And if you lose? Mr. G. will walk Romy for a year. - I'm sorry, I'll do what? - Yes, you will. Shh. - Okay. - You have yourself a deal. And you will agree to tell the governor that you are not interested in cooperating I'd do that for free if Mr. G. walks my dog for a year. A year? Oh, you'll be fine. If this is really a competition about Christmas spirit, I am going to show him a thing or two. Okay. What is this contest exactly? It changes. Sometimes it's a snowball throwing contest or a wreath making competition or even a snowshoe race. So who decides? Last year's Christmas King. Rocky River! Welcome to this year's Christmas competition. This year's challenger is none other than the mayor of Snow Falls. Yeah, woo! Yeah! And she will be taking on me the reigning Christmas king. Boo. And as Christmas king, I've hereby decided that this year's competition will be a gift guessing contest. Our vendors have generously donated gifts from their booths. Each gift has been placed in a wrapped box. And our competitors will get as many shakes as they want. Then what? Then you have to guess what's inside. First to three, wins. I didn't mention it, but I've been doing this since I was five. You know, if you want to just give up now call it a draw Mr. G. doesn't have to do any dog walking and Rocky River won't bother Snow falls on Christmas Eve. I'm not leaving until you agree to the parade. But, nice try, kid. Okay. Okay. A can of maple syrup. Box of Christmas candy canes. Not bad, Mayor Atkins. Not bad. Christmas golf balls. Yes! A novelty ceramics Santa Claus. Psst. What happens if there's a tie? I don't know. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, I'm good. Well, I guess we have a tiebreaker. As Christmas king. I'll pick a gift. And you have to guess what it is. You about ready to give up now? Never. Charlotte, shake it again. Christmas dog treats. Woo! Yeah! Woo! Yes! Congratulations, Mayor Atkins. That was well won. So does this mean you're gonna bring Rocky River back to the parade? I'm a man of my word. I'll be there. And I'll tell Governor Tufts he won't get one inch of Rocky River land. You know... I think this is the first time someone from Snow Falls has won. Oh, thank you, Healey. Good night. Good night. Woo! Thank you, Zack. Well, two down, one to go? Right. That was the most intense Christmas market I've ever been to. Is it okay that Benny's still up there with Oliver? Oh, yeah, absolutely. He's been nothing but respectful up there. In fact, I think Oliver prefers him to me. To be honest. Where's your mom? Oh, she's just trying to get ahold of the mayor of Hart Junction again. Oh. Well, it seems like you've really made an impression on Healey after all these years He was a good student. Curious, like Benny More power hungry. You're really good with kids. Thanks. I think I remember what it was like to be that age. Do you ever get tired teaching them all day? No. Not at all, actually. Their energy is inspiring. I can't wait to be a dad. You know, when I find somewhere to settle down. Well, when do you think that will be? I don't know. I like Snow Falls. So, anyway, how are you feeling about things? Really good. Really inspired, too. Can't believe we're getting so close already. About Hart Junction- Oh, uh. Good evening, Governor. What can I do for you? Good evening, Mayor Atkins. Good evening, Governor Mike. Can we go somewhere private? Going to be okay? Yeah. Just tell my mom and Benny I'll meet them at the car. Okay. I just got a very interesting phone call from the mayor of Rocky River. I think her bark is worse than her bite. Mr. Healy, he said he's changed his mind about my offer, and so has Assistant Mayor Spitz. I guess someone talked some sense into them. Do you really think that this small town parade is gonna stop me? You know, I wasn't sure until right now. Yeah, well, I'm not worried. Well, you should be because three towns oppose a plan that you've probably already promised your hotel and contractor friends Yeah, but I still have Hart Junction, and I can make your re-election campaign very difficult. See, that's the thing about me, Governor. I didn't run for mayor to get re-elected. I ran to do what's best for my town and its people. I've got some tricks, too, you know. And clearly, you do not understand the game that you are playing. Oh, I think I do. Your a little parade is gonna make no difference. Even if you convince Hart Junction those hotels are going in whether you like it or not. Hey, mom. Hey, buddy. It's going to be a big day, so eat up, okay? - Okay. - 'kay. Here you go. Pancakes. Oh, hey, Zack. Hey. Is everything okay? The governor ordered an emergency railroad safety inspection, so all the trains are canceled. But we have to get to Hart Junction tonight. I mean, there's a couple of days before the ceremony. Well, if Mayor Gregory is as tough as they say we're going to need to have that train behind us. Oh, okay. Why don't you come in and we can talk about this more? I've got pancakes. Oh, I'll never say no to pancakes. Okay. Come on in. It's good breakfast. Good. Hey Mr. G., do you want to play a game? Would love to. Why don't I just help clean up in the kitchen first? Oh, no, that's okay. You don't have to do that. Oh, let him help, Charlotte. Okay. I guess it's faster with two, so, thank you. You know, if you have plans for today you don't have to stay. Oh, school's out, Oliver kicked me off the train because I looked at an instrument the wrong way. So, you know what? I have plenty of time. I don't want to cause any pain to you and Benny by being around. Oh. No, no, no, no, you're not. Absolutely, you're not. Right. Cause I can go. No, no. Honestly, it's. It's totally fine. Actually, it's been really nice having someone here to remind me to relax and just enjoy breakfast. I needed that, so, thank you. No problem. Snow Falls passed the rail inspection, but the governor's office is dragging their feet with the other towns. I don't know when you're going to be able to get to Hart Junction. Well, maybe we can drive? I'll keep trying mayor Gregory. Yeah. I have a funny feeling about her. Ah, that's great, Oliver. Thank you so much. Yeah, talk to you soon. Okay, got some hot chocolates here. Who was that? Oliver. Oh. Got a friend at the railroad authorities said we're great to travel. - Hey. Okay - Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Hey, Charlotte... I should get going. Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah. What were you going to say? It's nothing. I should go help Oliver with the train. Yeah, sure. Of course. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Zack, wait. I just- I wanted to say thank you so much for spending the morning with us. I know Benny had a really good time. We both did. No need to thank me. I had a great time, too. You know, it's not easy to let people into our little bubble. It's my job to protect Benny and make sure he doesn't get hurt, so- I have to be really careful about who I trust. I appreciate that. I should get going. Yeah. Yeah. I'll see you tonight? Yeah. Okay, bye. Bye. Good evening, Oliver. I hope this isn't too late for you to take us to Hart Junction tonight. Nothing like an evening train ride and a town to save to keep a conductor awake. Where's Benny? Oh, he's back home with his grandmother. Unfortunately, this trip will take it past his bedtime. Ah, yes. Is everything okay? Yes, yes, just fine. I'll go start the engine. Zack's on the train. Oh, great. It's chilly. Yeah. How are you? Just thinking about Hart Junction. Yeah, must be hard going home. So bright tonight. Yeah. Maybe it's a sign that we're on the right path. What if we get to Hart Junction and the mayor won't agree to come? We'll just have to convince her like we did the other two. And if she won't budge? Look, I've been trying to tell you something but I haven't found the right time. I know the mayor of Hart Junction. I know her quite well. Did you teach one of her kids or something She's my mother. Mr. G. Gregory. It was written on your picture. Yeah. Why didn't you tell us? I tried. But I was ashamed to admit that my mother is the one that ended the tradition we're trying to save. You really should have told me, Zack. I know. And the truth is... I think I need to do this alone. No, no, I'm coming with you. Charlotte, you have to trust me. I should go by myself. No, we have gone too far together. I'm not leaving you now. Charlotte, you don't know- Zack. You owe me this much after not telling me the truth. Charlotte... How are you feeling? Honestly, not great. I was trying to spare you by saying I wanted to do this on my own. Your mom can be that bad. She is. She's stubborn. Well, like I said before, I can handle stubborn. No, it's how she is with people. It's like me. I'm a disappointment. It's always, "failing to live up to my potential." That's ridiculous. You're good at your job, and the kids love you. What is there to be disappointed about? A lot. If you grew up in my house. Well, she's wrong. She's not like you. She fights dirty. Well, it's a good thing you have some backup, then. Don't say I didn't warn you. Wow. This is where you grew up. 'Till the day I was 18. Well, here we go. Zack! You brought company. I'd like to introduce mayor Atkins from Snow Falls. She's a friend of mine. Hi, I tried to correspond with you over the phone, but it's nice to finally meet you in person. Yes, I was unavailable, but it's nice to meet you too. I brought a cake from Snow Falls Bakery. It's world famous. Well, come in, come in. Can Zack take your coat? As the gentleman should. Sure, that would be great. Can I take your coat? Thank you. Thanks. I was just about to have supper. Will you join me? Oh, that would be lovely. Good. Thank you. Is there something I can help you with? Oh, no, I'm fine. But tell me about yourself, though. How long have you been mayor of Snow Falls About three years now. And how do you like it? Oh, I quite enjoy it. You know, it has its trials and tribulations but I really enjoy it for the most part. And have you been accomplishing the goals you set out before your term? Yeah, I'd say so. And I have a few new ones as of late. Have you put together your team for re-election? Mom. What? How's the firm doing now that Walter's retired? Oh, it's been terrible. I have no idea why that man got so lazy all of a sudden. Aside from the fact that he's 80 years old. So what? He's better at being a lawyer than he is at playing golf. I mean, should be able to live his own life, shouldn't he? I can see why you would think that way. So how do you two know each other? We've been working together for the past few days. On what? She's not in the witness box, Mom. I'm just asking questions. I assume things must be getting pretty serious since you brought her home. Oh, no, no, no. No. We're just friends. Her son is in my class. Oh. So, what are you two working on exactly? Um, well, we're working together- We wanted to speak to you about the Christmas train parade. Oh. That's what you wanted to talk to me about on the phone? Yeah, I think it's been gone for far too long, and our towns used to be so close. I feel that whatever happened in the past, it just doesn't matter anymore. I really think it's time our town's joined together again. Mayor Gregory it would be an honor if you would join us for the treelighting ceremony on Christmas Eve. You should have told her she's wasting her time. Mom. Well, there's something else that I should tell you. The governor spoke with me this week and he told me about his plans to turn Mountain Valley into one big tourist resort. I know. You know? Well, he called me with the same offer. So you understand, then, if anyone of the town's accept his offer, it'll be the end for all of us. I do. That's why I turned him down. Oh. Mayor Gregory, that is- that's fantastic news. Thank you. I also spoke to Assistant Mayor Spitz and Mayor Healey about your little plan to revive the parade. Actually, that was my son's idea. He's a great kid. He's sweet, smart, hopeful. It would mean so much to him if we could make this happen. And the Bronze Star from Hart Junction is the last thing that's missing. If you would join us for the parade, I think it would show the governor once and for all that his plan will never work. I don't think so. And you're surprised, why I don't want to come back? All these years and still so stubborn. Do you even remember why you canceled the parade? Of course I remember. The other mayors wanted to use it as a political platform for themselves. I wanted no part of that. Your mother was the only one to agree with- Okay. Please. Please. Please. It doesn't- It doesn't matter why it didn't work out. It doesn't matter whose fault it is. What matters is how we fix it. The governor is not going to stop until he sees Snow Falls, Green Valley, Rocky River and Hart Junction all united against him. Otherwise, he's just going to keep coming back with more offers until one of us accepts and caves and- we're so close. I think that if we just get this parade up and running- I've already done my part to save Hart Junction and Mountain Valley. I see no reason to sing the 12 Days of Christmas underneath a tree with - you and the others. - Well, why not? Well, let's say I go along with your idea. The parade starts up again. Everything goes as planned. Sounds good to me. Until there's another argument. Maybe between you and Mayor Spitz or me and Healey's successor. Doesn't matter. It's inevitable to happen. And then the governor will smell another opportunity. Look we- We don't need to be friendly to protect Mountain Valley. Let's just leave things as they are. What if I took the job at the firm? What? And that's what you want, right? For me to move home. Take a job you're not embarrassed by? Floating around from job to job without ever setting down any roots, that's no life for a grown man. You don't seriously want him to give up teaching? I want what's best for my son. As a mother, I would think you would understand that... If you bring the star, I'll move back when my teaching contract is up. I'm glad to see you're finally coming to your senses. Charlotte? No, no. He is a wonderful teacher. He is passionate, and knowledgeable, and his students love him. You should be proud of him. The world needs more teachers like him, not less. Charlotte, wait. Why would you agree to something like that? This was always going to be the price. I knew the moment you asked me for help. What are you talking about? I didn't want another Gregory to be the reason the Christmas parade was canceled. Okay well if I'd known that was the price, I never would've asked for your help. You said it yourself, you'll do anything to save Mountain Valley. Not this. Benny gets his parade. My mom gets what she wants. Everybody wins. What about you? I'll be fine. You're lying. Why do you care so much? Look, my teaching contract ends in a few weeks, and when that's over, what reason do I have to stay in Snow Falls? Fine. And tell your mom to keep her star. I don't want to get between a mother and her son like this. Charlotte. Everything okay? Let's just get back to Snow Falls. Charlotte, can we talk? What's there to talk about? You're leaving. It's not that simple. It is that simple. Look, you knew I was here temporarily. Then why did you try so hard to make this happen? And to connect with Benny? Because I believe in this. And Benny's a great kid. Yeah, he is. And he doesn't deserve someone just disappearing from his life again. And neither do I. Oh, you didn't have to wait up for me. I know. You okay? Yeah. I'll be fine, thanks. Good night. Night. So, what do you have so far? Well, volunteers are decorating from the station to the square. Okay, that's good. I have the bakery agreeing to do refreshments after the ceremony. Good. You know, this isn't looking half bad. Did the governor get back to you? Yeah. After I told him I changed my mind he got very excited. So he'll be at the square tomorrow. Even if it's just Green Valley and Rocky River. Still no word from Hart Junction? I think it's safe to assume that Mayor Gregory is out, mom. I'm sorry, Charlotte. I knew she had a son but I had no idea it was Zack. It's okay, mom. It's not your fault. He should have told us. Mom! Can we go on the train again? I'll let you two be alone. Maybe after the parade, honey. Got a lot of work to do. Could Mr. G. take me? I think Mr. G. went back to Hart Junction. Oh. Yeah. Why? Oh, well, sometimes adults need to go home, too. Oh. I know, buddy. I'm sorry. I know how much fun you were having with him. Yeah, he's the best. Assistant Mayor Spitz, I've already explained this to Mayor Healey. No, I'm not going. No one from Hart Junction is. Makes no difference to me if you back out. But if you want the citizens of Green Valley to take you seriously in the next election, it's probably best not to be photographed with a dog mayor. Especially after everyone has seen you hip hopping around in that Santa outfit. Mmm. Can I call you back? Okay. Gregory and Son Law office. How can I direct your call? I would never have you answer the phones. What can I do for you, Mom? I looked up your friend, Mayor Atkins? She's quite good, you know. You think so? Mm hmm. She spearheaded the renovation at the Snow Falls Playhouse. It's quite stunning, really, considering what she had to work with. If she's anything like her mother, I'm sure she did it all by herself. I assume you're going somewhere with this? Well, she seemed very upset yesterday. Yeah, we both were. She thinks you're a great teacher and you care about her. Yeah, I do. I know it's hard to accept but I really do want the best for you. I know you do, Mom. I mean it. You float around from job to job never putting down any roots. I mean, it's hard for a mother to accept. Well, it's my life. No, not just yours, Zack. What do you mean? It's all the lives in Mountain Valley. Look, I need you to go down to the train station, because here's what we're going to do. Welcome, citizens of Snow Falls to our recreation of- To our humble recreation of the Christmas train parade. Welcome, citizens of Snow Falls to our humble recreation of the Christmas train parade. Okay. Hey, Benny. We got to get going in 5 minutes. Okay, coming! Okay. Please, don't slam the door. I just need a second. Mom, who is it? Just some carolers. I wanna see! No, no, no, we have to go in 5 minutes. Can you go get your stuff? Thanks. Well? I didn't actually plan what I was going to say 'cause I assumed you'd slam the door in my face. You're lucky it's Christmas Eve. Please take this while I figure out what I'm going to say. Look, you have 2 minutes before I have to go to the town square, so... You're still having the ceremony? Is that really how you want to spend your 2 minutes? Right. Okay, look, here it is. I'm sorry for not being honest from the start. I'm sorry for my mom. I'm sorry for the things that I said, I don't want to leave Snow Falls. Really? How can I trust you now? I know you're upset, and you have every right to be. But please, come to the train station. When? Right now. Zack, people are going to be there in 20 minutes I can't- And Green Valley and Rocky River, they pulled out so I need as many faces as possible when the governor shows up. I can't just- Please. Just come to the train station, and bring Benny. I'm not going to get his hopes up again. You don't ever have to trust me again after this. Okay, fine. I'll meet you there. But we're not staying long. Okay, great. Zack? Coat. Right. Thanks. I'll see you soon. Yeah. Okay. Was that Mr. G? Yeah. Yeah, it was. He wants us to go to the station. And are we? Benny, I'm really sorry that the parade didn't work out the way you hoped. I just- I don't want you to get disappointed again I don't want you to be sad about it, Mom. We did our best, and that's all that matters. But if Mr. G. has something he wants us to see, we should trust him. You think so? It's Christmas. All right. Let's go. Get your coat, okay? It's Christmas. That's the truth. Mom. Hey. Mayor Gregory, what are you doing here? Well, I thought about what you said, Mayor Atkins, and what my son said. Hello, Kathy. Hello, Louise. It's been a while. It has. You haven't changed a bit. Benny, this is my mom, Mayor Gregory. Nice to meet you, ma'am. It's nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Oh, there's something I want to show you. What's that? The Bronze Star! Hey everyone! Oh, look who's here. Woah, careful, Romy! Well, now that we're all here I think a round of applause is in order. For Benny. For reminding us of our forgotten tradition. So we have the light bulb from Green Valley, the ornaments from Rocky River and the Bronze Star from Hart Junction. But, there's something you've all forgotten. Historically, Snow Falls would always designate a goodwill ambassador to place the star on top of the tree. Now, this citizen was someone who exemplified the spirit of the season. Has Snow Falls chosen their ambassador? I nominate Benny. Seconded. Here, here. Well, now that it's settled Benny, do you want to lead the way? Yeah! Come on, everyone! Coming! Snow Falls... It is my pleasure to welcome you to the return of the Christmas Eve parade. Please join me in welcoming my daughter, your mayor, Charlotte. Hello, everyone. On behalf of the citizens of Snow Falls I'd like to welcome you to our town on this Christmas Eve. Now, we have been separated for far too long. But it warms my heart to see all your happy faces joined together in celebration. It doesn't matter why we drifted apart. The parade shows to us that it's never too late to make amends with the people who are important to us. Now I'd like to welcome to the stage assistant Mayor Spitz Healy and Mayor Romy, and Mayor Gregory. Thank you all so much for bringing your traditional gifts tonight, and for finally reuniting Mountain Valley. Now, we also have a very special guest this evening, Governor Tufts. Now, the Christmas Eve parade began many lifetimes ago, and for a brief period, until today, it was canceled. But starting it up again has had such an impact on Mountain Valley. Now, I'd like to invite the governor on stage to say what the parade will mean to him. Thank you for coming. Thank you very much for coming. Thank You. Thank you, Mayor. That was unexpected. It's events like these that make towns like Snow Falls so special. It connects us to the past and it directs us towards the future. It's a gift that's passed down from generation to generation. And that is why I'm so proud to have spearheaded the revival of this important tradition to bring Mountain Valley back together. May this be the first of many more to come! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Thank you, Governor. Will you do us the honors? Woah! Lastly, we'd like to have Benny put the star on. On behalf of Mayor Gregory. Benny, Benny, Benny, Benny, Benny! Benny, Benny! Way to go, Benny! So what did all this cost you? My mother and I made a deal. I told you I didn't want this if that was the price. It's a new deal. Guess she had a change of heart. So she wants me to keep teaching and accepts that this is what I'm meant to do. Turns out I just needed a little backup. So what's this new deal? I promised not to take any temporary contracts and finally set some roots down. So I'm not going anywhere. I sure hope not. This wouldn't have happened without you. You too. Is this the part where I tell you, you were right? Uhm, think we can save it. After all, it is Christmas. Merry Christmas.
