OH. WAS THAT YOU FOLLOWING ME? OF COURSE. I'M GOING WITH YOU. BUT YOU CAN'T. I'M GOING TO PARIS. I KNOW. OH, IT'S SO EXCITING. JEANNINE, GO BACK TO THE SCHOOL, QUICK BEFORE THEY MISS YOU AND COME LOOKING. I'VE GOT TO GET STARTED. DANNY, PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME WITH YOU. NO. PLEASE, DANNY, I WON'T BE IN THE WAY. I'LL HELP YOU. I SPEAK FRENCH AND YOU DON'T, AND YOU'LL HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY ACROSS FRANCE. JEANNINE, I KNOW ALL THAT, PLEASE GO BACK. I HAVE BROUGHT SOMETHING FOR YOU. WHAT IS IT? CHOCOLATE CAKE. CHOCOLATE CAKE. THAT'S A BIG HELP. AND I SPEAK FRENCH. LOOK, JEANNINE, TO GET TO PARIS, I'LL HAVE TO WALK, HITCH RIDES, HOP FREIGHT CARS. NOW, YOU'RE SMART, FOR A GIRL, BUT YOU CAN'T DO ALL THAT. I SPEAK FRENCH. ALL RIGHT, SO YOU SPEAK FRENCH, FOR PETE'S SAKE. AND I WANT TO BE WITH YOU. WELL, YOU CAN'T. YOU'RE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL, AND I'M GOING TO PARIS. THAT'S FINAL. [SOBS] OH, DANNY! [SOBBING] OH, BE REASONABLE, JEANNINE. IF I'VE GOT TO STOP FOR EVERY GIRL THAT STARTS CRYING ALONG THE WAY, I'LL NEVER GET TO PARIS. YOU'RE TOO YOUNG. AND YOU'RE A GIRL. [SOBBING] GO ON BACK TO THE SCHOOL, WILL YOU? I'LL SEND YOU A POSTCARD. [SOBBING] JEANNINE? I'VE GOT TO GET TO PARIS. I'VE GOT TO SEE MY FATHER. MY MOTHER IS IN PARIS TOO. SHE HASN'T BEEN TO SEE ME FOR THREE MONTHS. I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU, JEANNINE, BUT HONEST, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. HAVE YOU GOT A PASSPORT? NO. THERE, YOU SEE? DO YOU HAVE A PASSPORT? NO. AND YOU DON'T SPEAK FRENCH. I DO. I KNOW YOU SPEAK FRENCH. WHY NOT? YOU WERE BORN IN FRANCE. I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE FOR A FEW WEEKS. WAIT A MINUTE, I'M THINKING... HERE, WHILE YOU'RE THINKING. SPEAK FRENCH, HUH? FRENCH... [WALTZ PLAYS] CAN WE CROSS HERE? SURE, I SCOUTED THIS OPERATION. THAT'S WHERE THEY LEAVE THE WATERBIKES. OH, WATERBIKES! THEY'RE SO MUCH FUN, I LOVE-- SHH! [BOTH TALK IN FRENCH] WHAT ARE THEY DOING OUT THERE, ANYWAY? [TALKING IN FRENCH] HE SAYS HE MUST SPEAK THESE WORDS TO HER, WHICH HAVE BEEN TREMBLING ON HIS LIPS AND IN HIS HEART FOR THESE MANY WEEKS. NOW? HE HAS TO SPEAK THEM NOW? [TALKING IN FRENCH] MUSH. HE SAYS THAT A FIRE COURSES THROUGH HIS VEINS, AND THAT ONLY THE TOUCH OF HER RUBY LIPS WILL PUT IT OUT. HE'S CRAZY. [TALKING IN FRENCH] HE SAYS THAT WHEN HE LOOKS INTO HER EYES, TIME STANDS STILL. YEAH, WELL, THAT'S FINE FOR HIM, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO STEAL A WATERBIKE. [TALKING IN FRENCH] WITH TIME STANDING STILL, THEY MIGHT BE THERE FOR HOURS. [TALKING IN FRENCH] GOOD FOR YOU, RUBY-LIPS. Jeannine: IS IT FAR? Danny: NO. YOU SCARED? NO, NOT WITH YOU. LET'S GO! NO ONE WILL FIND IT ON THE OTHER SIDE. DO WE CAMP NOW? NO, NOT YET. FIRST WE SNEAK ACROSS THE FRONTIER INTO FRANCE, THEN WE CAMP. THE FRONTIER IS UP THERE. WHY DO THEY HAVE FRONTIERS, DANNY? I DON'T KNOW. SO THEY CAN TELL ONE COUNTRY FROM ANOTHER, I GUESS. THEY COULD JUST HAVE A SIGN. WHY DO THEY HAVE GUARDS AND MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT? WELL, THEY'VE GOT TO HAVE CUSTOMS AND IMMIGRATION, WELL, IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE FRONTIERS, IT'D BE ALL LIKE ONE BIG COUNTRY. OH, THAT WOULD BE BAD, WOULDN'T IT? WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I GUESS IT WOULD. ANYWAY, WE'VE GOT TO SNEAK ACROSS THE FRONTIER NOW. DANNY-- SHH! [TELEPHONE RINGS] WE WANNA GET AN EARLY START TOMORROW MORNING. IT'S ONE O'CLOCK ALREADY. IT'S THE LATEST I'VE EVER BEEN UP. NO WONDER I'M SLEEPY. ON NEW YEAR'S EVE, MIKE - MIKE'S MY FATHER - MIKE LETS ME STAY UP UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT. MY MOTHER IS USUALLY AWAY FOR THE HOLIDAYS. DANNY, OUR PARENTS ARE GOING TO BE SURPRISED, AREN'T THEY? I GUESS SO. I NEVER KNOW HOW GROWN-UPS ARE GONNA ACT ABOUT ANYTHING, DO YOU? NO, THE LAST TIME MY MOTHER CAME TO SEE ME, SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE CRIED ALL MORNING. THEN SHE LEFT, RIGHT AFTER LUNCH. DOES YOUR MOTHER WORK? WORK? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. MY FATHER WORKS. HE HAS TO TRAVEL AROUND ALL OVER EUROPE. THAT'S WHY HE LEAVES ME IN THE SCHOOL. BUT IF I GET TO PARIS ON MY OWN, THAT'LL SHOW HIM I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. AT LEAST, I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'LL SHOW HIM. I HOPE MY MOTHER FEELS THAT WAY TOO. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD FOR PARENTS TO BE LEFT ALONE TOO MUCH. MMM... BON NUIT, DANNY. GOOD NIGHT. AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME. OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH YOU'RE NOT HALF AS MUCH TROUBLE AS I THOUGHT YOU'D BE. AND AS YOU KNOW, I AM EXPECTED TO HAVE THE PARIS OFFICE OPEN AND OPERATING WITHIN TWO WEEKS AFTER MY ARRIVAL. BUT I AM COMPELLED TO REPORT THAT FORCES BEYOND MY CONTROL HAVE CAUSED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DELAY-- [SHOUTS IN FRENCH] WHAT'S HE SAYING? [BOTH TALK IN FRENCH] THE STAFF ROOM CHAIRS WON'T FIT. YOU MEAN THEY SENT THE WRONG SIZE? NOT AGAIN? WELL, IT'S TOO LATE, WE CAN'T REMODEL THE BUILDING. TELL THEM TO GO AHEAD AND CUT THEM OFF. TRY MY CALL TO THE BANK, PLEASE. EXCUSE ME. OUI, MERCI, MERCI. WHERE WAS I? "THAT FORCES BEYOND MY CONTROL HAVE DE--" OH, YES. BUT FORCES BEYOND MY-- MR. ANDREWS? YES? HE HAS NOT YET COME IN. WHAT? IT'S AFTER 10 O'CLOCK. I'VE GOT CHECKS TO WRITE, BILLS TO PAY, ACCOUNTS TO DEPOSIT. WHERE IS HE? IT'S BECAUSE OF BEING AFTER THE WEEKEND, MR. ANDREWS. OH, YES, HE DISAPPEARS FROM THE BANK EARLY FRIDAY. NOW IT'S WELL INTO MONDAY MORNING. PRETTY SOON IT'LL BE LUNCHTIME. BANG! THERE'LL GO ANOTHER TWO AND A HALF HOURS. WELL, WHAT DID I SAY THERE? "BUT FORCES BEYOND MY CONTROL HAVE DELAYED US." OH, YES. FORCES BEYOND MY CONTROL HAVE DELAYED US... WHO DOES THIS CHARACTER THINK HE IS, MICHELANGELO? TELL HIM THIS IS ONLY OFFICE WOODWORK, NOT THE CEILING OF THE SISTINE CHAPEL. TELL HIM TO STEP ON IT, GO ON. [TALKS IN FRENCH] AND ANYWAY, HE SHOULD BE USING AN AIRBRUSH IN THIS TYPE OF WORK. THAT'S HOW I ORDERED IT, A SPRAYGUN. [TALKING IN FRENCH] WHAT? HE LEARNED HIS CRAFT FROM HIS FATHER, WHO LEARNED IT FROM HIS GRANDFATHER. THEY NEVER USED A "PISTOL-AIR," AN AIRBRUSH. WELL TELL HIM I WANT HIM TO USE A PSCH! PSCH! PSCH! PISTOL-AIR. BECAUSE I WANT SOME SPEED, THAT'S ALL. [PAINTER TALKS IN FRENCH] WHERE'S HE GOING, TO GET THE AIRBRUSH? NO, HE QUIT. OK, WHERE WAS I IN THE LETTER? "THAT FORCES BEYOND MY CONTROL--" OH, YES, YES. FORCES BEYOND MY CONTROL HAVE DELAYED US, BUT... ASK HIM... SWEETLY. [BOTH TALK IN FRENCH] IF YOU REMOVE THIS STATUE, YOU WILL DESTROY THE BEAUTY OF THE ROOM. OH, WELL, LET'S EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT I'M NOT A DESECRATOR OF THE ARTS, BUT WE MUST REMOVE THE STATUE TO PUT THE WATER COOLER HERE. IT'S THE ONLY PLACE LEFT FOR THE WATER COOLER. THE WATER COOLER CAME ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA, AND I THINK IT'S THE ONLY ONE IN PARIS. NOW, IN A HOT SUMMER... [PHONE BUZZES] Woman: MR. ANDREWS? TELEPHONE! EXCUSE ME. THEY'RE CALLING FROM SWITZERLAND AT THE SCHOOL. WELL, THANK YOU. HELLO? HELLO? YES, I'LL WAIT WHAT WAS I SAYING AGAIN? "BUT FORCES BEYOND MY CONTROL--" OH, YES. FORCES BE-- YOU COULD SAY THAT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. COVER THE WHOLE PAGE WITH IT. YES? YES, I'M STILL HERE. SMARTEST THING I EVER DID WAS TO SEND MY BOY TO SCHOOL UP THERE IN SWITZERLAND. I WOULDN'T HAVE HIM IN A FRENCH SCHOOL, IF THEY GUARANTEED ME HE'D WIND UP PRESIDENT. THE SWISS GET THINGS DONE. HELLO? HELLO? YES, THIS IS MR. ANDREWS. YES, DR. SOLEZ. WHAT? [TALKS IN FRENCH] [KNOCKING] ENTREZ. OH, MR. ANDREWS. I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU. THE SWISS POLICE. NO WORD YET. BUT WE SHOULD BE HEARING SOMETHING VERY SOON. HOW LONG HAS DANNY BEEN MISSING? HE APPARENTLY LEFT DURING THE NIGHT. SIT DOWN. NO, NO. I'M TOO NERVOUS. I NOTICED THE PLACE WASN'T VERY WELL PROTECTED WHEN I JUST DROVE IN. DON'T YOU HAVE ANY GUARDS OR NIGHT-WATCH MEN? OF COURSE, BUT THEIR JOB IS TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT, NOT IN. WE DON'T CONSIDER THIS A PRISON. WE'VE NEVER BEEN OBLIGED TO BE ON THE ALERT FOR ESCAPEES. OH. WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. WHY WOULD DANNY RUN AWAY FROM SCHOOL? DID HE HAVE ANY TROUBLE HERE WITH HIS WORK OR CONDUCT? NO, NO, NOT A BIT. WE'RE EQUALLY IN THE DARK, MR. ANDREWS, UNLESS, OF COURSE, HE TOLD YOU ANYTHING IN HIS LETTERS? NO, NOT EXACTLY. WELL, HE SEEMED TO MISS ME. THAT'S ONLY NATURAL I SUPPOSE, A BOY WITH JUST A FATHER. WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A VERY STRONG ATTACHMENT, BUT HE SAID HE WAS DOING ALL RIGHT. HE WAS. BEATS ME. I'VE KNOCKED MYSELF OUT TO GIVE HIM ALL THESE ADVANTAGES, AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT SCHOOLS, AND THEN THIS HAPPENS. WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG? DON'T BE TOO HARSH ON YOURSELF, MR. ANDREWS. IT'S NOT EASY TO BE A FATHER AND MOTHER TO A CHILD OF TEN. YES, AND I HAD TO LEAVE MY BUSINESS IN PARIS NOT ORGANIZED YET, AND IF THAT FALLS THROUGH, I WON'T BE ABLE TO GIVE HIM THESE ADVANTAGES. [KNOCKING] ENTREZ. MADAM DUVAL. BONJOUR, DR. SOLEZ. BONJOUR, MADAME. [BOTH TALK IN FRENCH] BUT FIRST, PLEASE, MAY I INTRODUCE MR. ANDREWS. OH, EXCUSE ME, HOW DO YOU DO? ARE YOU WITH THE POLICE? NO, MR. ANDREWS' SON HAS ALSO RUN AWAY. OH, I DIDN'T KNOW ANOTHER CHILD HAD RUN AWAY. THEY APPARENTLY RAN AWAY TOGETHER. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO? JEANNINE HAD A STRONG ATTACHMENT TO DANNY. I KNEW IT. I WAS CERTAIN JEANNINE WOULD NEVER DO A THING LIKE THIS, UNLESS SHE HAD COME UNDER SOME BAD INFLUENCE. BAD INFLUENCE? MAY I ASK YOU WHAT KIND OF A BOY IS YOUR SON? MY SON'S A FINE BOY. WHAT KIND OF A GIRL IS YOUR DAUGHTER? CERTAINLY NOT THE KIND TO RUN AWAY FROM SCHOOL, UNLESS SOMEBODY FORCED HER. WELL, HOW-- REALLY, DOCTOR, I'M SURPRISED AT YOU, ACCEPTING YOUNG AMERICAN... WHAT DO THEY CALL THEM? DELINQUENTS. NOW, LOOK, LADY-- I'M ONLY SAYING WHAT'S BEEN IN ALL THE PAPERS, IN THE FILMS, ON TELEVISION. MY SON HAS NOT BEEN IN THE PAPERS, OR IN THE FILMS, OR ON TELEVISION. HE'S A NICE BOY, OR HE WAS, UNTIL YOUR FRENCH DAUGHTER GOT HIM INTO TROUBLE. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, MR. ANDREWS, MADAME DUVAL, I DON'T THINK EITHER CHILD INFLUENCED THE OTHER, I'M SURE THEIR DECISION TO LEAVE WAS MUTUALLY AGREED UPON. YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. PLEASE FORGIVE ME, MR. ANDREWS, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I'M WORRIED AND UPSET. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I UNDERSTAND. I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID ANYTHING EITHER. I'M A LITTLE UPSET MYSELF. PLEASE, I'VE ASKED THEM TO SEND IN SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE OF HELP TO US. HE KNEW DANNY, AND PERHAPS CAN GIVE US A CLUE AS TO WHY HE LEFT, WHERE HE MIGHT BE GOING. HE'S THE EARL OF BARNINGHAM. WHO? THIS WAY, YOUR LORDSHIP. DAVID, THIS IS MADAME DUVAL, JEANNINE'S MOTHER. AND MR. ANDREWS, DANNY'S FATHER. LORD BARNINGHAM. ENCHANTE, MADAME. ENCHANTE. I'M VERY PLEASED TO MEET YOU, SIR. HELLO, DAVID. THEY WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. HAS DANNY BEEN FOUND, SIR? NO, NOT YET. TELL ME, DAVID, WHY DID DANNY RUN AWAY FROM SCHOOL? DID HE HAVE ANY DIFFICULTIES HERE? NOTHING THAT I KNOW OF, SIR. ALL THE CHAPS WERE QUITE KEEN ON HIM. HE WAS TEACHING US ABOUT BASEBALL. AND JEANNINE, WAS SHE IN ANY TROUBLE, OR UNHAPPY? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. AND IF SHE WERE, I'M SURE SHE WOULDN'T TELL ANYONE. DID DANNY EVER TALK ABOUT RUNNING AWAY? DID HE EVER MENTION IT TO ANYONE? OH, WE HARDLY EVER TALKED ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE! YOU SEE, WE WERE ALL HELPING HIM. I WAS IN CHARGE OF EQUIPMENT, HE'S WEARING MY SOCKS. MY MOTHER ALWAYS SENDS ME THE WRONG SIZE, BUT THEY FIT DANNY. DAVID IS DANNY'S ROOMMATE, YOU SEE. WHY DIDN'T YOU COME TO ME, IF YOU KNEW OF THIS PLAN? IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SPORTING, SIR. TELL ME, DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING? TO PARIS. PARIS? THAT'S RIGHT, SIR. YOU SEE, HE FEELS THIS WILL SHOW THAT HE'S QUITE CAPABLE OF LOOKING AFTER HIMSELF, SO THAT YOU WILL KEEP HIM WITH YOU IN PARIS. SMASHING IDEA, DON'T YOU THINK, SIR? BUT WHAT ABOUT JEANNINE? WHY DID SHE GO? WELL, I SUPPOSE SHE LIKED BEING WITH DANNY SO MUCH. ACCORDING TO HER SHE'S HIS GIRL. BUT IT'S OVER 400 MILES TO PARIS. DO THEY HAVE ANY MONEY OR FOOD? OH, YES. DANNY HAS 18 SWISS FRANCS AND 30 CENTIMES, AND HE HAS FIVE SANDWICHES. TWO HAM, ONE CHEESE, TWO CUCUMBER. ALSO, HE HAS A CHICKEN LEG, EIGHT BISCUITS, TWO HARDBOILED EGGS AND A VANILLA ECLAIR. ALSO, HE HAS A ST. CHRISTOPHER MEDAL, A RABBIT'S FOOT AND A HINDU GOOD LUCK CHARM. HE'S BOUND TO MAKE IT TO PARIS. I WOULDN'T BET ON IT. I ALREADY HAVE, ONE OF THE CHAPS HERE IS TAKING ALL BETS. VERY ATTRACTIVE ODDS TOO. 20-1 DANNY DOESN'T MAKE IT. OF COURSE, THE ODDS DID GO UP WHEN WE DISCOVERED JEANNINE WAS WITH HIM. SHE'S BOUND TO SLOW HIM DOWN. NO OFFENSE, MADAME, BUT SHE IS A GIRL. WELL, I THINK THAT WILL BE ALL, DAVID. THANK YOU. YOU'VE BEEN MOST HELPFUL. IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE MEETING YOU BOTH, AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT DANNY AND JEANNINE, THEY WILL BE FINE. THANK YOU. YES, YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP, DAVID, BUT TAKE A TIP FROM ME, CHANGE YOUR BET, DANNY WILL BE BACK HERE BY TONIGHT. THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW DANNY AS WELL AS I DO. [PHONE BUZZES] HELLO, OUI? IMAGINE THAT, MAKING BOOK ON MY KID'S CHANCES OF GETTING TO PARIS. [TALKING IN FRENCH] I WISH THEY HAD A GOOD PRICE ON WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO HIM WHEN I CATCH UP WITH HIM. [TALKING IN FRENCH] THAT WAS THE FRENCH POLICE, JUST ACROSS THE BORDER. THEY'VE FOUND A PEDALO AND A SCHOOL CAP. IT LOOKS LIKE THE CHILDREN CROSSED THE LAKE INTO FRANCE DURING THE NIGHT. THEY WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME AND IDENTIFY THE CAP. WELL, OF COURSE. LET'S GO. YOU CAN TAKE THE SCHOOL CAR. THANK YOU. OH, AND YOU BETTER GET THIS NEWS TO HIS LORDSHIP. IT MIGHT CHANGE THE AFTERNOON'S ODDS. [TALKS IN FRENCH] POLICE HAVE FOUND THE PLACE WHERE THE CHILDREN SPENT THE NIGHT. AND JEANNINE'S HAT WAS DISCOVERED NEAR THE ROAD TO PARIS. THEY SENT OUT THEIR DESCRIPTION, THAT'S ABOUT IT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE SCHOOL. NOT ME, I'M TOO JUMPY TO SIT AROUND WAITING FOR THE PHONE TO RING, I'M GOING AFTER THEM. LOOK, WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE ON THIS ROAD, IT'S THE ONLY ROUTE TO PARIS, AND THEY'VE ONLY GOT A FEW HOURS START. WHY, A LITTLE GIRL AND A LITTLE BOY WITH NO MONEY FOR TRAIN-- OH, EXCUSE ME. LOOK, WE CAN FIND THEM OURSELVES BEFORE DINNER TIME. IF WE DID FIND THEM, I COULD TAKE THE NIGHT TRAIN BACK TO MONTE CARLO. AND I COULD GET BACK TO PARIS, BEFORE MY BUSINESS FLIES TO PIECES. LET'S GET A CAR AND HIT THE ROAD. MANY THANKS, UH... MERCI MILLE FOIS. A BIENTOT. [TALKS IN FRENCH] THE CHIEF WANTS TO KNOW WHERE WE'LL BE, WHEN HE HAS NEWS FOR US. OH, WE'LL KEEP CALLING HIM. [TALKS IN FRENCH] COME ON, COME ON. UH, MERCI, MERCI MILLE FOIS. A BIENTOT. [TALKS IN FRENCH] OH, HE SAYS THERE'S NOTHING FOR US. HE'S JUST RENTED HIS LAST CAR TO THIS GENTLEMAN HERE. TELL HIM WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A CAR. TELL HIM WHY. [TALKS IN FRENCH] MADAME. MONSIEUR, MADAME. [TALKS IN FRENCH] HE'LL BE GLAD TO TAKE US TO THE NEXT TOWN. WE'LL SURELY GET A CAR THERE. WHY, THAT'S WONDERFUL. MERCI! [TALKS IN FRENCH] HE HAS JUST TO PICK UP HIS PARENTS AND WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY. [HONKING HORNS] [HONKS HORN] A TOUTE DE SUITE. YOU KNOW, IT'S AWFULLY DECENT OF THE OLD BOY TO GIVE US A LIFT LIKE THIS. YES, IT IS BECAUSE HE HEARD WE WERE LOOKING FOR THE CHILDREN. THE FRENCH, FOR A CHILD, WOULD DO ANYTHING. WELL, YOU KNOW, IN AMERICA WE CARE ABOUT CHILDREN TOO. OH, YES, NO DOUBT, BUT IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME AS IN FRANCE. IN AMERICA, CHILDREN ARE BROUGHT UP ON FROZEN FOOD AND TELEVISION, AND THEY ALL GO TO A PSYCHIATRIST. YES, AND IN FRANCE, YOU GIVE THEM WINE, WHEN THEY OUGHT TO BE HAVING MILK. AND IN AMERICA A BOY WANTS TO GROW UP TO BE PRESIDENT; IN FRANCE HE WANTS TO BE A WINE-TASTER. WHAT A RIDICULOUS THING TO SAY. NO MORE RIDICULOUS THAN WHAT-- [TALKS IN FRENCH] HIS WIFE IS AT HIS UNCLE'S. WE HAVE TO MAKE ONE MORE STOP. AH. WELL, I HOPE HE ONLY HAS ONE WIFE. NO, REALLY, WE GOT TO GET MOVING. YES, I MUST GET BACK TO MONTE CARLO. AND I'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO PARIS BEFORE MY OFFICE OPENS IN THE MORNING. WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. IF I'M NOT THERE TO WATCH THEM, NOTHING GETS DONE. PERHAPS NOTHING IS DONE BECAUSE YOU DO WATCH THEM? UH-OH, I KEEP FORGETTING YOU'RE FRENCH. NO ONE COULD FORGET YOU'RE AN AMERICAN. [ALL TALK IN FRENCH] [SHOUTING IN FRENCH] HE IS ASKING IF YOU COULD CLOSE THE DOOR FOR MADAME. OH, SURE, SURE. WELL, I LIKE YOU, BUT I HARDLY KNOW YOU. I THINK I BETTER GO THIS WAY. LAST ONE IN'S A ROTTEN EGG. MERCI. WELL, I GUESS WE'RE ALL HERE, ALL RIGHT. [TALKS IN FRENCH] HE'S ASKING IF WE'RE DOING ALL RIGHT BACK HERE. OH, SWELL. IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN CRUISING AROUND ON SOME STUFFY YACHT. [TALKS IN FRENCH] I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S SAYING, BUT I FEEL LIKE TINY TIM. EAT. OH, SWELL. I'M GLAD THEY BROUGHT THE FOOD ALONG. IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO MUCH FUN WITHOUT IT. I THINK I'D BETTER GET OUT AND RUN ALONGSIDE THE CAR. AH! [LAUGHS] HEY, YOU KNOW OUR KIDS ARE SMART, THEY'RE WALKING TO PARIS. ALLEZ! [BOTH TALK IN FRENCH] HUH? HE SAYS THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO TELL US HOW TO RUN OUR BUSINESS, BUT SOMEDAY WE OUGHT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL. WELL, SURE! I'LL GO TO SCHOOL IN PARIS. WHAT ABOUT YOU, JEANNINE? OH, I'LL BE SENT BACK, I GUESS. BUT I'LL TRY TO STAY WITH MY MOTHER IN PARIS, AND MAYBE WE CAN GO TO SCHOOL TOGETHER. SWELL. SAY, WHY DON'T WE EAT? I'M DYING OF HUNGER. ALL RIGHT. THAT LOOKS LIKE A SHADY PLACE UP THERE. OH! WHAT IS IT? OH. WHAT'S WRONG? I'VE LEFT THE FOOD IN MY BAG. ON THE TRUCK. WHAT? I'M TERRIBLY SORRY. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED. OH, DANNY, I'M SORRY. AW, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I WASN'T HUNGRY. I SAID "LET'S EAT" JUST TO GET IT OVER WITH. I DIDN'T BRING ANY MONEY OR FOOD, AND NOW I LOST WHAT YOU BROUGHT. OH, DANNY. LET'S NOT MENTION FOOD AT ALL, HUH? WE COULD GET SOMETHING, I GUESS. THE ONLY THING IS, IF WE HAVE TO TAKE A TRAIN OR A BUS ANYWHERE, WE'LL BE IN THE SOUP. SOUP. OH... HONESTLY, JEANNINE, I DON'T MIND IT A BIT. WHY, BACK HOME, WHEN I WAS IN THE CUB SCOUTS, WE USED TO GO ON THESE HIKES, AND FOR TRAINING, SOMETIMES I'D DO WITHOUT FOOD FOR, WELL, A COUPLE OF HOURS. WE'LL TIGHTEN OUR BELTS, HUH? [WHISTLING] JEANNINE! JEANNINE! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! JEANNINE?! AW, JEANNINE. GO AWAY. GO ON TO PARIS. I'M ONLY IN THE WAY. I'M A BURDEN. AW, I WOULDN'T GO TO PARIS WITHOUT YOU, JEANNINE. IT WOULDN'T BE ANY FUN. HONEST, YOU ACT AS IF THAT FOOD WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD. THE ONLY THING IN THE PACKAGE WAS SOME SANDWICHES... SOME HAM AND CHEESE, COOKIES AND...SOME OLD CHOCOLATE BARS... I WANTED TO BE A HELP TO YOU, BECAUSE I SPEAK FRENCH. WELL, SURE YOU DO, AND THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN FOOD. MY NOSE MUST BE RED. HERE. I LOVE YOU, DANNY. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. MUSH. WELL, I DO. MUSH. I'VE GOT TO STOP TALKING ABOUT FOOD. HEY! WHERE'D THIS COME FROM? [SHOUTING IN FRENCH] HUH? HE WANTS HIS BALL. [SHOUTS IN FRENCH] OK. [BOTH TALK IN FRENCH] HUH? DO YOU WANT TO PLAY BALL WITH THEM? OUI. BIEN. OH... [TALKS IN FRENCH] CHICKEN... QUOI? POULET. HAM... HAM? JAMBON. POTATO SALAD... SALADE DU POMME DE TERRE. CHOCOLATE CAKE... GATEAU CHOCOLAT. [TALKING IN FRENCH] SAUVE DE L'ECOLE. [WHISTLES] SUAVE ECOLE? WHAT'S THAT? THAT MEANS RAN AWAY FROM SCHOOL. SAUVE DE L'ECOLE, MAGNIFIQUE! [BOTH TALK IN FRENCH] THE KIDS ARE GOING TO SNEAK US SOME FOOD. [SHOUTING IN FRENCH] [SHOUTING IN FRENCH] LOOK AT THAT HAM AND CHICKEN, AND THE CHOCOLATE CAKE. YEAH. [SHOUTING IN FRENCH] [TALKING IN FRENCH] MMM. I NEVER KNEW FOOD COULD TASTE SO GOOD. IT'S FRENCH FOOD. [BOTH LAUGH] [SHOUTING IN FRENCH] [INDIAN DRUMS] [TALKING IN FRENCH] SO, IT'S ALL WORKED OUT. THEY HAVE 48 COUSINS IN THE NEXT TOWN. THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO THE FAIR. THEY'LL GET US THROUGH. UH-HUH. [TALKS IN FRENCH] DON'T FORGET THE PASSWORD. NO, NO. I HAVE IT. [TALKS IN FRENCH] [SHOUTS IN FRENCH] [TALKS IN FRENCH] WE GO WHEN THEY LIFT THE TABLE UP. AH. AU REVOIR! AU REVOIR! MERCI! MERCI, MONSIEUR. MERCI. IT'S THE BIGGEST SOCK-PRESS IN THE WHOLE OF FRANCE. OH, BUT THEY'RE SWEET! YOU'LL NEVER GET IT OFF THE GROUND, IT WON'T FLY, NEVER! IT'S CLOSED. IT'S THE DINNER HOUR. FOR PETE'S SAKE. WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT? LUNCH TIME. THE CITY HALL, THE POLICE STATION, EVERYTHING'S GOT TO CLOSE DOWN AT LUNCH TIME. THEY SMELL COOKING, THE WHOLE PLACE BECOMES A GHOST TOWN. LOOK, LOOK, NOT A SOUL ON THE STREETS. I WONDER WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE SHOULD BE A FIRE DURING LUNCH? NO, NO, DON'T TELL ME, EVERYBODY GRABS A LEG OF LAMB AND ROASTS IT OVER THE BURNING BUILDING. HA, THE FRENCH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN FRANCE? GETTING MATERIAL FOR A BOOK? WHAT I'M DOING IN FRANCE IS LOOKING FOR MY SON. HE'S SOMEWHERE ALONG THIS ROAD WITH YOUR DAUGHTER, REMEMBER? AND WE'RE HUNG UP HERE WHILE THE POLICE ARE HAVING LUNCH, OR ITS ANNUAL PICNIC OR WHATEVER... [ENGINE APPROACHES] [TALKING IN FRENCH] WE'VE MISSED THEM. DANNY AND JEANNINE HAVE BEEN THROUGH HERE. THOSE DARN KIDS, THEY'RE JET-PROPELLED. AH! YOU SPEAK ENGLISH. I AS WELL. JOLLY GOOD, N'EST-CE PAS? I AM IN ENGLAND WHEN THERE WAS THE WAR. CHEERS! PIP-PIP, N'EST-CE PAS? ER, TOP HOLE. LOOK, WHAT HAVE THE FRENCH POLICE ACCOMPLISHED ABOUT GETTING OUR CHILDREN BACK? WELL, IT IS ACCOMPLISHED! REGARD THIS ROAD. IT CIRCULATES TO THE NEXT TOWN. THERE THE POLICE AWAIT YOUR CHILDREN. THEY CANNOT PENETRATE, YOU SEE? BIT OF ALL RIGHT, N'EST-CE PAS? UH, THAT SOUNDS FINE. LOOK, COULD YOU GET US A CAR? CAR! CAR... YES, A CAR, TO RENT, TO HIRE-- YES, I UNDERSTAND. I AM IN ENGLAND WHEN THERE WAS THE WAR. TIP TOP, N'EST-CE PAS? [TALKS IN FRENCH] HE SAYS THERE'S NO PLACE IN THIS TOWN WHERE WE CAN RENT A CAR. NO PLA-- I'LL BET THERE ARE PLENTY OF RESTAURANTS, THOUGH. THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL ACADEMIES, WHICH GIVE COURSES IN GOOD MANNERS. GOOD MANNERS? AT A TIME LIKE THIS? I'M A FATHER! HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO KEEP YOUR TEMPER LONG ENOUGH TO BECOME A FATHER? LOOK, THIS TOWN WHERE OUR CHILDREN CANNOT PENETRATE, HOW FAR IS IT? 45 KILOMETER. JOLLY GOOD WALK, N'EST-CE PAS? YOU HEARD THAT. 45 KILOMETERS AND NO CAR. ONLY THE FRENCH WOULD LIVE THAT FAR FROM ANYWHERE ELSE. YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU MAY BE THE MOST SURLY, OPINIONATED-- WAIT! LISTEN CAREFULLY.

AND THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT MY DAUGHTER. YOU ARE SURE? BUT THE DESCRIPTION... I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. [ALL TALK IN FRENCH] THEY HAVE GONE. THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH HERE. THEY AVOIDED THE POLICE. I'M NOT SURPRISED. DO NOT UNQUIET YOURSELF, MONSIEUR. A NEW DESCRIPTION WILL BE SENT TO THE FOLLOWING TOWN. THANKS. DID THE KIDS SAY DANNY AND JEANNINE WERE OK? YES, THEY'RE FINE. SOME OF THE LOCAL CHILDREN FED THEM. THE OTHERS GOT THEM THROUGH THE TOWN. [TALKS IN FRENCH] HE'S SORRY HE'S CAUSED US ANY DISTRESS, BUT HE THOUGHT THEY WERE HELPING DANNY AND JEANNINE REACH THEIR PARENTS. OH. OK, OK. MERCI, MERCI. YOU HAVE A TRAIN NOW, AND IN ONE HOUR YOU REACH THE NEXT TOWN. THERE, THE CHIEF OF POLICE WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU. EMPTY-HANDED. SAY, WHAT IS YOUR DAUGHTER? A PROFESSIONAL SMUGGLER? YOUR SON, MAY I REMIND YOU, IS THE RINGLEADER IN THIS ESCAPADE. YOUR DAUGHTER, MAY I REMIND YOU, SPEAKS FRENCH. SHE'S GETTING THEM IN AND OUT OF THESE TOWNS, LIKE THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL. MY SON DOESN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE ANY MORE THAN I DO. SINCE YOU DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE, WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP? [TRAIN WHISTLES] YOUR TRAIN! HURRY! COME ON! SHORT PANTS AND A BERET. THIS EVER GETS OUT BACK HOME, I'M RUINED. THEY WANTED TO CHANGE MY APPEARANCE TOO. THEY WERE GOING TO CUT OFF MY HAIR. I-I COULDN'T LET THEM DO THAT, COULD I, DANNY? I'VE HAD THIS HAIR ALL MY LIFE. MAYBE YOU CAN...PUT IT UP...OR SOMETHING. NO. THERE'S SUCH A LOT OF IT PSSST! [TALKS IN FRENCH] WHAT DID HE SAY? WE'RE SAFE HERE FOR THE NIGHT, BUT WHEN WE COME BACK IN THE MORNING, WE'LL HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF THE POLICE. THEY'RE ALL WATCHING FOR US. OH. IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE IF THE POLICE CAUGHT US NOW. WE MUST BE NEAR PARIS. YEAH, I GUESS. OH, I'M SORRY I'M SUCH A COWARD. THEY'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE ME BECAUSE OF MY HAIR. WE'LL BE CAUGHT AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT. I'M SORRY, DANNY. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I-I BRUSH IT EVERY NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING, AND MY MOTHER'S SO PROUD OF IT. CUT IT OFF! GO ON! CUT IT OFF! ARE YOU SURE? PLEASE, HURRY. [SOBBING] MORE, CUT IT OFF MORE. [SOBS] GEE, JEANNINE. [SOBS LOUDLY] I WON'T HAVE TO BRUSH IT ANYMORE. IT WAS A NUISANCE TAKING CARE OF IT. [SOBS] OK, THAT'S IT. HOW DO I LOOK? I LIKE IT, I THINK YOU LOOK WONDERFUL. DO YOU REALLY? YEAH, HONEST. I FEEL SO LIGHT. IT WON'T TAKE ME SO LONG TO GET READY FOR SCHOOL IN THE MORNING, EITHER. NO. DO I LOOK OLDER? YEAH. YEAH, I THINK SO. [LAUGHING] [WHISTLE] [TALKING IN FRENCH] NEVER MIND, I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. THEY'RE SAYING THAT THEY'VE SENT THE FULL DESCRIPTION AHEAD TO THEIR COLLEAGUES, AND THAT THEY'RE WATCHFULLY ON GUARD. YEAH, WHAT A WAY I PICKED TO LEARN FRENCH. MERCI, MILLE FOIS. MERCI. A BIENTOT. [TALKS IN FRENCH] YOU BIG CLOD, YOU COULDN'T FIND YOUR OWN NOSE WITH BOTH HANDS, A FULL MOON AND RADAR. MERCI BEAUCOUP, MONSIEUR. THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR TODAY, I GUESS, UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO ON TO PARIS, OR BACK TO THE SCHOOL, OR MONTE CARLO. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL I'VE FOUND JEANNINE. OH. WELL, LET'S FIND A PLACE TO SPEND THE NIGHT. ALL RIGHT. [BOTH TALK IN FRENCH] OH, SAY, COULD YOU WAIT ON THAT? I'VE GOT A CALL IN TO DR. SOLEZ. BUT THIS IS TO MONTE CARLO, IT SHOULD ONLY TAKE A FEW MINUTES. BUT I'M CALLING THE SCHOOL, I TOLD YOU. MAYBE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE KIDS? WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT ABOUT MONTE CARLO? DO YOU WANNA PLACE A BET? I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TONIGHT. WELL, I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN PARIS. I'M SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING, BUT I'M NOT. I'M HERE IN THIS ONE-HORSE HOTEL, BECAUSE MY BOY RAN AWAY FROM SCHOOL, AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM, AND I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM AND TO YOUR DAUGHTER. OH, GO AHEAD, CALL MONTE CARLO, DEAUVILLE, CONEY ISLAND, HELP YOURSELF. [TALKS IN FRENCH] UH, WELL, UH... [TELEPHONE RINGS] OH, UH...EXCUSE? HELLO? WHERE? OH, HELLO, DR. SOLEZ!

LOOK, I'M SORRY I PULLED A KNIFE ON YOU ABOUT THE PHONE DOWNSTAIRS. I HAD NO RIGHT TO DO THAT, I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE. I SEEM TO BE AVERAGING ABOUT FOUR APOLOGIES TO THE MILE SINCE WE STARTED OUT. YOU SEE, I'M HOT-TEMPERED. YOU DON'T SAY? OH, YOU HADN'T NOTICED. I'VE BEEN HOPING FOR MY DAUGHTER'S SAKE THAT YOUR SON HASN'T INHERITED YOUR TEMPER. OH, NO, JUST MY BETTER QUALITIES. WHATEVER THEY ARE. OH, NO, DANNY REALLY IS A GREAT KID. I'M CRAZY ABOUT HIM. YOU'LL BE TOO, WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW HIM. THE LITTLE BRAT, RUNNING AWAY FROM SCHOOL LIKE THAT. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] TEMPER. I'M SURE DANNY IS A FINE YOUNG MAN. YOU'D LIKE MY JEANNINE TOO, I THINK. APPARENTLY, WE HAVE WONDERFUL CHILDREN. ALL WE HAVE TO DO NOW IS FIND THEM. DO YOU LIVE ALONE TOO? YES, I'VE BEEN ALONE EVER SINCE MY... SINCE DANNY'S MOTHER DIED. OH. I'M SORRY. OH, NO. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT LITTLE BOY WE TALKED TO IN THE SCHOOL? THE EARL OF WHAT'S-ITS-NAME? YOU KNOW, THE BOOKMAKER? I'VE BEEN THINKING ALL DAY LONG ABOUT WHAT HE SAID, THAT DANNY RAN AWAY FROM SCHOOL BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GET TO PARIS ON HIS OWN. HE WANTED TO PROVE HE WAS SELF-RELIANT, SO THAT I'D KEEP HIM IN PARIS WITH ME. YES. WELL, I... I NEVER REALIZED IT MEANT THAT MUCH, I... WELL, THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT YOU... WELL, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T PUT DANNY IN THAT SCHOOL TO BE RID OF HIM. OH, NO. IT'S A SACRIFICE FOR ME, TO KEEP HIM IN A PLACE LIKE THAT. BUT I WANT HIM TO HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGES I NEVER HAD. YES, I KNOW. I FELT LIKE THAT TOO. I'VE HAD TO EARN MY OWN LIVING SINCE I WAS DIVORCED. MINE AND JEANNINE'S. AND MANY TIMES I'VE TOLD MYSELF WHAT A FINE THING I WAS DOING, SENDING JEANNINE TO SUCH AN EXCELLENT SCHOOL. WELL, THAT'S RIGHT. IS IT? I'VE BEEN THINKING TODAY THAT HAVING JEANNINE IN SCHOOL IN SWITZERLAND GAVE ME A LOT OF FREEDOM IN PARIS. MAYBE THE SCHOOL WAS FOR MY BENEFIT. YOU KNOW, YOU SURPRISE ME. I HAD YOU FIGURED FOR THE KIND OF A WOMAN WHO HAS CHILDREN THE WAY OTHERS HAVE FRENCH POODLES. OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, I'M SORRY, BUT IT WAS YOUR CLOTHES AND YOUR MANNER, AND THE WAY YOU WERE IN SUCH A HURRY TO GET BACK TO MONTE CARLO. I'M GETTING MARRIED IN MONTE CARLO, DAY AFTER TOMORROW. OH... UH, CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. I... I ENVY YOU, YOU'LL HAVE A FINE HOME FOR JEANNINE. OH... I'LL TRY. WE'D BETTER GET TO BED AND MAKE AN EARLY START AFTER OUR RUNAWAYS. GOOD IDEA. GOOD NIGHT.

I'LL BE IN THIS EVENING FOR SURE! NOW, HOW ABOUT MR. FERRAN AND THAT MACHINE TOOL ORDER? BUT IT'S A BIG FACTORY, HE MUST BE THERE! YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT BECAUSE IT'S HIS WIFE'S MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY, HE'S NOT IN THE OFFICE?! WHAT DOES HE DO ON A REAL HOLIDAY? CLOSE DOWN FOR A MONTH? NOW, LOOK, HELENE, THIS IS IMPORTANT. I'VE GOT TO GET THOSE PRICES TO HIM. I'LL TRY PHONING HIM DIRECTLY LATER ON IN THE DAY. OH, YES, YES, I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED. I'M SURE TO BE IN PARIS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING. GOODBYE. OH, GOOD MORNING. YOUR COFFEE DIDN'T GET COLD? NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT. DO YOU REALLY THINK WE'LL BE IN PARIS TODAY? WELL, SURE. THERE'S ONLY ONE ROUTE. THE KIDS ARE BOUND TO BE ON IT. IT'S EARLY, WE'LL MAKE A FAST START. I HOPE I DON'T HOLD US UP, MY CALL SHOULD BE COMING THROUGH BY NOW. NO HURRY. UH, MADAME? I'LL SETTLE UP WHILE YOU'RE WAITING FOR YOUR CALL, AND GO GET SOME TRANSPORTATION. AFTER WHAT WE WENT THROUGH YESTERDAY, I'LL TRY TO GET SOMETHING WELL-UPHOLSTERED. YES, PLEASE. [TELEPHONE RINGS] OH, THAT MUST BE ME. EXCUSE ME. [TALKS IN FRENCH] ER, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW HOW THE GIANTS ARE DOING TODAY, WOULD YOU, MADAME? COMMENT? ER, NEVER MIND... EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? HMM? OH, YES, FINE. HOW CAN I GET MARRIED WITH MY DAUGHTER LOST, SOMEWHERE ALONG THE ROAD TO PARIS? I CAN'T DO IT. WELL, I'VE HEARD ABOUT MARRIAGES BEING POSTPONED AND THE BRIDE AND GROOM STILL LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER. OH, OF COURSE, BUT OMAR HAS INVITED A LOT OF FRIENDS TO MONTE CARLO FOR THE CEREMONY. SOME OF THEM HAVE COME FROM PARIS, LONDON, SWITZERLAND. WHAT CAN I DO? LOOK, I'M GOING ON ANYWAY, IT'S JUST AS EASY TO HUNT TWO KIDS AS ONE. IF YOU FEEL YOU OUGHT TO GET BACK TO MONTE CARLO, I'LL KEEP ON AFTER THEM. WHEN I FIND JEANNINE, I'LL BRING HER-- OH, NO, I COULDN'T DO THAT. I'LL... OH, ER... LET ME THINK ABOUT IT A MOMENT, WILL YOU? SURE. I'LL GO LOOK FOR THE TRANSPORT. [TALKS IN FRENCH] [ENGINE APPROACHES] [HORN HONKS] Andrews: HEY! HO! [HORN HONKS] [GASPS] OH, NO, NOT THAT. NOT AGAIN.

YOU LOOK AT ME AS IF YOU THINK I'M A SPY OR SOMETHING. NO, I DON'T SEE THEIR WAY IS PERFECT, MIND YOU, BUT I DON'T THINK OURS IS EITHER. WELL, MAYBE NOT PERFECT, BUT WE START SOMETHING AND WE GET IT DONE FAST. AH, MAYBE THEY TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME, MAYBE THEY HAVE MORE FUN? FUN? WELL, YOUR FRIEND MR. FERRAN WASN'T IN HIS OFFICE TODAY, YOU WEREN'T IN YOUR OFFICE EITHER, MR. ANDREWS. WELL, YOU KNOW WHY. I WAS LOOKING FOR MY BOY. BET YOU DOLLARS TO DONUTS MR. FERRAN AIN'T LOOKING FOR HIS BOY. MAYBE THE TWO OF THEM WENT FISHING. YOU KNOW, BACK HOME IN PITTSBURGH, I WORKED ON MACHINERY, BIG, AUTOMATIC COMPLICATED STUFF. WELL, YOU OVERLOAD ONE OF THOSE MACHINES, GIVE IT MORE WORK THAN IT CAN HANDLE, AND IT STARTS TO DO THE DARNEDEST THING... IT'S ONLY STAINLESS STEEL AND COPPER WIRE, BUT IT WAS HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH THOSE MACHINES, MR. ANDREWS? THEY AIN'T GOT SENSE ENOUGH TO GO FISHING. WELL, I DON'T KNOW, HUMAN BEINGS OUGHT TO BE SMARTER THAN THAT. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT TILL I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY. OH, I'M KIND OF RUNNING OFF THE MARK. NO. NO, NO. I GO OFF DUTY IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES, YOU WANT ME TO TRY YOUR CALL AGAIN? NO, NEVER MIND. THANKS. WELL, THANKS FOR WHAT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT THANKS ANYWAY. SURE. YOU HEAR THAT GUY? HE SOUNDS MORE LIKE A FRENCHMAN THAN AN AMERICAN. WHY DO YOU SAY FRENCHMAN AS THOUGH IT WERE SOME SORT OF INSULT? AN AMERICAN AS IF THAT WERE AN HONOR? ONE ISN'T NECESSARILY BAD, AND THE OTHER ISN'T NECESSARILY GREAT. I THOUGHT THAT SOLDIER WAS RATHER A NICE HUMAN BEING. I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HE WAS. OH, YOU'RE RIGHT, OF COURSE. I'M ALL MIXED UP, CONFUSED. YOU SAY THAT IN FRENCH? CONFUSION. CONFUSION? WELL, THAT'S JUST ENGLISH WITH A FRENCH ACCENT. PERHAPS WE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT AFTER ALL. MIKE?

TELL ME, IS THE MAN YOU'RE MARRYING RICH? YES. QUITE RICH. IS THAT WRONG? NO, BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO SNEER AT MONEY, DON'T FORGET THE MONEY YOU'RE MARRYING. OH, I'M SORRY, THAT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COME OVER ME. I'M NOT MAKING ANY SENSE ANYMORE. FORGET IT, WILL YOU? OF COURSE. I SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED OUT IN COMPANY. IT'S BEING ALONE, OR JUST HUSTLING FOR BUSINESS FOR SO LONG... I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE ALONE, MIKE. DO YOU? YES. I KNOW IT. THE WORRIES, THE SLEEPING PILLS, CIGARETTES. I KNOW IT ALL. THAT'S THE WAY I LIVE. YOU'RE FRENCH, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW ALL THERE IS ABOUT LIVING. I'M NOT FRENCH, I'M ALONE. JUST AS YOU'RE NOT AN AMERICAN, BUT ALSO ALONE. WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS AND WE'RE ALONE. NATIONALITY DOESN'T HELP US THERE. NO, I GUESS NOT. ANYWAY, I'M SORRY I SAID THAT, ABOUT THE MONEY, I MEAN. IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT WAS PROBABLY TRUE. WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. I'M GOING TO TRY TO GET SOME SLEEP. YOU SHOULD TOO. NO, I... I DON'T THINK I CAN JUST YET, I'M... WELL, YOU KNOW... CONFUSION. YES, I KNOW. YOU'RE A NICE MAN, MIKE. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.

[TALKING IN GERMAN] [CHEERING] GRACIAS. AND NOW PROFESSOR OTTORINO CHIPPOLATA OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MILAN IS TELLING THE CROWD THAT ITALY IS PROUD TO JOIN THE FREE WORLD IN THIS AMAZING DEMONSTRATION OF AMITY AND GOODWILL. [CROWD TALKING AND CHEERING] DANNY, THEY'RE GOING RIGHT TO PARIS FROM HERE. YEAH, WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA DO? TAKE US ON THE HANDLEBARS? IT'S A RACE. MAYBE WE COULD GO IN ONE OF THE TRUCKS? NO, HONEST, JEANNINE, I THINK WE'RE STYMIED. THE SPANISH REPRESENTATIVE ECHOES THE GOOD FEELING THAT PREVAILS HERE. SOUND NEWS? THAT'S THE AMERICAN NEWS REEL. JEANNINE, THIS IS A DESPERATION TRY. JUST STICK WITH ME. [TALKS IN SPANISH] [CHEERING] AND NOW ANDREW GAURY, THE DIRECTOR OF THE ALL-EUROPEAN GOODWILL SPORTS ASSOCIATION. HE WILL SPEAK TO YOU ON-- NO KIDDING? SAY, WE'VE GOT A REAL HUMAN INTEREST EXCLUSIVE HERE. WHICH ONE IS YOUR DAD? THAT ONE! MICHEL BERTRAND? OUI, OUI, OUI. GOOD LUCK, PAPA! SAY, ISN'T THAT CUTE? THEY'VE COME ALL THE WAY DOWN TO WATCH THEIR FATHER WIN THE RACE. WE WANT TO GET A SHOT WE BETTER GET OVER THERE QUICK! NO, NO! NOT NOW, IT IS BAD LUCK BEFORE THE RACE! NONSENSE, COME ON, WE'VE JUST GOT TIME! Commentator: GET IN THERE WITH YOUR DAD. [TALKS IN FRENCH] VERY GOOD. OK, NOW GIVE YOUR DAD A KISS AND WISH HIM LUCK, HUH? HEY!

THEY'RE ON A BICYCLE RACE! A BICYCLE RACE?! WELL, WHAT...? WHAT DOES IT SAY THERE? IT SAYS, "THE SON AND DAUGHTER OF MICHEL BERTRAND, "FRENCH CONTESTANT IN THE ALL-EUROPE "GOODWILL BICYCLE RACE." JEANNINE HAS CUT HER HAIR! AND LOOK AT THE MUG DANNY PICKED FOR A FATHER! IT SAYS THE RACE WILL FINISH AT THE STADIUM IN PARIS. LISTEN, MAJOR, YOU'VE GOT TO GET US A CAR, A VERY FAST CAR.

Commentator: FRENCH CONTESTANT MICHEL BERTRAND, WHOSE CHILDREN WE HAVE WITH US TODAY, IS STILL IN THE LEAD IN THIS ALL-EUROPE GOODWILL BICYCLE RACE. Commentator: UH-OH, HE SEEMS TO BE HAVING A BIT OF TROUBLE WITH THE ITALIAN ENTRY. NOW THE BELGIAN RACER GETS INTO THE ACT WITH A BIT OF FOUL PLAY, THIS OUGHT TO BE INTERESTING! HOWEVER, I'M SURE THAT THE GOODWILL BEHIND THIS RACE WILL PREVAIL IN THE END. THE GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP AND ATHLETIC IDEALS THAT MOTIVATED THIS GOODWILL RACE MAKE THIS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING EVENTS OF THIS OR ANY OTHER YEAR. WAIT A MINUTE, BERTRAND IS DETERMINED TO REGAIN HIS LEAD! WITH A BURST OF SPEED, HE'S BEARING DOWN ON THE BELGIAN, AND HAS JUST JAMMED HIM RIGHT OFF THE ROAD.
