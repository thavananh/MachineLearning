Possible, P-O-S-S-I-B-L-E. Thank you, now I won't have to take extra classes. Are there any other parts you don't get? The rest is just copying words down so I'll do it alone. Are you going to be okay? Will you finish by morning? Not sure, I might sleep. See you. Don't oversleep. This is a "King's Game" that will be conducted within a whole class. Withdrawal at any time is not permitted. The King's order is an absolute order, and must be followed within 24 hours. Order 1, Attendance Number 28, Mizoguchi Yusuke. Confess your love to the girl you like. What's this? Ousama Game Oh, good morning! Good morning. Why didn't you wake me up? I did, several times. - Hey, Chiemi's waiting for you. - I know as much. Here. Oh, thank you. - Making a girl wait, you're terrible. - Shut up. Ouch. Hey! Hey, did you get a weird message yesterday? The "King's Game" one? What was that all about? Not sure, it's probably someone's prank. Sup. Oh, good morning! That hurt. Did you guys see it? The "King's Game" thing. Someone seems happy. Did you send it, Naoya? No, why would 1? Because... right? Ah, that. What? When you were in 8th grade, didn't you send love letters to all the girls trying to see if anyone would reply? You still remember that? Forget it already. You can't really forget something like that. But a girl in our class, huh. Who do you think is good? Why are you picking? How about you, Nobuaki? I mean, I know you've got Chiemi and all. Right? What? You idiot. But yeah, my requirements would be a great rack. You really are an idiot. Tamaoka Gakuen High You really are an idiot. Tamaoka Gakuen High If it were me, I'm pretty sure I would say Sanae. She's in a different class though. Forget the details man. Well, it doesn't concern me even if you get rejected. Right Chiemi? Agreed. So cold to me as usual. Sup. Who is it? So who is it? - Come on. - Come on just say it already. - Who, who! - So who is it? Well... Kamoshita-san. Kamoshita! Kamoshita?! I've liked you for a while. Can you please... go out with me? I'm sorry. You did well! Nice try. From: "The King." Subject: "King's Game" Execution confirmed. From: "The King." Subject: "King's Game" Execution confirmed. From: "The King." Subject: "King's Game" Execution confirmed. Execution confirmed? Execution confirmed? Alright now. That's enough. Who sent this message? Fine. They don't want to answer. It doesn't matter, does it? Yeah, it was pretty entertaining too. But... Mami, just let it go for today. Good morning. Get to your seats please. Let's see. No abscences, I see? Who do you think sent that message? It's not you, right? Why don't you try looking at the address through the reply screen? What? There is no address shown. Seriously? You can't withhold addresses, can you? Could you? I don't think you can, I've never heard of such a thing Are you busy with work tonight too? Hm? Yeah, I've got a meeting early morning tomorrow and I need it. Don't push yourself too hard. You're pretty old already. You're starting to sound more and more like your mother. Order 2, attendance number 4, Inoue Hirofumi. Attendance number 19, Nakao Minako. The two will kiss each other. Kiss? What are you going to do? What'cha gonna do? Who is it? After all that happened yesterday, are you making things more extreme? Don't you think this prank is going too far? You don't have to get so mad. Yeah, I mean it's just a joke, right? You don't have to obey those messages. I don't mind at all. It's just a kiss. Seriously? Are you serious? Wait she's serious? She's going to kiss? Crap. Could it have been his first kiss? Seriously? You stole it then! You better take responsibility. What should I do? What are you going to do? Hey, can't you see that enjoying these things is just wrong? What? Are you pouting just because you weren't chosen? What are you saying? What is this? Execution confirmed? What's wrong? The one who just sent this message is the King right? Order 3, Attendance number 18, Toyoda Hideki will touch the breasts of attendance number 3, Ishii Satomi. Wait, me? No... So what are you going to do? Well I don't really want to do it. What a liar. But, but as you guys all know, the order of the King is absolute. - Are you seriously going to do it? - How are you going to do it? From the front. Hey, you guys out there, cut it out. Shut up, the orders from the King are absolute, right? Yeah that's right! Those guys are seriously messed up. Alright, I got it. You're going to take a day off, right? Sucks to be you, Satomi's going to be absent from being sick. What, that's not cool. I stayed up until midnight mentally training myself for this. You were training for this? Everyone is at the King's bidding. Give us back our boobs! Give it back! Give our... our dreams back to us! Toyoda Hideki and Ishii Satomi did not obey the King's orders. And now their existence will be erased.. Erased? What does that mean? Again? Order 4, attendance number 17 Tasagi Daisuke. Attendance number 20, Nakajima Misaki will have sexual intercourse together. Did you see the message? Yeah. Sexual intercourse means... that, right? Tasaki's alright, but Nakajima has Yashiro. But what did they mean by erased? I don't get it either. What's wrong? Nothing. Sup. What's wrong? Toyoda and Satomi's seats are gone. That's not all. Their lockers are empty too. Why? Anyways, if you're going to give yourself up, do it now. Otherwise I'm going to tell the teacher. Huh? Satomi's number is gone. What? By erased, is this what it meant? No way. It's all a joke, it has to be. Good morning! Hurry up and get seated. What, is something wrong? Um. Did something happen to Toyoda and Ishii? Who? Both of them haven't shown up yet. Wait, who are you talking about? I'm telling you, Toyoda and Ishii. Pull yourself together, there are no such students in this class. Now, sit down. No one's absent today too, I see. The King gives everyone a punishment. This is Satomi's address right? Yeah, that's it. Toyoda and Ishii are gone. When was this? I don't know, but can this... What are we going to do? Don't ask me that. I'm Shirokawa, a second year from Tamaoka High. I am Satomi's classmate. Um, is Satomi... What? I mean, this is Ishii Satomi's home right? Let me. Hey, this is me, Kamoshita. What happened to Satomi? I am Satomi's... Why? Why is everyone lying? It might not be a lie. Think realistically. Removing the desks and stuff from the lockers is possible. But manipulating all cell phones and deleting her number from everyone isn't an easy feat to accomplish. Even in the class roster, other documents Toyoda and Ishii's names were missing. The two are being treated as if they had never existed. But we are the only ones that remember that they did exist. Then are you telling me they really were "erased" by the King? How would you be able to pull that off? Do you think it could be a governmental conspiracy? Like the CIA. Why don't you say something more reasonable? Then... Am I next? Am I going to be erased too if I don't obey? No way. Of course not. But both of them disappeared. It's got to be some mistake. What should I do? I don't want to... I don't want to disappear. I don't want to either. Hey. Tasaki. You. If you lay a hand on Misaki, you better beware. I Know. Hey, Nobuaki. Hm? Can I be with you tonight? What? It looks so delicious. Hey, don't eat before the guests. Chiemi, don't hold back and eat all you want. Thank you very much. By the way, how is your father? I haven't seen him in a while. He's been busy working. He frequently has overnight business trips too. Aww, you should come to our house then. No, I can't... Yeah, otherwise we would never get sushi for dinner. Don't say unneccessary things, idiot. Idiot? Dad, he called me an idiot again. Alright, let's eat now. Thank you for the food. Here you go. OK. - Thank you for the food. - Now now now now. Which to eat first? Don't be so modest, let's eat. It's delicious. Hmm, octopus it is. It's good. Yep. It's great. Are you sleeping already? No. Sorry, but I couldn't seem to sleep. Ah. Go ahead, come in. Is it that strange? I haven't been in your room since elementary school. You came to my room before? Back when my mother died I didn't want to go home where nobody would be there. And you said you would let me stay here until my father would get home. Was it? I don't remember it. I won't forget. Because it made me happy. Was it so? You're always so nice. Execution confirmed. Then Tasaki and Misaki... Well Seems like they've done it. Yahiro won't be happy about this, will he? Probably. Well, I guess I'll go back soon. OK. Order 5 Attendance number 30, Yahiro Shouta will be the King, and his order will be absolute. Hold on, man. I'm scared. Are you all right? The King is enjoying this. Making everyone in the class fight against one another. And laughing in the shadows. Kanazawa. Hey, Kanazawa. Did you really do it with Nakajima? Like I had a choice. She was the one that asked for it. And I don't want to be erased either. Honda, you'd do the same if you were in her shoes, wouldn't you? I, well... What am I going to do? I'll get killed by Yabhiro. I don't think he would go that far. Hey, I beg you. Can you see how he's doing and let me know? Please. Are you' telling me that it's okay if I get erased? Ridiculous. Cut it out. Get away! Stop it. Why don't you think about Misaki's feelings? What does this have to do with any of you? Aren't you being a little bit too self-centered? Misaki is not your belonging. Just because things won't go the way you want it to doesn't mean you can go on a rampage. Fine then. I got you. So... Since I'm the one that gets to make the next order... Tasaki... He's not here? No! Then here's my order. Tasaki Daisuke... Stop it! Tasaki Daisuke... Stop it! Die at this moment, now! - Help... - What's wrong? - me... - Kid? Hey! Are you okay? What's wrong? Huh? From: "The King." Subject: "King's Game" Execution confirmed. Execution confirmed. Tasaki's desk. Seriously? Are you kidding me? Tamaoka Gakuen High Are you okay? You're bleeding. Thank you. Anyways. It can be the smallest thing. If you notice anything, tell us please. Hey are you listening there? Ignore us, we're thinking about it on our own as well. Studying together in a situation like this? Should we try talking to the police? How would we? Do you think they would believe such a story? How about talking about it with a spiritual medium? Is this the work of a ghost? Everyone. Can you listen to me for a bit? We don't know who the King is or where they are. But their objective is to destroy the trust in this class. If we make a mess out of things, we fall straight into their hands. I'm sure there is going to be another message tonight from the King. No matter what it contains, try to react rationally. Hey Kanazawa. I have something to tell you about the "King's Game". What? Oh. It's just rare for you to talk to anyone. I... ...seem to be categorized as apathetic by everyone. I don't mind it. But I am interested in this strange occurrence. And? Kanazawa, what do you think about this game? Hmm... I don't know. I... ...think that it's a curse. A curse? Out of all things, a curse? Is there any other explanation for it? Then, a grudge? Someone in our class cursed us and is laughing in the shadows? No. It could be that the person themselves doesn't know the fact that they are the King. I don't understand. Of course. You wouldn't know, would you? Is that all you needed to say? As of now, yes. See you. What's with her? Chiemi. What? Are you alright? You seem rather unlively nowadays. You think so? Something going on at school? No, nothing, don't worry about it. I see. Then I guess its okay. Hey dad. Order 6, attendance number 22, Hashimoto Naoya. Me? Attendance number 6, Ueda Kana. No, not me! Hold a popularity vote with everyone in the class. The one with the least votes will be punished. The ones who refuse to vote will also be punished. Our class was originally 31 people. But now Satomi, Toyoda, and Tasaki are gone. The three of them were erased. What should I do? I want to cry too. I have a suggestion for that. How many people are in our class right now? 15 guys and 13 girls. All girls will vote for Ueda. Got it? I'm okay with that, but And the guys will vote for Naoya. Then I would lose. Don't worry. I will vote for Ueda. Then it will be a tie. But are you sure that's alright? The King only said not to refuse voting. Then manipulating the vote itself shouldn't be a problem. If you're okay with that. OK. I will save the both of you. I won't let the King do whatever they wish to do for any longer. Kana. Kana. Hashimoto. Then, the last one will be Kana to make it a tie. What's wrong? Hashimoto... What? Wait what's going on? Execution confirmed. Punishment will be given to Ueda Kana who has lost the vote. No. I don't want to. Kana calm down. What now... All of you are horrible. You guys like Hashimoto better than me? I don't want to. I don't want to disappear. Kana! Kana. Someone call the ambulance. Ueda Kana died on her own. In turn, attendance number 26 Matsumoto Masami will be punished. Now, at the moment, confess your sin. What is this? What did you do? Because... Kana's the bad one. She's always so touchy. She deserves to disappear. What are you saying? Matsumoto Masami did not confess her sin and will be erased. Seriously? What now? Kana's... Kana? Kana! Where are you? Where did you go?! This is... the result of what you wanted to happen? It's the worst outcome ever. Hello? It's me. Iwamura? I have to talk to you. It couldn't have been helped. It's not your fault. I was too naive. I should have checked everyone's ballots. Because I had such a half-assed idea. But I was saved as a result. I'm grateful. Uncommon for you to say something that makes me happy. It's not that uncommon. I just don't understand one thing. I looked up some stuff, and I found cases in the past where a whole class went missing. Hey, you and Kanazawa... What kind of a relationship do you guys have? What are you asking all of a sudden? We're just childhood friends. Do you like him? It's not like that. So easy to understand. And, what about this? Second row, 4th from the left. Who does it look like? How about this one? In the classes that went missing. There always was a Kanazawa. What do you think about it? Probably a coincidence. Nobuaki and I, we've been in the same schools since elementary. How can you be sure? The King not only erases people, the King also takes away memories from when they existed. Can you really say that your memories are real? I thought that I was going to be the one punished today. I was ready for it too. You... But in reality, that didn't happen. Ignoring the fact that I manipulated the votes. Why? Why is there no punishment for me? Are you saying that Nobuaki is the King? I haven't said anything like that even once. What's with you? Do you know something? I don't know anything. I just want to find out the truth. From the King? Order 7. A game where everyone in the class competes. Gather all pencils and pens every student has into a box. And each person picks them out taking turns. Each person can take out up to 3 at a time. The one who takes out the last one will be punished. There are only 3 left. What should we do? Kanazawa. If I take one and you take one then the last one will be Kamoshita. Hey, stop that. But if I take two then you will lose. Aren't you going to say save me? If I say that, would you save me? Oono, what is with you? - What are you thinking? - Shut the heck up. During the vote, didn't you say that you'd save both of them? But look at the result. How are you going to take responsibility? It's because of you Kana died. Hold on. That's just a personal vendetta. - Nobuaki was only trying to... - Then Honda. Do you want to take responsibility? If you want to save him. Take off your clothes here. All of them. Chiemi has nothing to do with this. Who are you to talk in this situation? Now, what are you going to do? Don't do it Chiemi. There's no merit in saving a guy like this. Fine. Fine then. If I get undressed then you'll save Nobuaki? Chiemi, stop it. Stop it! Stop it, now! What? It's over already? Take the two pens already. Shouldn't it be "please"? Kneel down and beg. Please. Take the pens. So uncool. Hey, cut it out already. Yeah. Aren't you embarassed of yourself? Nobuaki was... He really was trying to save both me and Ueda. He was even ready to be punished himself. I'll let this all end quickly. It's your turn. Nobuaki. I'll take it. The game has ended. The loser is... Oono Akira? As a punishment, he will be erased. There you go. I took the last one. Congratulations on surviving. Why? I... ...really liked Kana. But when she jumped I couldn't do anything. If it's you guys you might be able to stop this nonsense. See you. Oono! Don't stop me. No one wants to see the moment you get erased. What's with all your sad faces, are you guys coming out of a funeral? How are you guys able to stay so giggly all the time? Well we thought up a really good idea, right? Yeah, a way to get out of this game. I'm sorry that I involved you today. I'm alright now. To be honest I wanted to see the rest of what would have happened. You idiot. See you. Stay with me. My dad's not home today. Where is this? What do you mean? The place in the picture. My mother's hometown. I went there with my father before. We wanted to show my mom her hometown one more time. We took a lot of pictures. And I took most of them. Aren't they pretty good? Sorry I only have prepared curry, I'll go get it ready. It's okay just sit down. Nakao Minako. Punishment will be given for breaking the rules. From: "The King." Subject: "King's Game" Kamoshita Akemi, Yahiro Shouta. Punishment will be given for breaking the rules. From: "The King." Subject: "King's Game" Miyasaki Emi.

Punishment will be given for breaking the rules. They're increasing. Nakajima Misaki, Yamashita Keita, Mizuuchi Yusuke, Shimizu Tomoko, Fujioka Toshiyuki, Kawano Chiaki.

Punishment will be given for breaking the rules. Nakajima Misaki, Yamashita Keita, Mizuuchi Yusuke, Shimizu Tomoko, Fujioka Toshiyuki, Kawano Chiaki. Punishment will be given for breaking the rules. What does it mean by breaking the rules?? What does it mean by breaking the rules? What did they do? Hello? Naoya. Nobuaki. Thank god, are you alright? What did they do? It's Emi and Minako. They suggested an idea. What? It's blocking calls. They blocked messages from the King? "Withdrawal at any time is not permitted." Naoya, call anyone who's still okay. I'll call them too. Make sure to tell them not to block messages from the King. Nobuaki. Order 8, attendance number 16, Shirokawa Nami. Send two messages to someone in the class saying "Die". The ones who receive the message will be erased. If she does not send it, then she will be the one to take the punishment. Good morning. Get seated please. Hurry up and get seated. There are no absences, right? Teacher, don't you think it's strange? What's wrong? Look around you. Everyone's been erased. We're the only ones left. I'm sick of this. I can't take this anymore. Are you okay? Someone take her to the health office. Everyone else, self-study. Take care of her, I will go notify her parents. I've calmed down now. I'm going to go to the bathroom real quick. It's impossible. I can't. Kanazawa, I need a word with you later. What? We might be able to stop this game. Nami? Are you okay? Nami? Nami? Nobuaki! Chiemi. Are you okay? Nami... Hey. Hold on. Shirokawa Nami took her own life. Taking the place of her, attendance number 11 Kanazawa Nobuaki will be messaging the "Die" messages. But the number has been increased to 3. It's my turn. What to do? Take care of Chiemi for me. Hey. Keep a hold of yourself. Hey. Tell me the rest of what you were saying earlier. The King Gives everyone a punishment That's why the King Is always all alone The King Has a very mean heart But wants everyone To give their attention to the King Kurenai-mura To give their attention to the King Kurenai-mura Sadness, Loneliness Sadness, Loneliness All alone and in solitude But that's all The King can do We've found that there were multiple "King's Games" in the past. The oldest recorded is from a school in Yonaki-Mura. It's now a deserted school. Yonaki-Mura? At the time, there were no cellphones, so everything was done through letters. One day, letters were passed in throughout a class where people would disappear if they didn't obey the commands. So if we go to that school we might find something. Let's go. Yes. What's wrong? Nothing. Just that I felt like I've seen this place before. Hurry up, if the sun goes down this place becomes pitch black. Okay. Kurenai High It's larger than I thought. We should split up and search. Seems like that's a better choice. But what are we looking for? Anything that might help us figure out something. If you find anything, just yell out loud and notify us. Naoya. Are you alright? What happened to Nami? I see... Now it's Nobuaki's turn. What? He was ordered to take the place of Nami. If he doesn't obey, he'll be the one to disappear. That can't be! Where... Where is he? He went out with Kaori and the others. They went to a deserted school in Yonaki-Mura. Ilwamura. Yonaki-Mura is only the nickname of the village. It's actually called Kurenai-Mura. Yonaki-Mura's school, out of all the different incidents, is by far the oldest. In other words the origin of the "King's Game". Then Kaori and the others found this news stub too? Most likely. Would you be able to find something out by going to that school? I don't know. Those three probably have a different objective. Ow. Are you awake? What is with you guys? What is this supposed to mean? You should know best, King. King? Me? Don't play dumb. We have proof. Generally speaking, the people who have been erased leave no trace of their existence. Why would these pictures remain if there was indeed a "King's Game"? Then, why? These pictures are a trap that the King set. A trap? You would understand this loophole if you thought about it enough. Well, just because you're studious doesn't mean you're smart. What do you think is the true nature of this "King's Game"? Why would I know? The King gives out an order, and those that don't obey get punished. A game that fulfills a person's desire to possess or dominate. Don't ask if you know already. But, the others only obey the orders that have been given? That's not a fair game. By defeating the King, we win the game. What if that was the other essence to this game? My head hurts. Make it easier to understand. This picture is a hint to finding out who the King is. And we have figured out the true identity of the King. All that's left to do is end it. You guys... Is it possible that they're trying to kill Nobuaki? If they believe that by doing so, this game would end. That can't be. Lost connection. What? Move out of the way. What are you going to do? I'm sorry. But we don't want to disappear. No offense to you, nothing personal. Execution confirmed? What happened? You logged into Kanazawa's personal e-mail didn't you? Did you know the password? Well, by sending it to the three from here it would also mean that they were sent by Kanazawa. Then... Kaori and the others during that vote... He was desperate to save us. I don't want him to die. What a beautiful friendship you have there. But if you do such a thing... Naoya. Naoya! Hey. Do you know the true colors of the "King's Game"? What? We took a lot of pictures, and I took most of them. They're pretty good, aren't they? Why? Why? The previous message was sent by Hashimoto Naoya. He will be erased for breaking the rules. You've got to be kidding me! Come on. Come on! Pick up. Pick up! Naoya? Are you alright? You too. You seem fine. Why did you do this? Please. End this game already. I'm sure you can do it. Naoya? Naoya! Get a hold of yourself! Naoya! Damn it! Damn it! Tell me, what is the "King's Game"? A game to fulfill one's desire to dominate? But... is it really just that? What are you trying to say? Rulers are lonely people, aren't they? What if the objective was to make them realize that fact? What do you mean? Basically this game is a game to punish the King. A game to punish the King? Didn't I say it already? This is a curse. Everything is a curse put on you. A curse on me? Why was it Kanazawa that was set up to look like he was the King? What if he was set up as the King and someone in the class killed him? And when you find out that you were the main reason how would you feel? This game ultimately is made to make you suffer the most. Me suffer the most? What do you mean by that? What is with you? That's a lie. Do you know something? Didn't I say already? All I want is to know the truth. I won't believe anything like that. I'm not going to believe you. Nobuaki? Where are you? Chiemi? Where are you? Are you okay? I called you so many times. Come to the classroom. What? Can you change your own fate? Nobuaki! Nobuaki! Nobuaki...? Nobuaki... Chiemi... So it was all a lie? About how we played together as kids, going to school together, all of that was a forged memory. What are you saying? The picture, did you see it? Picture? Here's a documentation from the time. One day a King sent letters to a school in Yonaki-Mura. All students were erased. Except for one. The last one to survive gets the right to become the King. But they refused to be the King. Instead, a punishment was given. A life where you would never age, but would constantly get involved in this game of death. Chiemi... That's you. The King Gives a punishment to everyone That's why the King Is always all alone No way. Are you going to believe that? Wherever you go, you always start a King's Game. Every time that happens, a class disappears. And your memory is wiped clean and rewritten. Arriving at a different school. Think carefully. A picture like this shouldn't exist. I can't let anymore people to suffer from this game. And in order to accomplish that you need to die here. It's for you, too. No. Don't get fooled. This is a trap. Chiemi, let's end this. No! Iwamura Ria is a potential threat to the continuation of the game. As a punishment, she will be erased. I see... So that's your next move. Don't come here. No! No. No. No. No, stop it. Stop it! Let me go! No! Chiemi... Tell me one thing. I liked you for a long time. Is that all? A fake memory too? No! Chiemi, stop it. Please, don't come closer. No can do. You are going to die here. No! It's time for dinner. Coming. Huh? Isn't there one extra? That's true. Oh my. - I wonder what's wrong with me? - Get yourself together. How about you eat double? I don't want to, I'm on a diet right now. Then let's eat now. Thank you for the food.. On Sunday my boss is going to be moving. So I gotta go help. Nobuaki... The students of 2-B have all been erased. Therefore, the punishment to Honda Chiemi will continue on. Is this the punishment I am to receive? If I don't die then the game won't end? Why? Why do I have to be in this situation? Stop kidding me. No more of this. I won't let you do whatever you want anymore. Half a year later Alright, hey, get to your seats. Come on sit in your seats. Hurry up. Alright, I'll introduce you to a new student today. Is it a girl? Shut up. Alright, come in. Be quiet guys. There she is! Alright, now introduce yourself. My name is Hanemura Reiko. I've moved here from Saitama. Reiko-san! Now now. Hanemura's grades at her previous school were in the top tier. Everyone should learn from her. - Go ahead and sit there, it's an open seat. - Okay. Sit over there. So cute! Treat me well. Treat me well! You're super cute. Treat me well! If there's anything you don't get, feel free to ask me anything. Thank you. Uhm... I'm Honda Chiemi. Nice to meet you.
