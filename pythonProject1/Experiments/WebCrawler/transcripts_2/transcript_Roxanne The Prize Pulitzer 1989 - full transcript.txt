foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- [down-tempo music plays] [Roxanne] Palm Beach was a long way from Cassadaga. If I knew then what I know now, I wonder if it would have made a difference. [dog barking] For eight years, Herbert Pulitzer and I lived a charmed life. We were madly in love. We had two beautiful children. Plenty of money to do whatever we liked. We had it all. So what went wrong? It's funny how being so carefree can make us so careless. [dog barking] If I could just believe that there was a reason why all of it had to happen. [horn honks] [Roxanne] Mom, I really think this one could work. I know I said that about my last two jobs, but this one's different. I don't know. I just think I could be really good at selling insurance. [horn honking] Mom, Randy just got here, and I am not ready. Can I call you later? Yeah. I love you too, Mom. Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah. I love you, too. Bye. [horn honking] Coming, Randy! I guess I'll always be a small-town girl at heart, a small-town girl whose real father left when I was five. I never saw him again. So maybe that's why I got in over my head. Maybe that's why I wanted to please Herbert so much. I don't know. I could think up lots of explanations, and they'd all be partly right. But there was only one truth, and that was that I fell in love with Herbert from the first day we met. Okay, first, we're gonna go after his personal insurance, his house, his plane, his boat. He has his own plane and boat? Honey, this is Palm Beach. They all do. Do I look alright? [Randy] You look gorgeous. Will you come on? Nice, isn't it? [Roxanne] Wow! This is great. Hi. It's so beautiful here. It's like something out of the movies. [Herbert] Yeah, it's not bad for a house, is it? [Randy] Herbert, how are you? [Herbert] Oh, hi, Randy. How are you? Good. Listen, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Herbert Pulitzer, my new assistant, Roxanne Ulrich. -Hi. -Hello, Roxanne. -Hi. It's nice meet you, Mr... -Nice to meet you. No, no. Uh, just call me Herbert. Herbert... Aren't you gonna offer our guests a drink? [Herbert] Oh, yeah, sure. Uh, Susie, this is Roxanne Ulrich. [Roxanne] Hi. You remember Randy. Uh, what can I get you to drink, Roxanne? Um, I'll just have a beer. -[Herbert] Randy? -[Randy] Let me give you a hand. A beer? How charming. And I suppose you drink it out of a bottle. Well, it tastes better that way. I love the outfit. Oh, thank you. I bought it at this adorable new shop back home. -[Susie] Back home? -[Roxanne] Cassadaga. It's Upstate New York. It's near Buffalo. -Here you go. -Thank you. Buffalo? I didn't think there was anyone from Buffalo. Well, I'm not really. I'm from Cassadaga. Easy, Susie. You're gonna have to forgive Susie. She thinks rudeness is her birthright. [Roxanne chuckles] God, I'm sorry. -It's alright. It's okay. -I'm so sorry. [laughs] [Herbert] It's alright. Doesn't matter. -I didn't mean to do that. -It's alright. Look, it's empty anyway. Doesn't make any difference. -I'm sorry. -[Herbert] Doesn't matter. Nothing broke. [Roxanne sighs] Oh! It's taken me six months to get to Herbert Pulitzer, and you blow it for me in ten minutes. Do you realize what the commission would have been on a million-and-a-half-dollar policy, huh? Neither of us would have to work the rest of the year, Roxanne. [Roxanne] I'm sorry. I don't know what happened, Randy. I insist that you go home and change your clothes immediately. That is, if you want to continue to try to sell insurance. I don't understand what the length of my skirt has to do with selling insurance. Neither do I. She's one hell of a saleswoman. I wouldn't get rid of her so fast. You mean you're still interested in buying the policy? Sure. Of course. Get the papers. I'll sign them for you. Hey, Randy. How you doing? [Herbert] Good to see you. Come on. Needless to say, I left New York shortly after that. Why did you move to Palm Beach, Roxanne? Well, when I first left Cassadaga, all I wanted was to live someplace with more than one stoplight. [chuckles] My brother told me that I could live with him in his trailer. -Didn't you like your dinner? -[Susie] I'm full. But you barely ate. In Palm Beach, two grapes is considered overeating. [Roxanne] Hmm. [chuckles] Oh. Not in Cassadaga. [chuckles] As we all can see. Do you ski, Roxanne? Um, yes, I grew up on the slopes. [Herbert] Really? Good. Great. Well, several of us are going to Aspen tomorrow. Do you want to join us? Yeah. [Randy] Sounds good to me. Well, here's to a nice day in Aspen. Drink to that? [glasses clink] -Is that it? -Yeah. That's it? Oh, my gosh! That's so neat. Hey. Excuse me. Is that our stuff? We're missing bags. Help her with the luggage, will you, Randy? -You like to fly? -You're not gonna believe this. I've never flown before. You haven't? -[laughs] No. -Bags! -Well, don't you worry, Roxanne. Alright? I won't let anything happen to you. -You promise? -I promise. Okay. [both laugh] Don't you think it's time we take our seats? [bright music playing] [grunting] You alright? I am cold. I am not having fun. And... [grunts] I want to go in -- now. Randy, take Susie to the lodge and buy her a brandy, will ya? Roxanne, once more from the top? -I'm game. -Great. -We'll meet you at the lodge! [indistinct conversations] It is so beautiful here. This is the first time I've ever skied west of the Alleghenies. I'd like to spend some more time with you, Roxanne... if you're free. Yeah, I'm free. What about Susie? Someone told me you guys are getting married. Susie would like to. I have no intention of marrying Susie. Hm. But you guys have been seeing each other for so long. It's...convenience. You know, it's comfortable. Been easy. Until now. Why now? Because...I like you. I'd like to spend some more time with you. I don't know what to say. [giggles] What about "yes"? -Yes. -Thank you. [both laugh] [laughter] -Where's Susan? -She's gone! -Gone? -Yeah. Here. [soft music playing] -Gone? -Yeah. So is Randy. [both laugh] I have never known anybody like you before. You know that? [giggling] Ahh! It's really cold! [moans] [grunting] -Got it? -There you go. Put your plant over there. -Yes. -Good. Great. [dog barking] [Roxanne] When Herbert asked me to move in with him, I was overjoyed. I stopped selling insurance and I started doing everything I could to make him happy because that's what made me happy. [Roxanne] What are these? [Herbert] Uh, invitations to some society parties. [Roxanne] Aren't you even gonna open them? No, I'm not really interested in going. Why? They seem like they could be some really important parties. Yeah, well, they are. They are, but... I just... [Roxanne] What? They want me to go alone. Okay? And I don't want to go anywhere without you. I was sure Greta was gonna hate being on safari, but she loved it! -Oh, yeah! I spent four months in Kenya last year. The hunting's terrific. I had a wonderful time. -Dad! Dad! -The hunting was great. -Hey! There you are! -[shrieks] How are you? Ohh! It's good to see you. -Oh, I haven't seen you in ages! -You look terrific! I know, baby. I'm sorry. I've been so busy. Come here. Let me introduce you to somebody. Roxanne, this is my daughter, Liza. -This is Roxanne. -Hi. Nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you. You remember Greta and Arthur. -Good to see you again. -[Arthur] Liza. Dad, what's this I hear about you going off to Colorado? Are you gonna miss my birthday? [Herbert] Oh, I'm sorry, baby. Listen. We'll celebrate when I get back, okay? I didn't know that we were going to Colorado again. I hope you and Susie have a good time. Bye. -Bye. Oh, it was so nice meeting you. God. I forgot your name. I'm sorry. -Roxanne. -[Liza] Right. -Bye, you guys. -[woman] Bye-bye. -Bye. -Bye, baby. [dance music playing] [Herbert] Roxy, just remember I'm crazy about you, okay? Running away with your ex-girlfriend for the weekend is sure a funny way of showing it. Ah, come on. We've been all through that. I just need to know how I feel without you. Are you sure it's how you feel without me? Or is it how you feel being with her again? [woman on PA] Flight 223 for Atlanta is departing... [Roxanne] Don't look so sad. We'll see each other before you know it. You won't be able to live without me. Please proceed to gate 12. Well, I'm sure if it was meant to be between you and this, uh -- what's his name -- Herbert -- -Hi. -Hi, honey. It'll work out. You'll see. Roxanne, there's some guy outside who wants to talk to you. Delicious. Mmm! I missed you. I missed you, too. You're so beautiful. Mom, Dad, this is -- this is Herbert Pulitzer. And this is my mom and dad, Ty and Marilyn. -How do you do? -How do you do? -It's nice to meet both of you. -It's nice meeting you. [Marilyn] Nice to meet you. How do you do? Would you -- Do you want to come in and have a drink with us? No, thank you. I-I borrowed a friend's plane -- and I got to get it back home. -[telephone rings] -Excuse me. Hello? Yes. Come on out on the porch. I want to talk to you. [Marilyn] Well, I can't talk now. How are ya? -I'm okay. -Good. Good. -How are you? -I'm fine. I'm fine. You know, we're gonna be very busy for a couple months now. We got a lot to do. I got to finish building the boat. And, uh, we got to work on the -- the ranch. There's a lot of work t-to be done on the ranch and the Christmas party. All the arrangements have to be made for the Christmas party. And we're gonna have to get married. -[exhales sharply] -Roxy. Yeah. We're gonna have to do all that. Yeah, we are. Yes, we're gonna have to do all that stuff. [chuckles] I think so. Oh, Rox. [both laughing] You excite me so much! Don't you think seven years is long enough to be a bachelor? -Huh? Uh-huh! -Yeah. [laughs] [woman] Have you decided who you're having cater the affair? Well, Herbert's handling all the arrangements. The only decision he's left me with is what to wear. To be honest, I wish you'd help me do that, too. I can't seem to find anything. There's only one shop to go to, and that's Martha's on Werth Avenue. I'll call Martha and tell her to expect you. She'll handle everything. Thanks! -Hello, Herbert. -Excuse us. I hear congratulations are in order. Thank you. Roxanne, I'd like you to meet Lily Rousseau, my ex-wife. Yeah. Liza's told me all about you, dear. Good luck to you. Thanks. I hope he doesn't ruin your life the way he ruined mine. [Herbert sighs] Roxanne. What did she mean, ruin my life? Well, yeah. It was a bitter divorce. There's still a lot of hard feelings. I was a terrible husband to Lilly. I cheated on her... I was never home... I had no relationship with the kids. None. I never even saw them when -- when they were little. Roxy, I don't want that to happen to our marriage. Then it won't. I can promise you that our marriage is not gonna be anything like your last one. Okay. No. Listen to me. I mean it. I mean it. When we have children, you're gonna be -- you're gonna be close to them... Roxy, I don't want to have any more children. I didn't mean now. I meant in the future. I've got three children. I really don't need any more. What about me? Roxy, it doesn't seem particularly fair to you, I know, but... I saw what happened when we had three children. I don't want that to happen to us. Children change everything. They come between a husband and a wife. Roxy, I don't want to share you with anybody. I don't. I want things to be just like they are right now. Hmm? Ahh. -[sighs] Listen to me. -What? If you're telling me that I can't have children... I don't think I can marry you if you're not gonna let me -have children. -Oh, come on, Roxy. -I mean it. -Get serious. -No, I am being serious. Rox. [door closes] [soft music playing] Roxy. Please don't spoil our first Christmas together. [sniffles] Alright. I'll make a deal with you. You can have one child. Okay? But only one child. And you got to agree with me to have a nanny live in so that you can travel with me. You got to promise me that you and I will never have to be apart. Okay? I want us to go home together and get up together. Yes. I promise. -I promise. -Okay. Thank you. [both laugh] [cheers, applause, laughter] Love you, Mommy. [chuckles] [woman] Bye! [man] Congratulations, you two! [Roxanne] Ready? Ready? -Aah! -[laughter] -[man] Good luck! -[woman] Bye! [gentle music playing] [indistinct conversations] I'm so happy. I am. You know that? -[giggles] -Come on. -Let's go. -Yes. Herbert, where are you going? Come on. Get dressed. We're going fishing. Fishing? Herbert, this is our honeymoon! Well, can't spend the whole time in bed. Do you have any idea what time it is? [grand music playing] [Roxanne] Herbert! [laughs] Look! What do I do?! Where is it?! Keep doing what you're doing. You're doing great. -Come on. Come on. -Uh-huh. Pull. Pull that in. And then when you release, crank. -[Roxanne] Okay. -Thatagirl. That's great! -[laughs] -[shrieks] Come on. He's biting you, now. Don't let him win. [reel clicking, Roxanne laughs] [Roxanne] Oh. It was great. Thanks, Joyce. Well, everything here at home went very well. -These are for you. -What are they? Charity balls. Decide which ones you want to go to. Mr. Pulitzer. Welcome. -How nice to see you. -Hi. -Mrs. Pulitzer. -Good to see you. Yes. Just the ones we talked about, right? Right, right. As you know, it's very late in the season, so our selections are quite limited. We have several beautiful gowns you may like. You'll look stunning in this one. Strapless, heart-shaped bodice. Deep bend opens up the leg for dramatic effect. [chuckles] I can't believe this. [woman] Princess length cape transforms our version of the little black dress. You'll be an irresistible butterfly in this dazzling chiffon... -You see anything you like? -Yeah. They're all so beautiful. Which one do you like? Oh, no, no, no, no, Mrs. Pulitzer. [smooches] This is your decision. Where are you going? Please. Come on. It's my first charity ball. [softly] Herbert! Well? Did I make the right decision? Yes. -Are you sure? -Absolutely. I was so scared I'd make the wrong decision. -You look wonderful. -[laughs] Roxy. Ohh. I want you to do something for me. Anything. You know that. Don't wear anything underneath that. Then whenever I look at you, I'll know. [giggles] [orchestra playing] [chatter] Tell me, Roxanne -- where did you say you went to school? In Cassadaga. Oh, I'm not familiar with the schools in Cassadaga. -No, I'm not. I -- -What colleges are there? Well, actually, there's only one school, and it's from kindergarten through 12th. -Ohh! -Roxanne, my dear. Tell me, won't you, what does your father do? Well, actually, he's my stepfather, but he's in law. Really? What did you say your last name was? Ulrich. Ulrich? Of course! Your father's a judge, isn't he? No. Actually, he's a cop. Ohh. [laughter] [chatter] -Hi. -Hi. Thank you. Don't mind them. If you don't have all the right credentials and your family has not been in the social register for years, they really are not interested in you. Oh, well, then why'd they ask me all those questions? Well, they're all curious to find out about the woman Peter Pulitzer married. You know, he built himself quite a reputation as a bachelor in this town. Yeah, so I've heard. A word of caution? We may run into a few ladies tonight who are not pleased that you've taken him out of circulation. Hmm. Thank you for the warning. Anytime. By the way, Lorraine Odasso. Roxanne. -It's nice to meet you. -Oh. It's really nice to finally meet somebody who's friendly. You enjoy yourself tonight, okay? -Alright. -Alright. -Thanks. -Bye. Herbert, would you and Roxanne join us at Cannes this year? Since we're all going to be there. [Herbert] Yes, Norm, I'd love to do that. [Norm] We're going to open the villa in I imagine about three weeks. [chatter] [conversation in French] [mouthing words] [mouthing words] -Hasn't it? -Yes. I've seen... -It's so weird! -It's fun, isn't it? -Yeah, it's just -- -Yeah? You like it? -I don't know. -Sure you do. Come on. -Herbert! -Hey, Jim! -How are ya? -How are ya? -Hi. I'm Roxanne. -Hi. Jacquie Kimberly. -Nice to meet you. -Jim, this is Roxanne. Roxanne, this is my good friend Jim Kimberly. -My pleasure. -And his wife, Jacquie. I guess you just met. Oh, I see you got the full tour, huh? Yes, I definitely did. [chuckles] All the new wives get it. We'll have to have lunch and compare notes. -I'd like that. -Great. That'd be really nice. Listen. Maybe we could play some doubles on the weekend? -Great. -Sure, but I don't play tennis. -I mean, at all. -Oh, that's alright. I'm sure Herbert can fix that, huh? -Yeah. -You can take care of that? -I'll call you. -Okay. Great. -We'll see you later. Bye-bye. -Bye. -She wants to have lunch. -Good. Great. You can learn a lot from Jacquie. Hmm, well, I better learn something because I have not had anything in common with anyone. Well, so you'll take tennis lessons at the club starting tomorrow morning, okay? I think it's gonna take a lot more than one tennis lesson, sweetheart. You let me take care of that. Okay? Okay? [giggles] Hey. Come on. Let's get out of here. It's driving me crazy knowing you don't have on anything under there. Why do we have to wait? -Hmm? -You heard me. -Why do we have to wait? -Hm? Come on. Come here. [slam] [Herbert and Roxanne laugh] -Morning. -[Herbert] There you go. Follow through as best as you can. [chatter] I talked to Jim. We're playing doubles with him and Jacquie on Saturday. [Roxanne] Herbert, that was only my first tennis lesson. Good. Yeah. That gives you a whole week to practice. Just make sure you're home by three because that's when the French tutor comes. -French tutor? -Mm-hmm. Didn't you tell me that you wanted to learn French 'cause everybody around here speaks it? Rox? Parlez-vous Francais? Oui. Je m'appelle Francais? -[squeals] -[laughs] -Hm. What's this? -I went to the bookstore and I picked up some stuff for you. -Art. -Mm-hmm. Literature. And science. Hmm. Am I in college? [giggles] You're my little college students. Come get a lesson from your professor, huh? Mmm! [giggling] [Herbert] Oh, you're such a good student. [both laugh] So, did they roll out the red carpet for you in Palm Beach like they did for me? Yeah, right. How'd you guess? They don't like outsiders in this town. [chatter] Especially young women who take away their eligible men. [Roxanne chuckles] When I first met Jim, I was 16 and I was working in this little dress shop on Werth Avenue. When we first started dating, people practically called me a gold digger to my face. But once I became Mrs. Kimberly, heir to the great fortune, they merely whispered it behind my back. Doesn't that bother you? Living well is the best revenge. [laughs] [server] Would you like to hear our specials, Mrs. Kimberly? -Oh, we're not hungry, are we? -No. Just the champagne for now. Thank you. You know, I like you, Roxanne. I hope we can become friends. -Me too. -We have a lot in common. We're both outsiders. But I have to warn you. Being my friend means you're gonna end up with a reputation. What? Here you go. To new best friends. -I'll drink to that. -Alright. Okay. And a new haircut. Who's been cutting your hair? My hair? I haven't had my hair cut in years. We're gonna have to change that. Victor, bring us the phone, please. Alright. I want to call Herbert and tell him you'll be home at seven. -Where are we going? -You'll see. [car engine revs] [jet engine whining] [Jacquie] Now, to become a true Palm Beach girl, there's just a few essentials. Haircuts at the Clyde Summer Salon on Fifth Avenue... manicures from Domani, who comes to your house at least three times a week... facials from Georgette Klinger's, and massages from Elizabeth Arden. [siren wails] -Thank you very much. -[horn blares] I can't believe that you just spent $10,000 on clothes. [laughs] Isn't Jim gonna kill you? Not when he sees me in them. Besides, my clothes and my jewels are like my own little retirement fund -- the only real possessions I'll have if Jim and I ever split. It's getting late. Herbert's gonna be angry at me. Mix him a pitcher of martinis, slip into something sexy, and he'll forget how late you were in no time. [chuckles] [engine starts] -Really? -Yeah. Driver, to the airport, please. [Herbert] We're leaving for the ranch in the morning. [Roxanne] Herbert punished me all weekend for going to New York with Jacquie. He wouldn't talk to me. He wouldn't make love to me. I'd never seen him act that way before. I even mixed up some martinis and slipped into something sexy like Jacquie had suggested. [chuckles] But nothing worked. I really thought it was over. [breathes sharply] I'm sorry. It's okay. It's not okay. I'm pregnant. With twins. Twins. With twins, huh? -[both laugh] -Is that okay? [laughs] Yeah! What can I do? Really? [both laugh] [babies fussing] [sea bird calling] [wind chimes ringing] Aren't they gorgeous? Yeah. Do you want to hold one? Come on. Alright. Sure. -Come on. -Which one? Take him. Yes. Ohh... -Got it? -Yeah. [chuckles] Roxanne... this is Mrs. Griffin, the boys' nanny. -Hi. -Mrs. Pulitzer. It's nice to meet you. [Herbert] Mrs. Griffin, why don't you take him? -Sure. -You got him? There we are. Let's put him down over here. -That's Mac. -Mm-hmm. And this is Zac. Oh... -Oh, careful. -Mm-hmm. Okay. They might still be really hungry. Oh, I know what I'm doing, Mr. Pulitzer. Thank you. Roxy. Come on. Let's go. They'll be fine. [baby crying] [babies crying] Sweetheart, the babies are crying. What? I'm gonna get up and help the babies. -Roxy. -Hm? [babies crying] Mrs. Griffin's with the babies. I know... Come on. No, no, no. [babies crying] Come here. Come on. She doesn't need your help. [babies crying] [babies crying] Hi, honey. Mrs. Pulitzer. I came into see if I could calm him down. It's better if I'm alone with them at feeding time. Please, Mrs. Pulitzer. Mrs. Griffin, I don't understand what's so wrong with me -being with my children. -Don't you understand? It's better if one person is taking care of them. Then they won't be agitated or fussy. Just let me do it. You've got to trust me. -Roxanne. Come on. -Please, Mrs. Pulitzer. -Mrs. Griffin knows what's best. -Please. [baby crying] Roxanne, I want us to go to the ranch together in the morning. I want us to spend some time together, just the two of us. Herbert, the babies are only 6 weeks old! Roxanne, listen to me now. You made me a promise! Why can't they come with us? No! No. They're staying here with the nanny. [sad music plays] [thunder crashes] What's the matter? [thunder crashes] I just needed to know I'm still number one. [thunder crashes] Lorraine, I don't know what I'm gonna do about Herbert. Ever since the twins have been born, he's changed so much. It's like he needs so much, you know? Men can be threatened by babies. He just wants to feel he's still your top priority. Oh, I know that. I know. And I try and make him feel that way all the time. But somehow it's just not enough, you know? It's like he's constantly testing me, you know, trying to make me prove to him how much I love him. I don't know. You know what hurts me the most? He won't have anything to do with Mac and Zac. I mean, he won't even hold them. He says it's the nanny's job. [Lorraine] Rox, a lot of men are uneasy around little babies. But as soon as they become their own people, he's gonna make a terrific father. [Roxanne] I hope so. All I want is for us to be a family. You know? [sighs] [chatter and laughter] There's that magic touch. [door opens] Aren't you gonna join us? No, I don't really feel like getting this body into a bathing suit just yet. Better lose all your weight. Dads loves his women thin. In fact, he just complimented me on how thin I am and how great I look in my new bikini. You do look great. Thanks. [door closes] [babies fussing] Sweetheart, it's okay. This is their nap time, Mrs. Pulitzer. Would you please leave the nursery? These are my children. Tell me again what you can or cannot come to this nursery. You seem to think you know so much about babies, Mrs. Pulitzer, when, in fact, you know nothing. Well, I know one thing. I want you out. Go pack your bags right now. Go on. [door closes] [baby fussing] Come here, sweetheart. That was terrific, Roxanne. You must be very proud of yourself. I was getting sick and tired of her telling me what to do all the time! Well, now it's all up to you. You find a new nanny. Just make sure you do it before we go to New York in ten days. [door slams] Jim won't use any other kind. [laughter] You know the same... what they have in Europe. I fired Mrs. Griffin. -No. -I did. Good for you! Yeah, but now Herbert's furious at me. He wants me to hire a new one before we leave for New York. Do you know any? Let's see. I'm sure there's something in here. Look under "N." Yeah. Sure. [both laugh] "N." You're amazing. You know that? [Jacquie] No. Just prepared. He also wants me to throw a dinner party. I don't know where to begin. Well, have your invitations printed out at Cordially Yours. Use only Frank Dale as a caterer. If you need any extra china, linen, or silver, I've got plenty. Also, there's a whole strategy to table sittings, which we'll go over once you make out your guest list. Yes, but who do I invite? That's easy. I not only have the names of anyone who's anybody in Palm Beach... Let's see. I've got the names of their -- their spouses, kids, dogs... -[laughs] Dogs. -Parakeets. Servants. Favorite flower, favorite restaurant, favorite charity, political persuasion, and whose dinner party they've been invited to in the last three seasons. You're crazy. You're absolutely nuts. You know that, don't you? How do you do this? Simple survival in Palm Beach. Mm-hmm. [both laugh] Crazy. [cheers and applause] [Herbert] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What, are you crazy? [laughter] [chatter] -Aah! -Whoa! -Who's up? -[woman] Oh, my turn! [man] Yeah, Roxanne! [cheers and applause] Who are you calling? The kids. Do you think they're asleep? [chuckles] It's 4:00 in the morning. Of course they're asleep. Happy birthday. Who's she? The masseuse. No, don't do that. No. I can't do this. [Herbert] Hmm... Ohh. Roxanne. Please. I want you. I want to see you with another woman. I can't. It's something I want you to do. What about our rule? That it would always be just you and me and that we would always go home together and that you'd never cheat on me. This wouldn't be cheating. We'd both be there. What do we need another woman for? -Aren't I enough? -Oh, Rox, yes, you're enough. You're the most wonderful woman in the world. You're everything I could ever want in a woman. I'm a middle-aged man. All my life, I've had one fantasy -- to be with two women. Do you know you're the first woman I've ever felt close enough to to ask to share that fantasy? It's something that I want to live out. And I want to do it with you. [Roxanne chuckles] You've never given me flowers before. I love you, Roxanne. You know I wouldn't ask you to do something if it wasn't important. Herbert, I do not want to discuss this anymore. I want you to do it. [man] Mrs. Pulitzer? When you have a moment, can I speak to you? [Roxanne] Yeah, sure. I'll be out a minute, okay? Okay. [door closes] Who's that? He's the kids' new swimming teacher. Yeah? He taught Lorraine's kids. Oh. What's he teaching you? Nothing. Yeah? You sure? I bet he's attracted to you. I know what I was like when I was his age. Yeah, but you were married to Lilly, not to me. -Hi. -What are you doing here? [laughs] -Roxy, I need a favor. -What's up? I met someone. -[laughs] -Who? Let's just say that he owns a Major League baseball team. He wants to see me today. He's already sent his jet down. And if I go alone, Joe might get suspicious. Will you come with me? Jacquie, I can't. I just promised the kids I'd be here after their nap. Oh, come on. We'll only be gone a couple hours. I promise we'll be back by the time they're up. Please? I'd do it for you! What'll I tell Herbert? Gosh. Tell Herbert we went shopping. Come on. -Shopping? -Yes, shopping. Jacquie, listen. I don't think you understand. Seriously. He likes me here when he gets home for lunch. -I can't do it. I can't do it. -Come on. Hey, you're the only one who can help me. I'd do it for you. Come on. Thank you. Jacquie... [chatter] [wolf-whistle] [man] Nice pants! [man 2] Come on! Keep your mind on the running! Alright. Alright... [whistle blows] It's 5:00, Jacquie! I told you I wanted to do something with Herbert and the boys tonight! Will you relax? Calm down. We'll be back in plenty of time. Hey! Herbert's really got you where he wants you, doesn't he? No, Herbert doesn't really have me where he wants me. It's where I want to be, okay? Look, I don't know what's going on with you and Jim, but I happen to be in love with Herbert, and I really don't want to blow it, alright? [whistle blows] -Hi, Joyce. -Hi, Mr. Pulitzer. -Where's Roxanne? -She hasn't come in yet, sir. [telephone rings] Yeah? [man] Mr. Pulitzer, I'm at the hangar. Can I speak to you for a moment? You lied to me. You realize that? You lied to me. How am I ever gonna trust you again? I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry. I told her I didn't want to go. I just... I'll never lie to you again. I promise. Damn right you won't. Get in the car. I told her I didn't want to go! Which one do you like? I don't know. By the way, I called an escort service in Miami this afternoon. Two girls are coming to the hotel tomorrow afternoon. [thunder crashes] You're doing this to punish me for going off with Jacquie, aren't you? I told you what I wanted. Alright. I'll find someone. Just give me some time. You told me that months ago, Roxanne. I'm tired of waiting. All men want to do a ménage à trois. They love it. They think it's a big deal. I know, but what worries me is that he's gonna like one of the girls. Well, you're just gonna have to be there to make sure he doesn't. -Jacquie? -Yeah? Will you do me the biggest favor? Please? What? Of course. I'm your friend. What? Will you do it with me? [laughs] Are you serious? [both laugh] I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked. I know. It's ridiculous. But, really, you're the only one I can trust not to fall in love with him. That I can promise you I wouldn't do. He's definitely not my type. Please? For you, Roxy... I'll do it. You will? Yeah. Could we have another bottle of champagne, please? [Jacquie] Please. [Roxanne chuckles] Herbert and I have one rule, Jackie. No tickling? He only has intercourse with me. Oh, how territorial. I mean it, Jacquie. With me only. Fine. You got it. Give me the champagne. [Herbert] We got a hell of a lot of work to do on the SeaHunter. Still got to scrub the hull before next season. The decks. Look at the decks. I'm gonna have to revarnish the decks. So much work to do on boats, you know? You -- You really never come to the end of it. [chuckles] Oh. Hey. Got a little present for you. Eh? Maybe this will help. Hey. [snorts] Jacquie? [Jacquie] No, thank you. [gentle music plays] [laughter] [Herbert] Come back! [Jacquie] Bring us some more champagne! [Herbert] Yeah, more champagne! [Roxanne] Okay. [Herbert laughing] -Alan? -Yes, Mrs. Pulitzer. Could you bring down some more champagne, please? [static] Mrs. Pulitzer. Your champagne. Thank you. Thanks. [Jacquie laughing] [Herbert moans] [Herbert] Oh, yeah. Roxanne? Roxanne! Roxanne! Roxanne! Roxanne! You promised me you wouldn't sleep with her! -I couldn't help it. -How could you do that?! You know, she was -- she was -- I was high. I was turned on. And she was just there. It happened. It's no big deal. No big deal?! No big deal? It's a very big deal! -You're upset. You're upset. -I knew this was a stupid idea! -Next time -- -Next time?! Next time? No! There is not gonna be a next time! Oh, God. What the hell am I gonna tell Jim? Thanks for coming. Roxanne, about the other night... It's not your fault. I never should have agreed to do it. I only did it to please him. Maybe you should try pleasing yourself for a change. [door opens and closes] Where were you? I was at the club with Jacquie. Why? You're lying. You were with someone. I wasn't with anyone. I was at the club with Jacquie. You can call and check if you want. I want you stop seeing her. I'm not gonna stop seeing her. She's my best friend. She's a slut! She's a bad influence on you! I want you to stop seeing her! No! I'm getting tired of you telling me what to do. [dance music playing] [chatter and laughter] [music continues] -Alright. -Where are you going, Herbert? Home! It's only 12:00. We've only been here for an hour. Fine, Roxy. -I want to dance more. -I've had enough, Rox. Let's go. -He wants to leave. -Come on, Rox. I don't want to dance anymore. Come on. Are you coming with me? You're no fun anymore, Herbert. Alright. Roxanne, you stay. You stay. I'll go. But what about our rule, that we'd always go home together? That's up to you, Roxanne. Whatever you want. You're the one that's having a good time. I'm sure you're not gonna have any problems -getting a ride. -Herbert, we'll take her home. -Don't worry. -Are you sure? Yes. You're a big girl now. You can stay. Have fun. Come on. He said have a good time. Let's have a good time. -Come on. Come on. -I better go with him. -Come on. -Let's go! He said have a good time. [music continues] I've been looking for you everywhere. Where the hell were you last night? I want to Greta and Arthur's after the disco closed. And I fell asleep there. You were with Jacquie, weren't you? Hm? And that, uh -- You were with that swimming teacher that you think is so good-looking? I don't know what you're talking about. Come on, Roxanne. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're sleeping with him. Everyone knows it. Sleeping with him? Herbert, I don't know what you're talking about. You're lying, Roxanne. You're lying. How the hell did you get to be such a lying slut? I'm not lying. I'm telling you the truth. Wouldn't know the truth if it sat in your lap. Oh, God. Stop it, Herbert. Not gonna stop it till you admit to me that you're lying. Not gonna admit to you that I'm lying because I'm telling you the truth! Alright. I'm checking you into Highland Park Hospital today. You're a sick drug addict. You need help. Look who's talking. You're the one who buys it all the time. You do it just as much as I do! I mean it, Roxanne. I mean it. You've got to be kidding me. No, I'm not kidding. Come back here, Roxanne. Roxanne, come back here! Roxanne, stop! Don't you ever walk away from me! Stop it! -Don't you walk away from me! Don't you ever walk away from me when I'm talking to you! How many men are you sleeping with, huh, Roxy? How many men? Or women. Are you sleeping with any women? Stop it! No! Are you sleeping with Arthur and Greta?! [indistinct shouting] Roxy, you're gonna go to that hospital... No! I am not going! Because I am not sick! -No! Stop it! -Do what I tell ya! [Roxanne screaming] Stop it! -You like this? -No! Huh? Is this what you want to do to me? No! [sobbing] Herbert, be still. [Herbert groans] I'll go! I'll go! [Roxanne sobbing] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [Dr. Kahn] The staff and I have just been reviewing your case, Mrs. Pulitzer, and we've concluded that you're what we would call a social abuser of cocaine and alcohol. You have a problem, but you're not an addict, no, not yet. But if you continue using drugs, even occasionally, socially, you will become an addict. You may think you can control it, but you won't be able to. And if you continue abusing drugs, it will become a far more serious problem. I'm sorry. We can't keep you in this hospital. We need the limited number of beds that we have for those with more serious problems. Dr. Kahn, she's got a serious problem. What are we supposed to do about it? I suggest the two of you go for some counseling and try to confront your wife's problems together. Lied to him, didn't you? You didn't tell him everything. Of course I did, Herbert. I told him that I snorted cocaine occasionally, socially, and that I drink champagne a couple times a week... but that that was it. Occasionally? Socially? I'm never gonna do cocaine again, alright? Herbert, maybe we ought to get some counseling like Dr. Kahn suggested, get some help. We don't need any more counseling. Look, I am just trying to save our marriage, alright? And I feel like if we get together, we can solve this problem. We have to confront this! Yeah, Dr. Khan is right. We need to confront this problem. I'm gonna do something about it. Herbert, things are gonna get better, alright? Would you just relax? Alright... [engine starts] [tires screech] [Roxanne] He even accused me of being attracted to younger men. Come on. That's pretty natural. I mean, especially when your wife is 20-some years younger than you. [Roxanne] Why won't he believe me when I tell him he's the only man I'm attracted to? [Lorraine] Honey, you've just got to keep reassuring him. Lorraine, he's scaring me. [Lorraine] Listen. Why don't you and the boys stay for lunch? [Roxanne] I can't. Really. I got to go. He likes me home for lunch, you know. Really, he hates it when I'm late. Mac! Zac! Come on, honey. Let's go. [man] Your husband would like you to sign this. It's a post-marital agreement. -[Roxanne] What's that? -Well, should the marriage end, it gives you full custody of the children. And Herbert also agrees to provide you with a house and to give you $3,000 a month in child support, notwithstanding the cost of their education, special interests, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. How long have you been thinking about this, Herbert? I'd like you to sign it today if you would. It says here that... once I sign this, all Herbert would have to do is file for divorce... and that I wouldn't have any -- any say in it. Is that right? [man] That's correct. And in your own legal opinion, do you feel that I should sign this? Well, honestly, I think you should hire a lawyer and let him look at it. If it's no big deal, then why are you insisting I sign it? [breathing sharply] Because... I'm scared. Okay? If you really want to know. Because I'm scared. Because... Things are all different between us because you're different. Sometimes I don't -- I don't feel like I know you, and I'm scared that you're gonna want somebody else. There's nobody else. I love you. Roxy, if you love me, sign it. Sign it. Come on. It's a good deal. It's a good deal for you, too, you know? It protects you in case I run off with somebody else. Is there somebody else? Roxy, please. Just -- Here. Sign it. Come on. [sighs] I just can't sign something that makes it so easy for you to end things between us. It's not over. Roxy, who said anything about over? Don't you love me anymore? You're being childish. What are you doing? I'm moving onto the boat. -What?! -[sighs] Sign the agreement. I can't sign the agreement! And you know I can't sign the agreement! Then I'm moving onto the boat. [scoffs] "And the princess's eyes fluttered as she stirred. And the king and queen came hurrying into the room and --" Thank you. "And kissed the princess. They thanked the handsome prince for rescuing them from the wicked fairy's spell. And as for the prince, he was very happy. He decided he would marry the most beautiful princess in all the world. And they lived happily ever after." Do you guys have any idea how much I love you? More than the moon and the sky. [child fusses] And the stars. [chatter] Good to see you, Mark. [Herbert] I'm glad you decided to come, Roxanne. Alright, everybody. Let's get started. Who wants to start this week? I'll go if you want. -Okay... Most of you already know my story. Uh... My wife, Roxanne... is an incorrigible drug addict. She lied her way out of the hospital that -- I'm at my wit's end. I don't know what to do about her. I just hope that she's here for herself and not because she thinks that by coming here that she can get me back, because it's becoming increasingly clear to me that our marriage is over. Hope you know what you're doing, Pete. As I understand it, people come to group therapy to get help, not to be lured here under false pretenses. I came here with my best intentions. I really did. But, um... it's quite obvious to me... that I am being set up. Screw you, Herbert Pulitzer. Okay? Screw all of you. [knocking] [Jacquie] Joyce! Miss Jacquie! She's in her room. She's been in there all day! [knocking] -The door is locked. -Roxy! Open up, honey. -It's okay. Go sit down. -Okay. Thanks for calling me. Roxanne? Hi, honey. Herbert's filing for divorce. And he wants custody over the boys. What?! [sobbing] He doesn't care about those kids. Roxanne, you've got to get a lawyer. When a man like Pete Pulitzer makes up his mind, that's it. There's no turning back. I don't want a divorce. It doesn't matter what you want! He's a Pulitzer, and this is Palm Beach. Hello? Yes. Is Mr. Farish there? Are you sure that we're not putting too much emphasis -[Roxanne] on the money? -[Farish] I told you, this is not a child custody battle. Pete Pulitzer doesn't want those kids. He doesn't want to lose his money. Custody's just a bargaining chip. Here. Fill this out. What is it? We're filing for emergency financial support. Say he cut off your credit. Can't buy groceries. Can't get gasoline for the car. About how much you think you and the kids need each month to live in your present circumstances? We could probably get by on $2,000 a month. [Farish] Ah, that's much too low. Average court awards 1/3 of what you ask for. You want 4 grand, you got to say 12. You know, I could care less about the money. I really could. I just don't want to lose my children. Alright. Alright. See who you can round up for character witnesses. [Roxanne] Lorraine, I feel like I have the Black Plague. You know, some of the twins' playmates aren't even allowed to play with them any more. The other day the club, Greta couldn't even look me in the eye. What about Jacquie? I tried call-- I've tried calling her at least half a dozen times. She won't return my calls. [sighs] You're the only friend I have left. I tried to warn you. You don't know the rules of the game. You never have. What game? Jacquie, I'm coming to you as a friend. A friend. Look, this is how it is here. You're either on the inside or the outside. You're out now. I couldn't help you even if I wanted to, Roxanne. Jacquie, Herbert can't get those kids! I'm their mother. You have to help me. You still don't get it, do you? In Palm Beach, when your marriage is over, you're over. [smooches] Take care, Roxy. Thank you. Your Honor, witnesses are going to come into this courtroom and tell you that Roxanne Pulitzer is a pathologic, inveterate, irrepressible, and continuous liar -- in addition to that, that she is an adulteress, that she experimented in lesbian relationships. Pete Pulitzer lived in a way he's never lived before and hasn't lived since with this woman. He took drugs so he could stay up until 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning to accommodate his wife's desires for the bright lights, loud music, and disco scene. We believe and respectfully submit that when this case is tried, Mr. Pulitzer will end up with permanent custody of these children. Thank you. I told you he wants custody of the kids. He's just bluffing. Mr. Hollister, are you a member of the same group therapy as Pete Pulitzer, the group led by Ed McCabe? -[Hollister] I am. -[Randy] And were you there on the day that Roxanne Pulitzer visited that group? I was. [Randy] Would you say that she acted unduly agitated or extremely irrational on the occasion of this event? Objection. Leading the witness. [Judge Harper] Sustained. Mr. Hollister, will you tell us what Roxanne said to the group that afternoon? Well, the gist of it i-- she'd felt she'd been set up somehow. Suddenly, she yelled, "Screw you, Herbert Pulitzer. Screw all of you." Then she walked out. [Judge Harper] Witness is excused. [TV newscaster] In our feature story, Herbert Pulitzer, the grandson of the late publishing magnate Joseph Pulitzer, has filed suit for divorce from Roxanne. The trial, which began last week, has included charges and countercharges... Hi, guys. Look, Mommy, come here. ...lesbianism, adultery, and ménage à trois sex. I don't want you guys to watch TV for a while. I want to see -- No! I said no. [music playing] I'm sorry. Come here. Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. How can I explain this to you guys if I can't even explain it to myself? Hmm? We would always be together. Right, Mommy? Of course. Of course. We're always going to be together. I promise you. Can I have a hug? Can I have a hug? Yeah. I promise. I promise. She was jealous of me. [Scott] Why was she jealous of you? [Liza] She was jealous of anybody that was close to Dad. His family, his friends, my sister, me. [Scott] Well, can you explain to the judge then, why, if you didn't get along with her and she didn't get along with you, she would ask you to have a sexual relationship with her? I can only say that possibly she was attracted to me physically. [Judge Harper] You may step down. Did there come a time in your relationship with Mrs. Pulitzer when you'd spend a great deal of time with her one on one in the house till the early hours of the morning, talking? Possibly. [Scott] Tell me, have you ever had sexual intercourse, in a lesbian way, with Roxanne Pulitzer? No. [Scott] Have you ever been in the first-floor bedroom in a bed located in that bedroom naked with Roxanne Pulitzer, who was also naked at the same time? You're disgusting. [Scott] Will you answer the question, please? No. [Walker] It was late one night, and, um, I heard giggling coming from the cabin. And I knew it was Miss Pulitzer 'cause I'd seen her go in there earlier. And around 10:30, she called me and asked me to bring her a bottle of champagne. Her third bottle. And when I brought it to her, she came out in a bathrobe, and a friend of hers was in the bed, a naked lady friend. [Randy] And do you know who this woman was, the naked woman that you saw? Yes, I do. It's Jacquie Kimberly. [Randy] No further questions. And have you ever known Mrs. Pulitzer to stay out all night? Yes. [Scott] Have you ever known her to take illegal drugs? Yes. Thank you. Do you love Herbert Pulitzer? I will always hold a special love for Herbert, because he's the father of my children. Well, in what way has he shown his love for you and for the children? [music playing] I think that Herbert's shown his love for us by this lawsuit. [Scott] Now, ma'am, you have heard Dr. Alameda describe that your husband was in the position of master and you were in the position of servant. Can you help this court understand what he meant by this? [music playing] Well, I don't want to put the blame on Herbert totally. Because obviously, I went along with it. It's just -- I would have done anything this man wanted me to do. We'll take a brief recess. I thought I could keep going another two or three months. Maybe we can struggle through this thing somehow, someway. Do you love your wife now? No. Are there any circumstances, Pete, under which you would ever be able to live with her again in the relationship of husband and wife? Never. [Scott] Pete, now tell the court, why would a person such as you subject themselves to the kind of exposure, publicity that you've been subjected to in this case? [music playing] Because I want my children. [Scott] I have no further questions. Your witness, Mr. Farish. Mrs. Pulitzer, it's so quiet. I miss the boys. Me, too. But they love going to the ranch. How could I say no? [woman] Mrs. Pulitzer? Telephone. Who is it? Mr. Farish's office. The judge has made his decision. They want you back in court. [music playing] [reporter] There she is! [reporters clamoring indistinctly] [music playing] [Judge Harper] In the matter of Pulitzer vs. Pulitzer, I find that custody of the children of this marriage shall be awarded to their father, Herbert Pulitzer. The mother of the children shall have visitation rights as follows -- four weeks during summer vacation and two weekends a month the rest of the year. As for the division of the property of the parties, the wife shall have the $20,000 Porsche, $60,000 in jewelry, $48,000 in rehabilitative alimony, $7,000 cash equity in the husband's boat... [music playing] My babies. I lost my babies. [sobs] [music playing] [car horns honking in distance] [children shouting indistinctly in distance] Roxy, you've got to eat something. I'm not hungry. Please. You haven't eaten anything in two days. You want to stay strong for Mac and Zac, don't you? Well, why don't you just move away from Palm Beach, just -- Lorraine, I'm not going anywhere until I get my boys back. I'm going to appeal the judge's decision. I'm gonna stay here and fight for them until I get them back. Okay. Okay. [manager] Have you ever taught aerobics? No, I haven't. But, I mean, I've been taking classes for years, I practically know the routines in my sleep. I'm sorry, I need an experienced teacher. Come on. Just let me teach one class. Just give me one chance. Please. I really need the job. Okay, okay. -[Roxanne] Yeah? -[manager] Yeah. But if you don't cut it, no second chances. No, that's fine. -[manager] Okay. -When can I start? Right now. Great. Thanks. Thank you. Okay, breathe. [exhales deeply] Again. [exhales deeply] And shoulders back. 2. Well, what do you think? Where's -- I don't see any toys. Well, we're going to get some. And what do you think that is? A tent? Wow! Oh, yeah. Oh, yes. Wow, pillows? [Roxanne] Oh, it's so nice to see you guys. [smooching] [siren wailing in distance] Alright. Where's Mac? What's the matter, Mac? You lied to me. You said that we would always be together. Mac. Mommy loves you. Then why did you lie to me? I didn't mean to lie to you. [music playing] I never meant to hurt you. You're my baby. You're my baby. [smooches] Hey, guys, I'm hungry. Hungry? Hungry? Okay. Well, let's go eat. What do you want to eat? Um, hamburgers. Hamburgers? Okay. Maybe we'll get a movie, too. Wait, Mac, what is that? Can I keep it? Of course you can keep it. -[Mac] I got the keys. -[Zac] Got the keys. Okay. Do we have everything? [Mac] Everything. [speaks indistinctly] [Roxanne] 3, 4, 1, 2. [speaks indistinctly] And 1, 2, 3, 4. And again, 2, 3, 4. And 1, knees up, 3, 4. And 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3. [music playing] [Herbert] Hi. Hi. It's a good class. Thanks. Roxy, will you have dinner with me? Please, I -- I want to see you. I miss you. [indistinct conversations] The first day on the job, I was so scared. Well, you were good. I haven't had a workout like that in years. Herbert! Roxanne. Good to see you. Good to see you, Arthur. Greta. [music playing] You know, since we split up, I haven't been able to be with another woman. You? I thought you'd be dating like crazy. No. I'm not interested. [sniffles] Oh. Just come back to the house. spend some time with us. It'll be like old times. Pete, you know that there is nothing I would want more than to come home. For it to be like old times. I know, but just one thing. Drop the appeal, will you? I can't. Roxy, it's such a waste of time and money. I need more visitation rights. [sniffles] I need to see the boys more. Oh, you can see the boys anytime you want. [music playing] Do you mean it? Yes, I mean it, of course. Put it in writing for me. No. Well, then I can't drop the appeal. I'll fight you, Roxy. I'll fight you every time. You're never going to win it. I'm never going to quit. Those are my boys, Herbert. And I'm going to fight for them until I get them. [music playing] [Roxanne] Herbert couldn't accept the fact that I started growing up, thinking for myself, and taking a stand. He wanted me to stay the same, to remain forever that 20-year-old girl that he had first met. [sighs] If I could have, I would have. But that's just not how life works. The way life works is that sometimes you make mistakes that you can't change. But you try to learn from them. And then maybe even learn to forgive. [music playing]
