foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Welcome to FM Sports Radio as we begin our coverage of the Delhi NCR Cup. We are at the end of this legendary prestigious tournament. The final two players who are going to play today belong to Delhi Watford Club and Faridabad Gymkhana. Come on, Delhi. - Come on, Delhi. Come on. - Come on, Delhi. Delhi.. - Faridabad.. Delhi Watford Club, of course, is the defending champion. Their lead player is Reema Bhullar. Very strong and tall. She will be the favourite. Today, Anushka Singh will play against her. Faridabad Gymkhana made into the finals after 18 long years. They have reached the finals after 18 years. Dad, I didn't want to play this tournament. I am going to play it only for your sake. I am missing you a lot, Dad. Please come tomorrow. Dad, it's the finals tomorrow. "Let the sparks fly!" "Make your stand!" "Let the sparks fly with your might!" "Make your stand!" "Who can stop them?" "They are the jack of all trades.." Reema.. Reema.. - "No one can stop.." Anushka.. All the best, Captain. "March ahead. Your destiny.." You'll see, she will win. - Yes. "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny." Faridabad! - Delhi.. Faridabad.. - Delhi.. - When will it begin? There you go. - Do they allow bringing sugar cane inside? Sugar cane is common in Haryana. You should eat it too. Both the players have reached in the middle of the court for the toss. Anushka will give the contestant from Delhi a tough competition. She will play so well that the people of Delhi will be shocked. Heads. Ladies and gentlemen, Reema has won the toss. - Sir. So, I will take this side. - She has decided to serve. Okay. - People from Delhi always win. It doesn't matter to which team their opponents belong. Hey, natives of Faridabad! Quit tennis and start playing 'Gilli Danda'. Come on, Delhi! Both the players are ready for a warm-up session. Delhi's team won the first match. Then Faridabad's team won. Then Delhi's team won. I am sure that Faridabad will win this match. You can bet if you want. You are so smart. Why don't you join NASA? Today's match is very special. Our selectors are here and I'm sure that they will be very interested to find out whether any of these two can actually play for the country in the future. I can feel that it is going to be a very exciting match. Just wait and watch. Your team, Faridabad, will lose. Don't think like that, Delhi snob. The match hasn't even started yet. Reema's serve looks very confident and strong. And she is not losing her targets at all. On the other side, Anuskha's serves are neither confident nor accurate. I hope she recovers soon. Reema will teach her a lesson. How will she play? She can't even see. Give your spectacles to her. This game needs not only bodily tactics but also some intelligence. Focus. This game needs not only bodily tactics but also some intelligence. It's very important to hold our serve and break the opponent's serve. Come on.. What are you doing, Anushka? Come on. High toss.. Good! Shape into it, come on! Come on.. Good.. Come on.. Still, you are not playing to your full potential. Such sessions are of no use, Anushka. You won't be able to handle the good players even for one set. You have to get better. Give more power.. Especially, while serving. Javed, give her one more basket full of balls so that she can serve from the ad court. Really, 200 balls from the ad court! And 200 balls from the deuce court. And 100 more balls. Today, she will die. More topspin. More topspin on the second serve. Be energetic. From tomorrow, we'll practice for three instead of two hours. Okay. - And no rest. Okay? You must focus more, Anushka. This is just not enough. You have to gather points in the ITA tournaments and then, in the ITF circuit. You have to become the world's number one player. Okay. - You must do things what other Indians couldn't. 'Last forty to do.' Here you go. Eat it. - Mom, enough. What do you mean? Though you didn't eat even a single piece you're saying, 'Enough'. You must eat at least five such pieces to stay strong. Are you trying to turn me into a Phogat sister? I have an idea. I will quit tennis and join wrestling. Anushka Phogat. How does it sound? Shut up. Mom, look at this. This leg piece looks like a tennis racket. Oh, God! What's wrong with you? Tomorrow, if I make 'Dum Aloo' you will say that it looks like a ball. How will you eat them? Mom, after working hard all through the day I feel like resting and not eating food. You become really tired, right? That's nothing. My daughter is a strong girl. Once we win the tournament, we will go on vacation. I have already confirmed it with the ONGC guest house in Kullu. We will go there even if she doesn't win. What do you mean? No, it was a random thought. No one can stop my daughter from winning. I won't allow her to lose. If we prepare hard with focus and discipline we can reach a position where no one ever has. I am talking about making Anushka a champion. The world champion. Do you get it? Okay? Oh! This is known as playing well. Anushka, why did you choose this shop? We can get all the items here. Everything in one place. - Welcome, ma'am. I need a sports T-shirt. Please come. Please. Mom. Show me. - Here you go. It's good. Oh, Reema. Ma'am, please see these. I will be back in a minute. What happened to him? Welcome, ma'am. These shirts are so tacky. Don't you have anything else? Yes, ma'am. What's your budget? - Don't worry about that. Just show me. Sure. - Do you know her? Reema Bhullar. She is a famous player. Delhi's number one player. Have you ever played against her? No. Right now, we are ready for the action. It's going to be a very exciting match. Anushka is like Tendulkar. - Yes. She doesn't talk much but plays well. But I must say that Reema is no less. Reema's amazing backhand cross-court winner. And this time, it's a forehand winner. Well, she doesn't have stability. The score is 30 to 0. What a clean ace! Reema has started dominating from the first game. I had warned you guys not to take her. She will win. Just wait and watch. She will win. "Gang.." He didn't find the love letter that she sent him. Do you know why? - Why? Because he never opened that book. Shall I crack another joke? - Go inside. Come, we have to play tennis. Yes, let's go immediately. Hello, come and practice with us too. Pal, would you like to serve? Captain, I am not in a mood now. I will throw this ball at your face. Break it. I can get a better face through plastic surgery. Guys, start now. How long are you planning to warm-up? What are you doing, Anushka? That's not how you should play. Be clear about which shot you want to play. If you want to dominate the opponent you must choose the shot based on the opponent's shot. Come on. Hey! What kind of a shot was that? Chip shot? It is a useless shot. Forget about it. Okay? Dad, that happens automatically. Nothing happens automatically. A thought process takes place behind everything. Stick to your strengths. The tournament is nearing. Stick to the basics. Okay. Go, attend the service from the baseline. Don't try to come forward. Go. Anushka! What happened? - Dad, my toe. Move your hand away. Let me check. Remove this too. Here? Here? - Yes. Is it painful? - Yes. Don't worry. You will be all right. I will be back. Go, give her the first aid box. Pal. Apply this. Hold it.. Are you feeling better? I am still in pain. Let me call the physiotherapist. I don't want you to enter the tournament with injuries. What happened, dear? I got injured. Are you experiencing severe pain? Yes. - Doctor, it's Dilip. Yes. Hello. Actually, Anushka is experiencing pain in her leg again. Yes, on her toe. Okay, thank you. I will bring her right now. Slowly. Today, she will become Serena Williams for sure. Quick, sir. Or else, you'll be late for Wimbledon. They have a plan. First, they will occupy the court. Then they will build a mall here. Excuse me, sir. We have been waiting for long. Can't you see that we are practising? Wait. That's what we have been doing. You can make your daughter play Wimbledon later. Please let us practice for the Inter-Club Competition. Even we have paid to play here. My father works for others all day and night and earns money for my survival. Hey! How many times should I say? - Dad. Can't you see that we are practising? Leave. I'll beat up you guys severely. What happened? Why are you creating a ruckus? Sir, we have been waiting to play for a long time. When will we play, if they play all day long? Also, the second court is under repair. Mr. Dilip, please adjust for today. Please understand. Don't make her practice for such a long time. It's okay that you're practising but there must be some benefit at least. Even coal turns into a diamond after so much of effort. We can decide that once the Under-14 tournament is over. Also, we have 15 minutes left. Mr. Dilip, sportsman spirit is also important. As I am the secretary of the sports club I request you to give them the half court. Let them practice a little. Let them learn. That's about it. Kanda, my daughter is preparing for the Under-14 tournament. She needs practice. This game is just a timepass for them.. It's not a timepass for them. They practice hard. They are representing our club in the Delhi NCR Inter-Club Tennis Tournament. Oh! You remember the Inter-Club Tournament, don't you? My bad. How could I ask you such a silly question? No one can forget their bad experiences. Kids, you can take the half court. If anyone stops you tell them that you have permission from the management. But we have 15 minutes.. This is my final decision. Come on. Play. All of you, practice. Come, Anushka. We will shift you to a better club. Anyway, it is a useless club. They have no respect for their top players. Dad, why do you take everything so seriously? You could have allowed them to play. They are also preparing for a tournament. Don't lecture me. I know their attitude. Do you think that they are serious about it? They are just wasting their parents' money. The game needs dedication. Those who are not serious, shouldn't play at all. At least, you're serious about it. I have great plans for you. I will send you to Nick Bollettieri academy. Dad, please. Don't you know how expensive it is? It's one of the best institutions for tennis coaching in the world. It's too expensive. I don't want to go to any such place. I can't get a better coach than you. Yes. Out. No, sir. It was in. Okay. Did she just do that? Why? Congrats. All right, ladies and gentlemen. We have come to the end of the National Under-14 championship for girls. And the winner for 2016 is none other than Reema Bhullar. - Wow! The first runner up award goes to Payal Agarwal. You were playing a professional match. You shouldn't have interrupted linesman's decision. The second runner up award goes to Vijaytha Singh. There is a special award for a special gesture. Special award for sportsmanship goes to Anushka Singh. Wow! She showcased an ideal character by herself overruling a breakpoint. Anushka lost the quarter-finals. But she won the hearts of her fans and organisers with her good behaviour. Dad? Dad.. Listen to one thing very carefully, Anushka. I want to see you holding the trophy which you will get by winning the match not the trophy that you got because of your good behaviour. This is not only your defeat. It's my defeat too. Though I lost, I won a trophy, didn't I? Playing fairly is also important, right? Life was not fair to him. He could have reached heights if there was no politics and if some people didn't exist. He couldn't succeed but he wants to see you succeed. You are the best. Your father and I know that very well. It's not just about me. It's about him. What's wrong with him? He lost the first set in the Inter-Club Tournament and got injured in the second set. No, sir. Nothing happened to him. He is acting. He holds his toe unnecessarily when he begins to lose. He has no stamina at all. He is a runaway.. Wait and watch. He will escape now. Kanda defamed him by addressing him as a runaway. Kanda was very jealous of Dilip. He made sure that Dilip never plays any tournament. He knew the association's president. Gradually, Kanda made him take away all the facilities. Coaches were ordered not to focus on Dilip's training. Davis Cup's selectors refused to select Dilip in the last minute. Dilip could never recover from that shock. Now, you are his only hope. Perhaps, whatever he is doing to you is wrong. But his intention is not wrong. I can surely say that about him. Let us remind you that Reema had won against her in the quarter-finals of the Under-14 National Championship. This happened three months back. Reema defeated Anushka very easily. As expected, Reema Bhullar, after a very strong start.. Come on, Anushka.. - You can do it. - Come on.. Buck up.. Come on! All the best. One more incredible cross-court winner. We'll lose because of Anushka. - Please. Reema's luck is also supporting her today. By winning this last point, Reema won the first set by 6-3. Oh, God! I wish Dilip were here. Anushka couldn't do much in the first set. Reema Bhullar won the first set by 6-3. Anushka is unable to compete with Reema. She will have to pull up her socks very quickly if she and Faridabad Gymkhana wants to win the trophy. Dilip. Dilip, wake up.. What happened? - Anushka is not in her room. I went to give her milk. But she is not there. - What? Anushka.. Anushka! - Anushka! "This dream is not only yours." "It belongs to those who are dear to you too." "This isn't a burden on your shoulders." "This is your aim." "Come forth. Forget your pain." "Move towards success!" Dad, I will do whatever you want me to do. "The fire in your eyes.." "The storm in your gaze.." "They will never be tired." "They are the companions of the flood of courage." "Fan your passion and fuel your determination." "Keep improving yourself every single moment!" "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny." "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny." Okay, I'll talk to you later. I heard that your daughter won a trophy in the previous match. The whole club is talking about your expectations from your daughter. You want her to play in the Wimbledon and for India too. Mister, no one ever got selected for playing Wimbledon just because they won a fair play trophy. Why are you trying to defame tennis? You have already defamed it once. Are you not satisfied with that? Dad, calm down. Sir, understand one thing very clearly. I know the reason why my dad couldn't play for India. Understand one more thing. Anushka Dilip Singh will surely play for India and add to Faridabad's glory. And you'll witness all of that. Let's go, Dad. Hey, Arvind, stop it. Someone make him understand. What are you doing? - Yes, I don't know swimming. Wow! - Champions. You guys are enjoying a lot. Don't you guys want to practice? You guys didn't win even one match this year. You couldn't even defeat Palwal's team! Don't laugh. It's a shameful fact. I feel that this time, I must make you compete against a local team. We won't lose this time, sir. Yes, sir. We'll reach at least the third round for sure. You don't even think about winning. People should know about their capabilities. You don't even deserve to be on the team. You'll be expelled from the team this time. Did you guys read DLTA's letter? One female contestant must be present in this year's Inter-Club Tournament. What! - That's compulsory. You guys are lucky that we can add a guest female player for the first year. Or else.. Sir, that's not needed. Let's include Anushka. Captain, come here. Boy, listen to me carefully. If Anushka plays from your team you won't be the captain anymore. I guarantee you that. - But.. You can get it in writing from me. How can you take away my captaincy? I have been the captain for the past two years. And the team lost both the tournaments. Anushka is a better player than you. No, sir. No girl can play better than me. My duty was to warn you. So, I warned you. Now, it's up to you. Sir. But now.. Do as I say. Don't include her in your team. Do you get it? Leave the rest to me. Go and swim. Mom, would you like to have a bite? It's really tasty. You like only such weird things. This is 'Insalata Caprese', not a weird thing. It's healthy and good too. I can't even pronounce its name. Have it. You'll reach the Italian Open as you're eating an Italian dish. Then let's visit American restaurants hereafter. Then I can reach the US Open straightaway. You're right. Find an American restaurant for her. Dilip, how are you? Oh! Greetings, sir. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Can I talk to you for a few minutes? Did I disturb your dinner? No.. Not at all. Tell me. How should we handle DLTA's new rule? What can I do, Mr. Kaushik? You're the club's president. So, tell me what I should do. Look, if Anushka plays, she will win for sure. Not only her, but we will win too. The minute I got to know about the association's new rule I thought about Anushka. Moreover, I can't consider anyone else when we have such a talented player with us. Mr. Kaushik, I respect you a lot. You have done a lot for me. I could play tennis as you supported me. I am a member of the club only because of you. Enough.. I expected only this from you. Let's go and have sweets. And let's give this good news to Anushka. You misunderstood me, Mr. Kaushik. I don't want Anushka to play in any team tournament. Anushka is a singles player and she must focus on that. I don't want to destroy her career by putting her in a team event. Sorry. Listen, Dilip, even you know very well that Inter-Club Tournaments are very important. All the selectors attend such tournaments. She will get great exposure. Moreover, all the great players play doubles and team tournaments too. You're right but I don't want Anushka to do that. She will concentrate only on her singles. Are you bothered about politics? What? No. I won't allow any politics to affect Anushka. I promise. I am bothered only about her game. Look, Mr. Kaushik, I am really thankful to you for considering Anushka. But your wish can't come true. Sorry. I am getting late. Goodbye. Dad, where were you? The food is getting cold. Mr. Kaushik was asking if you were interested in playing the Inter-Club Tournament. I denied. Take your seat. "Oh, baby!" "Oh, baby.." "This girl is blowing me away." "Oh, baby!" "This girl is blowing me away." "Oh, baby.." Guys, did Kanda get her to make her our partner? I'll play the mixed doubles for sure. Mr. Kanda has asked me to take care of her. Let me go and check how talented she is. Oh, my God! Keep it low.. S-Sorry. No problem. Keep it low. Inside the court. A little inside. Inside the court. A little bit. Okay? - Okay. Okay.. What is this? Sorry. - Swing it.. Yes. Exactly. Oh, my! Oh! We are in trouble. Stop.. I am really tired. "Oh, baby!" - I think we should take a break. Sure. I'll be back. Can you hold this for me? Sure. - Thank you. Pal, we'll lose if she plays. Hey, she has a little problem in swinging. I'll help her with that. Otherwise, she plays incredibly. Am I right, Arjun? She walks exactly like Sharapova. What about the game? Listen, we can definitely make her do a little better. I will work on her, pal. Please don't worry. This time, we will win for sure. Twinkle, have something more. No, I already had 1877 calories. What? 1877 calories? - Now, I can have nothing other than my dinner. That value is too precise. Don't you think so? You won't understand. One must be precise if he or she wants to be on top. You're right. Learn something from her. Twinkle, your volley is too good. Yes, seriously. Isn't it? Are you guys making fun of me? No.. - Yes, you guys are teasing me. No, Twinkle. I know that I don't play well. But I know that volley is a part of volleyball. Not tennis. It was a mistake. Sorry. Sorry, Dad. Son, you're not at all helping me today. Sorry, Dad. Your mother will teach me a lesson if I fail to prepare a good chicken dish. Give me some coriander leaves. Okay. Just a minute. So, how is your practice going on? It's going on well. Did you guys find a girl? We did find one girl. That's good. How is she? Bad. Then find another one. She is Mr. Kanda's relative. Is Kanda doing corruption? Mom, please don't create an issue. You start doing your NGO job everywhere. Why? What is wrong is wrong. People like Kanda ruin the club. Even Mr. Kaushik was criticising her game. Mom, please. I shouldn't discuss anything with you. Call all your friends. I'll talk to them. Mom, no. - Call them tomorrow. Guys, please don't bother if my mother says anything. Sure, we consider your mother as our mother. Mom! - Guys. Come. - So, the situation has become so serious. Okay, we'll go there and protest if needed. Okay. There she is. - Hello, everyone. Hi. - Hello, ma'am. - Hi. Hello, ma'am. Where is Arvind? Mom, he is with Twinkle. Arvind. - Yes? I want to practice how to return serve. Okay. Sure. Dhruv told me that the new girl is not good. No, she plays well. Don't you like her game? "Oh, baby.." - Oh! Please serve slowly. Okay. - Slow. This is too far. She plays incredibly, ma'am. One day, she will win the Nobel Prize. Nobel Prize! Yes, a Nobel Prize for playing tennis. Shall we rally? - Yes. Oh, my God. Don't you guys have an alternative? Mom, we do have. Anushka. She is good. - Yes, she is good, ma'am. Ma'am, he has gone crazy. Her father is a cannibal. He fries human beings and eats them. Who is Anushka? Is she Dilip Singh's daughter? Sir, we want to talk to you for a second. Move away. - Sir. - Go and ask.. You go. Dhruv, please go. - Me? - Please.. Go, pal. Hey, go.. - Okay, I'm going. Hello, sir. I apologise for the other day. I want to talk to you. Just for two minutes. Sir, we want Anushka to play along with us. We can win the trophy. Sir! Sir, please. Sir. Sir, please listen to us. - Sir! - Sir! Oh, God! - He is upset. All this happened because of you. He is crazy. He never listens to anyone. Why don't you guys talk to his daughter? And I am sure, she will love to play with you guys. Mom, she doesn't even look at us. She is too focused on her tennis. Yes. - You guys are going to talk about tennis, right? Talk to her. If you guys are serious about this I am sure that she will agree. Atul, will you go or you are planning to sit longer? Yes, pal. Do something. Okay. I will go. Hold it. What do you think? Will he get beaten up or he will succeed? He will succeed. Sorry, sir.. Sorry. - It's okay.. Hey, what are you doing there? - Sir.. Got it. 9160368.. Your shoulders pain every day. You are getting old. How do you know that I am not lying? Come on. Sleep. No, sleep right now. You have to go to practice tomorrow morning. I'll come in two minutes. Log out from your Gmail account. You forget that usually. It's no fun without Arvind. He is teaching his friend how to play tennis. Leave it. Call up Anushka. - You call her up. Why should we do all the work? Exactly. - Okay, I'll call her up. Calm down. Give me the phone. - Here you go. Hello.. Mr. Dilip attended the phone call. You got Mr. Dilip's phone number! You never do anything properly. - Nonsense! Hold your mobile phone. - Pal, sorry. Don't miss your practice even for a day when I'm away. I won't miss the practice, Dad. I am your daughter. - Good. Take care of your mother. Ask her to take care of me. She is going to make me fat by making me eat chicken. It's called healthy, not fat. I heard everything. Eating so much of food won't make one healthy. It makes people dull. Anyway, I have downloaded Sania's diet plan. We will follow that from tomorrow onwards. I don't need Sania's diet plan to know what I should feed my child. Tell her that only a mother knows about what is good for her child. I have kept the soap and toothbrush in this. Don't forget to bring these back. I know about your body and what you should eat. Don't laugh. I know everything. Drink the tea before it gets cold. He didn't come for practice today. I have no clue where they are practising. Pal, now only we can make our club win. We? Then? Do you think that we can't win? Be positive, guys. The other day you were saying that one must be aware of one's capabilities. Hey, capabilities grow with time, right? Hi, Anushka. Hi. - The Inter-Club Tournament is nearing. Yes. - Will you play with us? Please. No, thanks. I really need to concentrate on my singles. Okay. Dhruv. Yes! Come on, Dhruv. One more. Sir, what happened? Are you okay? It's paining badly. - This region? - Yes. Okay. Please stand. I will take the racket. Please come, sir. Excuse me. Shall we play a set? Sure. Good job. - Yes! Wow! - Wonderful! Come on. Hit. Yes! - Well played, Anushka. - Thanks. What is this, Chaudhary? It was your shot. I made them win. Friends? Friends. Yes. - Yes. Patience. I am coming. Hi, Mom. - Hello. You must be very tired. Actually, I feel fresh. How did your practice go? It was fun. What happened? Nothing. It's been a while since I heard that word from you. I felt good. Come on, Mom. This is our 'bro-pad'. - Nice. Usually, we don't bring anybody here. But now we are friends, so.. Does that make me a 'bro'? Yes, bro! Wow! This is an awesome view. - Yes. Bringing you here means that you are officially a part of our group now. - Yes. But to be in our gang, everybody has to take an oath. Darn.. We live for the gang. - We live for the gang. We die for the gang. - We die for the gang. We play for the.. That was a good try. What! You're a friend now. Forget it, pal. This girl isn't playing. Correct. I'm not playing. Come on. Perhaps, we will have to play with Twinkle. Twinkle? She plays well. She.. - Hey! Take it easy. Don't fall off the cliff even if you're not playing. Thanks. A new joke on the landlord of Faridabad. - Say it. A girl told him to climb a tree and she'll give him Rs. 1000. Okay. - He climbed the tree and the girl ran off without paying him. Hey.. These days, Arvind is also sitting on that tree. "Twinkle twinkle little star!" - Twinkle.. I'll beat you. Stop beating him. Stop slogging out at this age, sir. The court will get dirty. - I'm not doing this for you but for Anushka. I voluntarily clean this tennis court so that Anushka doesn't face any problem. Her effort is unmatched. Even my daughter wanted to become a tennis player. But before she could even practice poverty took a toll on her. Whenever I see Anushka, I remember my daughter. I couldn't see my daughter becoming successful but I want to see Anushka win. By the grace of God she should make this city and her father proud. May God give her success and not poverty like my daughter. How are you, dear? I am fine. Now, I would like to call on stage one of our brightest talent Anushka Singh, who reached the quarter-final of National Under-14 and bagged the fair play trophy. So, let's welcome Anushka and give her a big hand. Please. Ma'am, your daughter is very bright and I am sure that she will go places. We have high expectations from Anushka. One should have. The girl has talent. But the talent is being wasted. She isn't playing for our club where she comes daily for the practice. She won't play for her school if she isn't playing for the club. She emulates her father. Always take the shortcut. Make some excuses. - Sir, you can't say that. Girl, you must talk to your elders respectfully. Didn't you teach her that? Respect. Education isn't everything. One should have manners. Ma'am, their family is a bunch of losers. They belong to no one. Neither to this city nor to the club. They are selfish. - Sir. - Anushka.. Mom, let me talk. - Let's go. Come. Didn't I say that they are cowards? It's evident. Look at them. Excuse me, sir. You may call us names, but the stark truth is that Dilip was a better player than you and will be one forever. In one game, you were an expert and he was an amateur. Politics. Ma'am, call your husband. I would love to discuss politics with him. You were dumbfounded when Dilip was around. But definitely, behind his back you defamed him. Because of you, his career was ruined. Otherwise, Dilip Singh would have played for India and also the ATP Tournament. Listen carefully to what I have to say. This game isn't over yet. Dilip is only a set down. And Anushka will definitely become the champion. One more thing. We aren't a family of losers. We are survivors. 'Ma'am, their family is a bunch of losers.' 'She emulates her father.' 'Always take the shortcut. Make some excuses.' 'He could have reached heights.' 'Life was not fair to him.' 'I couldn't see my daughter becoming successful' 'but I want to see Anushka win.' 'Their family is a bunch of losers.' 'They belong to no one.' 'They are cowards.' 'By the grace of God' 'she should make this city and her father proud.' 'May God give her success in life.' Dad used to look very smart. See this. Read it. Mom. - Yes. I will take part in the Inter-Club Tournament. I will play for my dad. Call your mom up and inform her that we have lost. We play for the gang. - What? We live for the gang. We die for the gang. And we play for the gang. Yes! Anushka has made a comeback in this set. But now, she is two match points down. Come on! - Another fabulous ace! Anushka, fabulous come back! Oh, God! - What a moment! She has saved one break point with this ace. But she needs to save one more break point to take the game to deuce. Let's see if she can save one more match point or not. Anushka has hit a wonderful cross-court shot. Now, we are at deuce. She has a good chance of taking this game now. She needs two more points. - She hails from Faridabad. She won't give up so easily. At this critical point Reema has made another unforced error. And the second set score is 4-5. Did you see? My theory never goes wrong. Didn't I tell you that the girl from Faridabad will win today? Anushka chips and charges. She rushed to the net and tried to hit a winner. It's a difficult shot. Very few players can play this shot perfectly. Reema has made another unforced error on net. Yes! What a remarkable comeback by Anushka! Anushka has broken Reema's serve and equalised in the second set. The score is five all. She doesn't give up. Mark my words. We will win the trophy. Yes.. What is going on? - She is our new teammate. What! Yes, we were looking for a girl for our team, right? So what? Twinkle is playing, right? The DLTA requires only one girl. Twinkle can't even move properly. How will she play? - And how will she play? I have seen how you were playing doubles. There was no coordination between both of you. Tuning is required for mixed doubles. Twinkle and I have a tuning. Did you get it? I am playing with him for the first time. We need time to have a tuning, right? I don't argue with girls. Twinkle is coming. I want the court to be empty. Arvind! Look, the court won't be empty. We are practising for the Inter-Club Tournament. You are nothing without me. What will you achieve by taking her in your team? Twinkle will win both the matches. I am telling you. She just lost in Under-14 quarter-final. Twinkle couldn't even qualify. I am telling you. I won't play with her. Okay. We will take someone else on our team. You have gone mad. In fact, you have gone mad, Arvind. I will make your life miserable. I am telling you. Hello. Listen. I can't play. What! - I am in great pain. In fact, I can't even move. I am sorry. I had tried my best. But I don't think I will be able to play with you in the tournament. But, Twinkle, don't give up so easily. Okay. Why are you getting so disappointed? Listen. We will play in Wimbledon together sooner or later. - What! Okay, bye. - Okay. "Oh, baby!" - Bye. I don't want her on our team starting from tomorrow. So, we don't want you on our team. Arjun, let's go. Come! We can't play. And we don't even get good marks in school. You have brought her even here! She is a part of our gang. I need to talk to you. Ask her to leave for two minutes. I will play, but I have a condition. I will be the captain. Arvind, Anushka and you should play against each other. Whoever wins will become the captain. I don't play against girls. - Why? Are you scared? Hey, I am not scared of even Roger Federer. Very nice! Come on.. Yes! Nice one, Anushka! Come on! Very good.. - Hey.. What are you doing? Hey, Captain.. - Arvind.. Arvind! Congratulations! - Thanks. - Very well played! Congratulations! Well played! What's wrong with Arvind? It's okay. He will be back. Where will he go? - How will he leave his friends? Mr. Kumar's son is very bad. - What happened? Take it. - He bunks his coaching. How will he become a cricketer? You need determination. He should say it if he doesn't want to become a cricketer. His dad will be heartbroken. But he shouldn't deceive his dad. Easy. How is your practice going? Very good. - Okay. Did those boys trouble you again? No, Dad. They are nice. I know how they are. They are spoilt, rich brats. - That's not the case, Dad. Dad? - Yes. No, it's nothing. What happened? - It's nothing. I am leaving. Or else, I'll be late for school. Wait for a couple of minutes, I will come with you. No, she will manage. She goes to school on her own. Yes, Dad. Why are you getting worried? I will go. - Why are you in such a hurry? I said that I would accompany you! Come on. Okay, bye! - Bye.. What do I tell him? - Don't say anything today. He is in a bad mood. Bye. Let's meet at the courts in the evening. All right. Okay. Bye. Anushka will be here soon. I don't care when she comes. I'll guarantee you something. This tournament is ours. Do you know why? My mom told me that the cat hasn't cried for four days. What shall I say? - Milk did not curdle for ten days. Do you know what? - What? - It's the most amazing thing! A sacred fig plant has germinated on our roof which is a cemented one! Wonderful! - That too, today, on Monday. Hey, these are auspicious indications. We have consulted a priest too. There will be no obstruction in our way anymore. We will succeed even if we make a mistake. Just wait and watch. - It's Anushka! Give the good news to Anushka too. Which one? - The one about the sacred fig tree. Have you gone mad? Are you going to tell the captain about all this? I am sorry, guys. I am late. It's okay. The captains are usually late. "Let the sparks fly with your might!" "Make your stand!" "Who can stop them?" "They are the jack of all trades." "Winning is their habit." "They are undeterred." "Now, no one can stop them.." "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny!" "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny!" Anushka, you know.. I am very happy that you are going to be playing for us. - Thank you, sir. But don't tell my father. No, I won't. Even I am scared of him. Sir, he is a nice person. Yes, a nice person, who is a bit dangerous. "Come forth. Forget your pain." "Move towards success!" "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny!" Sir, I will make your dream come true. "The fire in your eyes.." "The storm in your gaze.." "They will never be tired." "They are the companions of the flood of courage." "Fan your passion and fuel your determination." "Keep improving yourself every single moment!" I know it takes time to get coordinated against the champion but I will do it. I promise. We don't have a lot of time. Just a minute. - Okay. No one can stop us from winning the Grand Slam! Are you okay? - My dad is back. Haven't you informed him yet? - Are you crazy? He will kill me! - So what? You can join our team as a ghost. Perfect! Ghosts have supernatural powers. We are sure to win the trophy! No! Not a ghost! A female ghost! Shut up. Trust me. He will forget his trauma when he sees the trophy. He will be proud of you. No, his memory is very sharp. He never forgets anything. Especially, the things that make him mad. He loves you. He loves me. But he loves tennis more. Tennis, mom, me.. That's the order. Bye, dear. - Bye, Dad. Hello? I am on duty right now. I will come home at night. This girl! Mister, I'm Anushka Singh's father. - Anushka? - Yes. She left a long time ago. - Did she leave? Where to? She is her class teacher. Talk to her. Excuse me, ma'am. Hello. I am Anushka Singh's father. Yes, I know. I also wanted to speak to you. Actually, she forgot her book in the car. - Her book? She hasn't come to school for many days. She hasn't attended classes for a week. What? But I drop her off to school every day. She has been on leave for a week. She is preparing for a tournament. You can see for yourself. Thank you. Dad! Dad! I am coming! What happened? Why are you so angry? Don't you know? - What? Don't you know that she is playing for the club? Have you two been keeping it from me? It's good that you found out. We were worried about telling you. You guys are making me tense! How could you let her play for the club tournament? That Kanda.. Are you going to do what Kanda says? Don't you know our history? Don't you know he ruined my career? She is a kid. She doesn't know better. But I didn't expect this from you. Listen to me.. - I don't want to listen to you! If you are with my enemy, you are my enemy too! You are your own enemy! We are not! We are trying to tolerate you! It is I who tolerates you! You and the world! Then kill us. Why are you putting up with us? Don't stare at me. I am tired of putting up with your anger and ambitions! You are imposing your ambitions on Anushka now! Have you ever asked her what she wants to play? What her dreams are? No. You will never think of that. You can't think about anyone, but yourself and tennis! Dad. Come on, Anushka. Let's have food. Mom, I want to talk to dad. What's the problem if I play in the Inter-Club Tournament? What will you accomplish by winning this tournament? An Inter-Club Tournament Trophy? At most, the player of the tournament? But if you lose, the stakes are very high! People will wield your defeat as a weapon against you in selections. I am trying to save you from these problems but you are doing what you should not! Selectors will be present there. No matter what you do.. Even if you win all your matches in straight sets, you'll be called a member of a losing team. You have already lost Under-14. If you lose even once, no one will care about you. Listen to this, Anushka. Our bond won't end. But if you lose the tournament our bond of tennis will end forever. All right, Dad. If I lose the tournament, I will stop playing tennis. Reema's amazing backhand winner! And now, Reema breaks! What is happening here? What a roller coaster of a match! No one is able to protect their service game. Reema takes a 6-5 lead in the second set. In the changeover, she needs to focus on one thing and that is to win the service game. That's what will decide who wins the trophy. The match has come to an end but you haven't finished your sugar cane yet! Your calculation turned out to be wrong. How are you going to go to NASA now? The match hasn't ended yet. Just watch the match. Your captain has lost another game. Winning is your destiny, Anushka! It's your destiny. She will have to have positive thoughts when she comes out. Because it's difficult, but not impossible. Amazing down the middle winner! Anushka attempted another chip shot and it looks like.. - Dear.. ...her leg is injured. I think she is injured. I think she's holding her foot. It might be an old injury. She's done the right thing by asking the chair umpire for a medical timeout. It looks like she is badly injured. I had told you. She emulates her father. She is faking it. She was about to lose, so she faked the injury. She will leave the court soon. The match has paused at such a fantastic point. It's a great tournament so far. 'Dear Jaya.' 'Since you two have decided' 'to go ahead with the tournament' 'I think Anushka doesn't need me anymore.' Mom. What happened? Are you all right? 'I am going to Mumbai for some work.' 'I might have to go to Mumbai High Field too.' He left for Mumbai High Field without informing us. 'I hope that I won't find defeated faces on my return.' He said he has some work there. I know he doesn't. For once.. Who does that? Once he comes back, I.. Don't worry. Play the tournament. Play it and win it. For your father. Wow.. In Delhi NCR Inter-Club Junior Tournament Faridabad Gymkhana has won all the matches and advanced to the finals. The defending champions, and the other finalist Delhi Watford Club hasn't allowed any competitor anywhere near it. The final match will be played between the teams tomorrow in Delhi's historic DLTA Stadium. 'According to a fresh report, there's a thunderstorm' 'at Mumbai High Field.' 'It's said that people over there are in danger.' 'Mumbai High Field is an oil field' 'around 175 kilometres away from Mumbai.' 'According to our reporters..' - Call him up. 'The wind is blowing at a speed of 160 kilometres per hour' 'and it is causing high waves.' The phone call isn't connecting. Try again. What happened? - It's not connecting. Let it be. I will talk to Mr. Sekhri. Hello? - Greetings, it's me, Jaya. Okay, greetings. - Actually.. Dilip's mobile phone is switched off. I heard that the site under a storm. Yes, it's under a storm. That's confirmed. But we are not able to contact Dilip either. Don't worry, though. We are trying our best. We will inform you as soon as we contact Dilip. Thank you, sir. Please be quick. - Of course.. Thank you.. He will call up in a while. Try calling him up again. 'Due to the weather, no contact has been established' 'with the employees of ONGC yet.' 'Right now, the company's representative' 'is going to be connected with us over a phone call' 'from Mumbai, Mr. Jaiswal.' - It's not getting connected. 'What update do you have for the viewers, sir?' 'Especially, do you have news for the family members of those' 'who are stuck there?' 'Mr. Jaiswal, are the employees over there safe?' 'Right now..' - Everything will be all right. He will be all right. Everything will be all right. I will go to Mumbai in the morning. I will go there and check. Will you book a ticket for me? I will come with you. - You have to be here. No, I will come with you. You have to be here and play. You have to win, all right? For your father's sake. Go, book a ticket for me. Come on.. 'We will keep you informed.' - Come on! Mom! Mom! Look at this. Dad! Dad, we were so worried! Are you all right? - Yes, I am all right. Dad, I didn't want to play the tournament. I am playing the tournament only for your sake. I will win for your sake. I miss you a lot, Dad. Please come tomorrow. I have never played any tournament without you. Please come. It's the finals tomorrow. Anushka! Don't worry. It will be all right. Get me an ice pack.. - I knew you would come. I had to see you win. I am just stretching it a bit. Okay? Tell me. Is it better? Better? - It hurts. Come, let's sit there. Come.. Take this. Come with me.. Slowly. Get me an ice pack.. Listen to me, Anushka. Stop playing chip shots. It ruined my entire career. Do you get it? Yes! Anushka.. Anushka is ready to play again. There is a new passion on her face. Anushka.. There you go! She is back! I told you so! Don't you ever leave like that again. After going away, I realised that I was a fool. You guys supported every decision I made. It's my turn now. What a moment for Reema! She won the first set by 6-3. The second set with 6-5 and she's leading with 40 love now. Three set points, three match points and three championship points. What is she going through now? She needs one point and she will have the trophy. On the other hand, what is Anushka going through? Anushka, whenever you get left behind in a match you will have two enemies. One, your opponent. What a fabulous down the line winner! Very good, Anushka! And the other, much stronger than the previous one.. It is your own mind. It will defeat you before the opponent does. It was a tough shot, but she played it so well! How do I overcome them? With the amazing down the line winner Anushka has brought the game to deuce, which is a tie. Keep this in mind. You are the champion. Come on! - Amazing overhand winner and advantage to Anushka. She needs one point to win the game. Tell yourself.. Not once, but repeatedly until that's all you hear. You are the only champion. The only one. Anushka played an amazing drop shot! What an incredible fightback by Anushka Singh! She protected three match points and took the second set to a tie break. The set has reached a tie of six each. And now, the tie break will be played. - She'll come back. Now, we have to see who gets the seventh point and with a difference of two points. Darn.. Yes! "Let the sparks fly with your might!" "Make your stand!" "Who can stop them? They are.." Anushka is on a roll! "Winning is their habit." "They are undeterred." "Now, no one can stop them.." "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny!" "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny!" Wow! Yes.. - Yes.. The match is now one set all. Reema won the first set, 6-3. Anushka won the second set, 7-6. And now, this match.. I said the match would be an amazing one! It will progress to the deciding set now. "This dream is not only yours." "It belongs to those who are dear to you too." "This isn't a burden on your shoulders." "This is your aim." - Come on! "Come forth. Forget your pain." "Move towards success!" "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny!" "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny!" Out! No, sir. Sir, it was in. Unbelievable! Anushka Singh is calling the ball in. Overruled. I have never witnessed something like this for years! What a rare display of sportsman spirit by Anushka Singh. "Keep improving yourself every single moment!" "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny!" "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." And for the first time, Anushka is in a position to win where she can win the game, set and the tournament! It won't be easy because she will have to break Reema's service first. Reema won't be going easy either! She does not give up easily. Reema leads with 30-love now. It was an easy top volley. Anushka has scored the first.. Just one more point! Anushka advanced with a chip shot the ball landed near Reema's feet and she couldn't return it! Chip and charge again.. Reema returned it but it was an easy smash for Anushka at the net. The score is 30-40. Anushka is just one point away from victory. - Come on, Reema! It's our last chance! Game point, set point and match point. Anushka needs just one point to win this tournament. Anushka, focus! You are destined to win. You are born to win. Oh, my goodness! Anushka is charging again. And I think she wants to play a chip shot at this critical moment. That too, on Reema's first serve. Wonderful control! The ball is good! And Anushka has won the third set and the match. Come on, Anushka! - Yes! What an incredible victory for Anushka! She was on the verge of losing the match. Who could have thought that she would save three match points and change the course of the match completely. Incredible! Unbelievable! I salute her on behalf of everyone. Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the trophy presentation ceremony of this very prestigious Delhi NCR Inter-Club Junior Tennis Tournament. To lift this year's trophy we would like the captain of Faridabad Gymkhana Anushka Singh, to come on the dais. "Let the sparks fly with your might!" "Make your stand!" Anushka.. - "Who can stop them?" "They are the jack.." Congratulations! What a fantastic victory in the final! We are also giving you.. The Player of the Series Trophy. Anushka Singh! "No one can stop them." Congratulations! - "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly!" She has got two trophies. Don't get angry. "March ahead.. - Wholeheartedly.." "March towards your destiny." "This dream is not only yours." "It belongs to those who are dear to you too." "This isn't a burden.." This is not the victory of the club. This is Anushka's victory. This is the victory of her courage and her strength. She is the one who has formed this team. And this is the victory of her father, Mr. Dilip Singh. On the behalf of Faridabad Gymkhana Club I would like to invite him to take up the post of the secretary of this club. Please give Anushka Singh and her fighter team a big round of applause.
