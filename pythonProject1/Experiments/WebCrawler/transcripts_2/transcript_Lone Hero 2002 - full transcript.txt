foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [SPURS CLINKING] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] Ugh! [GUNSHOTS] Get him! [GUNSHOTS] Ugh! [GUNSHOTS] TIM: O-- OK. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. If you'd have bothered to count my shots, you'd a knowed I was out. But I guess you skunks all turn out to be cowards when the chips are down. [GUNSHOTS] Ugh. You're not dead. Not yet. Oh, my back is killing me. You're doing the fall next time. Any of you all know how to get ketchup stains out. Yeah. Stop smearing the shit on yourself in the first place. Well, kids seem to like it. SHARON: It was founded in 1881 ahead of the gold rush [INAUDIBLE] population of nearly 1,000. 700 more than live here today. [BELL RINGING] [GUNSHOT] [MUSIC - HEADSTONES, "STREETS OF LAREDO"] [BANGING] [RADIO CHATTER] [BANGING] [GUNSHOT] [SMASH] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [SMASH] [GUNSHOT] [SMASH] [GUNSHOT] [SMASH] Hey, I got some [INAUDIBLE] in my car. You guys wanna kill some time. Oh, yeah, man. Beats working. Maybe next time. What? Oh. Right. Good thinking, John. Keep the nose clean. Marshall asshole might promote you to his deputy. Hey, good show today, John. Oh, yeah? Which one did you like? You like the, uh-- the 10:00, the 11:00, 1:30, 2:30, 3:30, 4:30, or the 5:15? Which one of 'em? You know you're showing me a lot of enthusiasm, John. Yeah? Get those other jokers to [INAUDIBLE]. You know, you need to visualize more. Visualize? The funny thing about our craft is that, uh, you know, we have to believe in the story in order to make other people believe it. OK. You're an outlaw. Sure, you're a tough character, but you're also a coward when the chips are down. Yeah, I believe I might have heard that line somewhere. Yeah, and I'm, well, Marshall Bill Harris. Sure. You know, you've heard my reputation everywhere. When I call you out, you're afraid. No, you're terrified. [INAUDIBLE] you don't want to fight me 'cause you know you're gonna lose. -Yeah. So-- so why don't-- why don't I just give then? Yeah. You know, when you come out that door, I need to see more terror. I need to feel the terror. [GUNSHOTS] [KNOCKING] Take her once around the block. I'm off duty. [INAUDIBLE] the price. Oh. Aren't you gonna give me the tour? Why, over there we have a beautiful view of nothing. Coming up around the bend we have some more nothing. Wow. In 1889, nothing happened there. Eventually, though, we'll make our way to a great, big old dead end. It's true. Well, you know, train runs in a circle, so we're-- we're likely to end up right back where we started. Correct. We should talk, hon. The good news is that I got accepted into UCLA for the Fall. I got the letter today. Congratulations. Course, I didn't even you you'd applied. Well, I didn't want anyone to find out if I didn't get in, you know? Well, it looks like we can't come back to Idaho anymore. [GUNSHOT] There a trick to shoot like that. Well, 50 years of practice, if you want to call that a trick. Let me see your gun. I got some 45 shells in the silverware drawer. You wanna grab 'em? Yeah, sure. Undignified end to a real fine shooting piece. Practically a glorified cap gun. [GUNSHOT] See if there's something back there you think you can hit. All right. Try and hit that flamingo from here. [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah. No. Something a little further back. How about that no trespassing sign? All right. Try and hit that. [GUNSHOT] Don't think about it so much. Just, uh, shoot the way you shoot when you're playing cowboy. Yeah? GUS: Yeah. All right. [GUNSHOT] OK. OK. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] GUS: Aw. I had sentimental attachment to that bird. We go back to when I had a lawn. Well, we had to figure she was gonna break up with you eventually, right? -Yeah. Yeah, Tim, I always-- always figured you'd sweep her off her feet. [LAUGHTER] It could've happened, all right? -No, it couldn't have. -Yes. No. I should've seen this coming a mile away. Well, you're always blaming yourself. Fucking blame her, for fuck's sake. I mean, what? JOHN: What the hell is this? Oh, that's a portable phone. I one it in a poker game in Lawrence Creek last week. Piece of shit doesn't work, though. Here. Hey. What? Those things don't just work, you dumb ass. What? You got to go somewhere where they got service for those things, man. That means you gotta drive like 200 miles to the nearest town to have service. [INAUDIBLE] 190 miles farther than you ever been, man. Well, whatever, man. Maybe Sharon'll buy it off me. They gotta have service in Los Angeles, right? PABLO: All right, it's your round, you cheap bastard. That's bull shit. It's John's round. How do you figure that, man? It's fucking John's round. Smokey, who's round is it? Smokey, who's round is it? TIM: I just bought. Hey, Smoke. --[INAUDIBLE] about your girl, John. I guess it's all over town. I just heard you tell Pablo and Tim. Two more. You know, this is some sorry ass small town. I mean, I've been in a lot sorry ass small towns, but this is one of the smallest. Not to mention the sorry [INAUDIBLE], wouldn't you say there, Dog? Damn small, Bart. You probably don't get robbed a whole lot, huh? I mean, six fucking customers a night. There's probably not enough not enough in that register to make you worth robbing. Hm. That-- that might be worth taking. Anything in a frame usually is, Dog. And I do like guns. Oh, yeah. Anybody wanna make the news? Now see, you're more likely to get your name mentioned if you get killed than if you don't. Personally I consider being a famous fool a disincentive to action. [SMASH] [INAUDIBLE] Ugh! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Now that y'all are down, you might as well stay there. [GUNSHOT] Fuck! [LAUGHTER] Just like I thought. Not even worth the taking. Hey, Opie. You gonna call the cops on us. I'm gonna call a doctor first. Looks like you hurt Smokey pretty badly. Yeah, well, old Smokey remembered his moves better than they were. You see my jacket. Iron Bandits. BART: Mm-hm. You know what that means? I can guess. If one of us gets arrested, you can count on two dozen motherfuckers with jackets just like these coming into town, finding the little faggot that got us arrested, and fucking him up but good. Chances are that little fagot's friends and family are gonna get fucked up, too. Something to think about while you're calling an ambulance for old Smokey there. JOHN: Hang on, Smoke. SHERIFF CAL: Any idea how much they got away with. Well, you'd have to ask Smokey to be sure. It didn't look like much. They did get his 1895 commemorative, though. -Oh, boy. -Yeah. You're pretty sure they were bikers. Well, they-- they had biker jackets, and I-- I heard 'em leave on motorcycles, so I'm gonna say yeah. SHERIFF CAL: Thank you, Hank. Would you fellas recognize these guys if you ever saw 'em again? Sure. Well, I-- I, uh-- I pretty much only saw 'em from behind, Cal. Yeah, I mean it kind of happened fast. I mean, I didn't a-- I, uh, don't-- don't see so good. SHERIFF CAL: Right. But you saw him? Yeah, Cal, I think so. Hey, Cal, is there any word on Smokey? Yeah. They're running him up to the hospital in Eudora. He's not gonna die or anything if that's what you mean. Well, thanks for all your help fellas. Get home safe. See you later. OK. Thanks, Hank. [MUSIC - HEADSTONES, "HERO'S HERO"] Hey, Maura? MAURA: Just a minute, John. When you get a minute, would you call Cal Struther and tell him the two robbers from Smokey's are up here, please? Thank you. Put your hands in the air. [INAUDIBLE]. Come again. You're under arrest. [LAUGHTER] [INAUDIBLE] I'll be just fine shooting you. Yeah, you think you can get both of us before one of us gets you. I know I can get you before one of you gets me. If that thing even works. JOHN: You stole one pretty much like it last night. Why don't you tell me? What do you say, Bart? Man's got the drop on us there, Dog. [CHATTER] Go into the jail and get the handcuffs out of the display case. Now, honey. You're gonna put your hands on your head. Then you're gonna lie down on the ground slowly. You take your hand's off your head, and I won't shoot you. You can still save yourself, Opie, because I will come back and find you. I don't know what's holding you up. [CHATTER] Lay down on your belly. Where'd you get the new set of balls, hoss? -It came with the gun, Bart. -Must have. You're a whole new man this morning. Put your hands behind your backs. Go on. Same rules apply, Dog. You move, I'm gonna shoot Bart. It's cool, Dog. There'll be plenty of time later. [CHATTER] The longer this goes on, the worse I'm gonna make it. I'll make it short. [SIRENS] Cal, Hank. These the boys that robbed Smokey's? JOHN: Yeah. Here's Smokey's 45. This one here is Bart's. The, uh, shotgun is the big fellas. I placed 'em under arrest-- a citizen's arrest or something. Is that OK, Cal? Oh, sure, but, uh, how did you, uh-- I just pointed this thing at 'em, and the rest just sort of came natural like. John, you telling me you stopped 'em with a gun loaded with blanks. Son of a bitch. Nice play, John, but pretty soon you gonna wish you'd shot me. -Come on, Hank. Get the big one. [APPLAUSE] -[INAUDIBLE]. SHERIFF CAL: Couple of days, huh? Right. No. That's terrific. Great. Thank you very much. Judge'll be through here on Wednesday, so don't leave town. No, I never do. So what's gonna happen? Robbery and assault are state offenses. I imagine they'll be taking 'em up to Eudora if they want lawyers or anything. You're still planning on pressing charges, right? Seems like we're pretty far along not to, doesn't it? Pretty crazy thing you did there, John. I don't think I want to play poker with you. Not if I have a gun. Have to admit, I wasn't even sure you'd cooperate, much less go out there and arrest them on your own. If I'd had a chance to think about it, I might not have. Fact of the matter was they were right there, and I just pretty much did what I did without even thinking about it. HANK: Excuse me, Sheriff. SHERIFF CAL: Yeah? The talky one says he's entitled to a phone call in private. Is that right? Sounds about right. Keep an eye on him, though. Well, that ain't exactly private, though, is it? Well, unless you'd learn how to read lips, Hank, you can watch him without listening. I guess I better get back to work before they fire me. Mind if I take a-- -Nah, go ahead. Yeah, that's great. Now listen, [INAUDIBLE] gives you any trouble, you just let me know. -Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You ever given any thought to becoming a deputy? Well, isn't that what Hank does? I could always use a nervy guy. What, play cowboy [INAUDIBLE], Cal. I don't plan on getting nervy again any time soon. Thanks, though. Leave word for [INAUDIBLE] and get your ass out here, all right? Hey, John. Would you mind? You made me look pretty stupid there, John. I bet you feel pretty good about yourself, huh? How do you feel about yourself, Bart? What I said last night-- about the little faggot-- you really need to start thinking about that. Decide where you want to be when things start happening, because what's happened so far is fun and games compared to what happens next. Well, Bart, with an attitude like that I'll just have to root for a long jail sentence. Take care. Pull a gun full of blanks. Just dumb luck you didn't get yourself shot. Pretty much. -So what are you gonna do now? -What do you mean? I don't know. DILLMAN: John! John, there you are. Uh, Mr. Dillman. I'm sorry I'm late, but I-- -No. Listen. Listen. I got a friend who was talking to a reporter over in Eudora. Says it's a natural hero. Wild west hero turns actual hero. I-- I play a bad guy, sir. No. No. I know. No, I mean, listen. I put it to Bill as something temporary, but if things work out the way I think they're gonna, huh? Sir, I'm not really interested in Bill's job. John. John, listen. The Red Mountain has the grave of Wyatt Earp's cousin. Old Jasper's gold strike has the haunted mine rid, for God's sake. We are getting killed in the battle for ghost town supremacy. Now, a bona fide hero could change all of that. What do you think about a Marshal John Gray parade. Well, sir, I think that sounds kind of embarrassing. All right, listen up in there. This is Marshal Bill Harris. You've got till the count of three to come out of there with your hands in the air. Then I'm coming in after ya. One, two, two, three! [GUNSHOTS] [CRASH] TIM: Let's get outta here! Go! -Run! -The show's started. Here they go. [GUNSHOT] Ugh! [GUNSHOT] Ugh! I give up, Marshal! You're too good. Marshal, you hear me? I surrender. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [DRY CLICKS] Man of the hour. Yeah. Wanna explain to me why everyone seems more pissed off than anything? You broke the deal. JOHN: What deal is that? The one where everybody acts like sheep, but nobody says nothing about it. They don't want to be reminded they're fundamentally cowards. 100 years ago those guys rode through this town, everybody would turn out in the street armed with shotguns. Today, Smokey gets roughed up and robbed, nobody gets upset. And they'll turn on you, too, John. Just give an excuse, or half a chance, for that matter. ATTENDANT: That'll be, uh, $22. How do I find the police station? Police station? I need to report a crime. [CAWING] It's up over the bridge a couple miles. Can't miss it. -OK. Hi, baby. You've been avoiding me. And that surprises you. I like the way you took charge-- the way you handled those two guys. I've been thinking about his all day, baby. You are a complicated woman, Sharon. Hey. DOG: Never thought you ugly motherfuckers would look so good. It's, uh-- it's past visiting hours. Is that right? It's his job. He'd know. Huh. What do you think, Bart? I think you need to get me the fuck out of here. [GUNSHOT] -Ugh! -Hank? What the hell's going on here? [GUNSHOTS] Well, pretty much does it for the local law enforcement community. -Nice place. -Sure it is. Kind of a Mayberry thing going on around here. How'd you get pinched by these guys? That's something we gotta settle before we split. Somebody find me a phone book and a map. Hey! [CHUCKLING] Am I somehow different than I was this morning? Yes. Yes, you are. Well, I don't think so. So do you want to explain to me why everyone else does? Because a lot of people wouldn't have done what you did today. Most people would not have done what you did today. You're a special man. What if I don't want to be special? Why are you acting like you're ashamed of what you did? I just don't wanna be that guy. 60 years old, and he's still telling that one story about the one thing that happened to him in his life. Maybe you should go out and live a few more. Come on. I'll give you a ride home. Yeah? Yeah. Now, I'm not-- I'm not putting him down or anything, but I've spent a lot of years building this character, you know? And people relate to that. They relate to Marshal Bill Harris. You know, the way I've done it. Can't just bring any fella in off the street and expect him to connect to people that way. I mean, I'm working off a technique, you know? And he's just-- he's just working off of instinct. You know, he's reacting. It's not really acting, is it? Must be more of that gang. Gee, you think? This is a pretty big car. I bet it's big enough to put both of our stuff in it and drive straight to LA. [SCOFFS] Yeah, and then what? I don't know. You could get a job or something. What do you figure I'm qualified to do? You could be an actor. OK, that's-- that's-- that's just ridiculous. Honey, I'm reasonably paid. I've got a satellite dish. Things are pretty good. You sure? [GUNSHOTS] [PHONE RINGING] No answer. Well, uh, that probably means he's not at home, right? That's a good thing, right? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good thing, because if he's not at home, then they can't find him. -Yeah. Maybe I should call Cal, huh? -Good idea. Right. That is a good idea. -Yeah. -That's a very good. You guys got a quarter? Yeah, sure. Here you go. I don't have anything. [HONKING] What the hell's the ruckus? I'm in trouble, Gus. GUS: Yeah? Yeah, some of those bikers. I think I shook some of them cutting across [INAUDIBLE] field, but-- Well, you shook off but one, my guess. Listen, do you have a phone? No. [GUNSHOT] Son of a bitch. [INAUDIBLE] Come on, Gus. Like hell. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] There's a shotgun under the bed. Any reason? [GUNSHOTS] GUS: The possibility of an occasion such as this. [GUNSHOTS] Hand grenades in the [INAUDIBLE]. I'll stick to the shotgun, thanks. [GUNSHOTS] BART: I see you. Ha ha! [GUNSHOT] Hope you're not gonna leave all the fun to me. This is your fight, you know. JOHN: I know. Gus, I want you to know I appreciate it. In fact, you're the first guy I thought of. BART: We ain't gonna hurt ya. [GUNSHOTS] There you are, you little bastard. [INAUDIBLE] Come on. [INAUDIBLE]. [GUNSHOT] Woo hoo hoo! [GUNSHOTS] [INAUDIBLE] I found [INAUDIBLE]. [GUNSHOTS] Come on, ya little pig. Gus, you got any more shells? GUS: Maybe. They're around here somewhere. BART: [INAUDIBLE]. [GUNSHOTS] All right, never mind. Make sure you have bullets in yours. [GUNSHOTS] Don't hit me! [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] Then you felt the need to cheat? I was just getting curious to see who'd win this. Your call. What do you want to do with him? Considering what they done to my home, I'd be all right killing him. John's not up for that. Are you, John? I guess we should bring him back to Cal. That oughtta be interesting. First we should put him away. Away? You know, I could suffocate in here. No. You fellas ventilated my car just fine. How do you like that? Shells were behind the wreckage after all. Us or them. Personally I believe we made the correct choice. This your first time, Gus. John, there's a reason I live out here with no phone and no mailbox. You need to know the particulars? No. I'll follow you in case he knows some cute way for getting out of a locked trunk. I'll him over, too. [KNOCK] BART: Hey, John. John, can you hear me? You're just getting yourself more and more fucked as you go along. You oughtta think about that. [TIRES SCREECHING] Oof! [BANG] Yeah, I get the point there, John. Makes it pretty clear who we're dealing with. So here you are with a bad guy in your trunk and nobody to give him to. [LAUGHTER] Uh-oh! [LAUGHTER] I don't think he's got the stomach for what's coming. If he doesn't, I do. Oh, I know. You're the first one I'm gonna kill when I get a chance. That's fair. You're the first one I'm gonna kill soon as I get an excuse. Phone's dead. BART: Not only that, but the guy you let get away is gonna come back with the whole club. You boys are just a few short hours away from being overrun. I'm gonna need your truck. You can take my car. Take it where? Find a phone. Call the state police. Hey, you sure you can handle him. I'll do what I have to. No, you already missed that boat, John. Your best bet is let me go. I might just leave town and never come back. Yeah? What do you figure the chances of that happening? Shotguns tucked in back. I left you a little present under the seat. Keep your options open. Thanks, Gus. [BANGING] Get out. -Yeah? What if I told you to go fuck yourself? Why don't you try, and I guess we'll find out. I'm not gonna try anything just yet, John. Kinda interested in where this is going. Well, for now it's going up. Gus! Hey, whoa, whoa, have you seen John? Yeah I saw him about 10 minutes ago. Is he all right? -Any reason he shouldn't be? -No, no. Just no reason. Just-- just looking for him, you know? See ya. Man, that guy scares me, man. TIM: No shit, man. Hey Pabs, I'm gonna walk home, man. I'm too drunk. -You all right? TIM: No, I'm good. Come on, Gus. You see the signs are off. I'm gonna use your phone. Son of a bitch. Phone's dead. -Yeah? -Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Taking a quarter. Shit. That one, too? Guess the lines are out. -You got any idea how long? -I don't know. Pablo used it an hour ago. Guess I gotta go to Lourdes Creek. Hey, hey. What about my quarter? -It's in the phone. Shit. BART: You know, John, I didn't have anything against those cops. They were just doing their job. Yeah, just doing their job and you killed 'em. BART: Because that's my job. I'd like to think they understood that, but is wasn't your place to get involved. Not your job. Yeah, that's what I keep hearing. Sit down against that post. What, are you kidding? You can either cooperate or I'll hit you with the butt of this shotgun till you can't see straight, and that's your choice. I don't think so, John. Oof! Had a feeling it was gonna come to that sooner or later. Shit. [CRACKLING] Hey, John? This mine shaft's better than 100 years old, Bart. Pull too hard on that, no telling what's gonna fall on your head. That's some shot you gave me there, hoss. You know, when people find out what you did, a lot of them are gonna want you dead. -Uh-huh. Your point being? Well, my point being, if I'm forced to shoot you, no one's gonna blame me. Tough talk don't look good on you, John. OK if I tell you something? It would be better if you didn't. You'd of kicked the shit out of me in a fair fight. You're faster than me. Strong enough. But I was always gonna win. See, you fight schoolyard rules. Every time I lay down, you're done, but I fight till I'm dead or the other guy is. So you're gonna keep on knocking me down and walking away, leaving the job unfinished, and I'm gonna keep getting up and coming back until I kill you. Well, that sounds a lot more threatening come from someone who isn't chained to a mineshaft. Shit, John, you know you're gonna have to untie me sooner or later. Then me and you-- we'll go at it again. And if you win, you'll tie me up again, and I'll just wait for my next shot at you, man. And if by some miracle you actually get me to a jail and I don't escape, I'll spend the next 10 years waiting. I'll come straight back after your ass. You know, Bart, you sure do talk a lot for someone who folds every time a gun's pointed his way. I'm not gonna win by being stupid. Hey, hey. Cops never do find this. Don't ask me why not. You got a light? Hm. If you had one yourself, why'd you ask. Just testing you out, John. [KNOCKING] [KNOCKING] -Is John here? -No. Should he be? Well, I went by his house, and he wasn't there. And? And you didn't do anything? I didn't know what to do. Well, I'd like to know what Hank and Cal are doing about all this. -Jesus. SHARON: All right, uh-- [INAUDIBLE] oh God, look out. [SMASH] [SHARON SCREAMING] String him up. You are pretty tough [INAUDIBLE]. Still, I don't think you're as tough as I am mean. I guess we're gonna find out. KING: Guess we are. It's only gonna get worse for you, man. I mean, as it stands, you're negotiating for the right to be killed quickly. Is everybody ready? STICKY: Uh-huh. Did you get anything out of him yet? Just answer the questions, Sticky. Don't waste any effort figuring out which ones to ask. [SCREAMING] Fuck was that? Pryor pulled over a car. You know what's it like with women. So we're in here in the middle of an action, and that idiot's out there trying to get some exercise. Get him the fuck in here. STICKY: Literally half the people who live in this town work in that ghost town. Good. We go in hard. We bust in one at a time till someone gives him up. STICKY: Could take a while. KING: The phone lines are down. The only road in and out of this shit hole was detoured. We got all fucking day if we need it. Oh my god. Gus? PRYOR: What the fuck you want, King? Exactly what you just brought me. Do you have any idea what two dozen hardcore club member will do to a woman, Gus? Let's see her tits. Gus. Gus, that's a fucking banquet. All right. All right what? All right I'll take you to him. They're in the mountains. KING: You're gonna take me up in the mountains? There's not a lot of road signs up there. You wouldn't find them on your own, but you gotta let her go. Yeah, but that would mean I'd have to trust you, Gus, and I sure as shit don't. OK. Let's take old Gus here up the mountain. Go get Lyle. Pryor, you're fucking going for sure. Honcho, you go, too. If it looks like he's bullshitting about anything, kick his ass all the way down here, OK? Where are my manners? Hm? No? Hey, what were you doing with a gun full of blanks anyway? I'm in the wild west show. The wild west show? You mean where you-- you dress up like cowboys and pretend to have gun fights and shit? Uh-huh. [SCOFFS] I guess that's what passes for showbiz in this part of the country. JOHN: It's a job. It sure as shit is. This is probably the most exciting thing that's ever happened to you, huh, John? Shit, I bet the bar getting robbed was the most exciting thing that ever happened to you up until then. What, you carry this kind of excitement with you everywhere you go? And no one ever thanks me. [CHUCKLING] You know, you're gonna have to explain to me about you. You got some skills. You're good with your hands. You think on your feet. Yeah, so? So life must offer a guy like you a little more than minimum wage in the middle of fucking desolation, huh? You sound like my ex-girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend. Well, well, well. The picture gets clearer. One time she told me I was allergic to opportunity. I wouldn't have characterized you like that, John. Lack of imagination maybe. Fear of the unknown. Oh, not like yourself, huh, Bart? Anyone's got fears, John. What I don't have are regrets. You strike me as a guy who's looking at a lot of those down the line. It's been a while, John. I wonder where all those cops are. They're coming. Oh, I don't know. That's a good idea, John. Go find out how really fucked you are. National Guard show up yet, John? Or does it look like a Harley convention down there? (SINGING) As I walked out on the streets of Laredo, as I walked out on Laredo one day, I spied a young cowboy all dressed in white linen, all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay. [CHUCKLING] Hey. -You seen John yet? -No. Pablo either. [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] Get out of our way! [GUNSHOTS] Get on over here. Get on! That's good. [SCREAMING] Come on. Move it. Move it. Hoo hoo! [MANIACAL LAUGHTER] Yeah, that's it! Yee ha! Good morning, citizens of Profit. Slow up, old man. Slow up any more, I'll be crawling. Slow up, or I'll slow you down. America's youth is in shit shape. KING: My friends are supposed to be coming down that mountain with our boss. If that happens, everything's cool. If that doesn't happen, we're going to get up to some of that awful shit you can imagine we're pretty good at. Now, depending on how long it takes us to find this John guy, we may get up some even awfuller shit just out of spite. So does anybody have anything they'd love to share with us right now to avoid a whole lot of heartache later? Fucking King send me up the fucking hill. That was my chick. I fucking found her. I think I'm having a heart attack. Come on. A half beat up old man's making it. No, seriously. My left arm is numb. I want everybody to freeze and put their hands in the air. You gotta be fucking kidding. There's four of us. Yeah, and every one of you is pointed in the wrong direction. Just shoot 'em for Christ's sake. No, no, no, no. Calm down. We can discuss this. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [DISTANT GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] Give up and I won't kill ya. Hey, you give up, and I won't kill you. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] Yeah, keep talking, nothing gets done. Shooting stopped. Yep. -So how do you know you win? -Either way. Gotta stick to a pistol, John. You're pretty sloppy with a scatter gun. Well, I guess he was having a heart attack. All the way up there What is jackpot's gonna work out. How'd you know where I was? Well, you're clever John. You're not a genius. There's about 20 of 'em down there. They got the phone lines cut, the roads shut down. Now, even if somebody wanted to take a run for it and bring back help, it'd take 'em hours. Well, I'll wait then. No, no, no. Can't do that. They got your girlfriend. BIKER: Come on. Shut up. Move it. Move it. Shut up. This way. [INAUDIBLE] Get on. HARRIS: You guys are spending a lot of time and a lot of energy trying to keep us in place, and all you really want to do is get your friend [INAUDIBLE]. You understand? I mean, I-- I understand. I know what you're saying. All I'm saying is that you're going out of your way to harass us for no good reason. You didn't listen too god damn hard, did you? You know, most of us are mad at him anyway for getting involved in this in the first place? -Yeah, right. -Yeah. I mean, if you let us go, we'd all go home, and we'd put our feet up, turn on the TV, and, uh, wait till you fellas got out of town. I mean, you know, isn't that a lot easier than trying to keep an eye on 20 of us. Nobody's ever explained the concept of hostages to you before, have they? -Yes, they have. -You're wasting our time. I know it's [INAUDIBLE]. OK, just a second. Just a second. Listen, the thing is, you've already got his girlfriend. KING: Girlfriend? HARRIS: Yeah, she's the only one he gives a damn about. She's worth the whole damn town to him. What? Come on. Are you listening to me? -Just did. -OK. All right. OK, OK. We'll talk later. That's fine. Thank you. What were you guys talking about? They want their friend. The sooner they get him, the sooner they'll leave us alone. What, are you planning on helping them, Bill? I'm saying what everybody else is thinking. If John hadn't played hero in the first place, we wouldn't have this problem. They just killed Cal and Hank. Yeah, to get their friends out of jail. Who's fault is it they were there in the first place? John has behaved very irresponsibly. TIM: Irresponsibly? What'd you tell 'em, Bill? I'm looking out for the best interest of everyone. You son of a bitch. You son of a bitch! I am taking responsibility for getting us out of this mess. That's what heroism is all about. Well, I guess we're moving on to plan B. You the fella in charge? At the moment. I think I have something you want. Hop aboard. If I was gonna fuck with you, it would've happened already. Hop aboard. I guess you figured out by now your first idea didn't work out too great. Your second idea have anything to do with laying a hand on me, you just keep in mind there's over 400 mines dug into the side of that mountain. And? And I'm the only one knows which one Bart's in. Kill me, and he'll be dead long before you can find him. You want to make a deal. There's a police substation about 60 miles east on route 13. We'll meet across the street just like old friends. Bart'll get out of the truck, you fellas'll ride away. Just like that, huh? Just like that. Soon as you're gone, I'm gonna walk into the police station. I'm gonna make a complete report. That oughtta give you fellas motivation to ride along. Well, you've obviously put a lot of thought into this plan of your, John. Now, if you'd covered all the angles, it'd be a good one. Yeah? What angle am I missing? Well, I was getting to that. I don't know, man. There's just something about the atmosphere of this place. I understand she means something to you. How do you want to do this? Well, you and the old man shot two bandits. Four more went up the mountain, and none came down. I mean, we're not leaving until you're dead. And whoever gets caught in the cross fire is entirely up to you. There's a quarry north of town by the river. Well, if we get lost, I know who I'm gonna ask for directions. Be there in an hour and a half. Even swap. Me and Bart for her. You have any thoughts about following me back up there, just remember what happened to the last fellas who tried it. You're gonna die for her, John. That's fucking romantic. What's even more romantic is the face that I'm gonna take a few of you with me. In case there's still any doubt about me doing what I have to. Now let me see if I got this straight. This bitch dumps you, but you're gonna try to save her and probably get yourself killed. I don't expect you to understand it. Oh shit, John, I understand perfectly. You know how much money we got out of that cash register? $76. What, do you figure that's not enough for principle? Well, that's not enough money to get killed over. That's for damn sure. No, John, you're digging this. Huh? [LAUGHTER] Huh? The guns, the shooting, being a fucking hero. That wild west show has gone to your head, cowboy. It's clouded your judgement. Oh, yeah, but if it was you-- Oh, I'd say fuck the town. Fuck the girl. Fuck everything, man. As a matter of fact, I'd shoot Bart right between his fucking eyes, and I'd get in this pickup truck, and I'd go in the other direction, because that's the only chance you've got for staying alive for another hour. And it's always about staying alive, John. You know, Bart, you keep making a pretty good case for me to shoot you. Is there anything you want to tell me? Well, if I thought you had half an instinct to do it, we'd be talking about something else. I'm just trying to level the playing field, John. You're a talented amateur, but you're fucking with professionals. Well, Bart, by my count, you got about six dead professionals already. Shoot whoever you have to, but make sure you leave a few hostages just in case. This is bullshit. They're out there killing someone, we get stuck back here. Well, King said we could shoot a few. Which one? -I don't know. They all look like victims to me. It's like picking a puppy. The right one picks you. [CHUCKLING] Glad you fellas finally decided to listen. BIKER: Get on your knees. -Now. Now, this is to show you what's going to happen if anyone fucks with us. Have you fellas consulted with [INAUDIBLE]? Consulted? We're not fucking lawyers, pal. Fair warning. Drop your guns. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] MAN: He shot 'em. Have it your way. MAN: Get it open. Unlock this. Unlock the door. Marshal. MAN: I don't know about you. I'm getting out of here. WOMAN: Oh! MAN: Now. Come on, [INAUDIBLE]. Hey, John's gonna need some help here. Who's with me? MAN: Come on, let's go. [CHATTER] I'll-- I'll go get some help. Oh, this town's got a lot of heroes. You two, hey! Ah, fuck me. All right. BART: I can't wait to see what you got figured out for this. Where the fuck did that come from? The dresser. Get out. Anybody gets ambitious, I'll leave a crater right where we stand. I think you got everyone's attention there, John. All right, here's how it's gonna work. Sharon's gonna get in the truck. She's gonna drive away. Soon as she's gone, I'll put the pin back in this hand grenade. Nope. You let Bart walk, then she can drive away. Well, I guess this is where we agree to disagree then. What do you say? I'm inclined to try it his way. Hey, King, this gets hinky, y'all open up on this motherfucker and his ex-girlfriend. You know what I want you to do? No. Exactly what I said. Get in the truck. You hit the gas pedal, and you drive straight back to Profit. Straight back, you got it? Uh-uh. You just keep going. You don't stop for anything. Sharon, you do exactly as I say. Everything's gonna be fine. Don't you believe him, ex-girlfriend. -Trust, me Sharon. -OK. Isn't that just like a woman, John? Leaving you here all alone with all of us. BIKER: Grenade! [BOOM] Drive! Drive, Sharon! [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] SHARON: Oh, God! No! [INAUDIBLE]. Oh my God! Well, that was pretty god damn good, wasn't it? You did great. I don't know why you figured that I would. Well, if you drive into the middle of a biker gang with a hand grenade, any other chance you have to take seems pretty reasonable. Where are we going, babe? Come on! [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] Split up! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] JOHN: Oh, Gus, you are a disturbing man. [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] Ugh! Ah. Oh, for Christ's sake. [MUFFLED GUNSHOTS] Well, well, well. Look what we have here. -No. No. Ah! No! [SCREAMING] No! Yeah. JOHN: You're both pointed in the wrong direction. Drop your weapons, I'll let you live. [GUNSHOTS] They never do seem to appreciate the warning. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] Ugh! [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] He's inside. Yeah, so what are you doing out here? Oh, for Christ's sakes. King, you have a TEC-9, and he's got a fucking revolver. Go nuts, boss. I'm not gonna let some hip motherfucker punk me out. KING: He's on the roof! [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] BART: Hey, John, let's make a deal. Here's how it goes. [GUNSHOTS] KING: Yeah! [GUNSHOTS] Ah! Ugh! Ah! Ugh! Ah! [GUNSHOTS] You are making this so worthwhile! [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] Well, I guess it does always seem to come down to you and me, doesn't it, Bart? Sure does, John. So how do you wanna finish this? Gonna bring me in again? [CHUCKLING] There isn't a prison that can keep me from coming back again and again. Probably not. Good for you, John. And all this time I didn't know if you were listening. The arm? You just refuse to learn, do you, John? Well, the same could be said about you, Bart. [CHATTER] The Profit experience will take us down the path of John Gray, who is the bravest cowboy in the west, and his battles against black Bart and his gang. People still find bullets from time to time. It always seems to come down to just and me, don't it, Bart? It sure does, John. So how are you gonna finish it? Bring me in again. You know there aren't prison walls thick enough to keep me from coming back again, and again, and again. Go ahead. Go for it if you've got the nerve. [GUNSHOT] [APPLAUSE] Thanks everybody. Next show's at 3 o'clock. Yeah! Ha ha! Not bad, huh? -Yeah. Yeah, we're trying to actually figure out a way where we can both shot Harris and still make it seem like a fair fight, you know? What about you? Eh, I think I've had enough guns for a while. I guess it's time for a change. Sharon's been showing me your new ride. Yeah? There seem to be a lot of unowned motorcycles just lying around, so. Looks to me like you're loaded up for a trip. Well, I figured I'd give her a ride out to Los Angeles. Take a look at the ocean. What are you gonna do after that? Bye. Woo! [MUSIC - HEADSTONES, "STREETS OF LAREDO"]
