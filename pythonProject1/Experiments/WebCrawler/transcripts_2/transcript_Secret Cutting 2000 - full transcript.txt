They're the most beautiful animals, loyal. They mate for life, and doing anything for the survival of their pack, their family. So that's what I was thinking for the winter carnival. Um, there'd be a big halo of ice around your throne, trees in the background, wolves at your feet. I was even thinking we can get some artificial snow falling down. REBECCA: No. No snow. Why not? Why not? Because I have to sit there with $100 haircut and a $500 gown, and I-- I don't want Styrofoam flakes falling on me. You're supposed to be the artistic one. If you can't do it-- No. I can do it. Good. My gown is blue. I'll give you a swatch and make sure everything matches. Now there's a cry for help if I ever saw one. LORRAINE RAFEEDIE: Rebecca? I have a good idea for you. - Yeah. What? When you're up there doing your little ice queen number, give us your best Princess Di salute. Bitch, don't ever diss the Princess of Wales. [scoffing] You're such a freak. [music playing] [bell ringing] Did you see her hands? Can you believe that this sketch could trail do with dogs all around me? CLASSMATE 1: Well-- Whatever. If I wanted canines at my feet, I would've made it part of my court. [laughter] [door slamming shut] Oh Dawn? Dawn? [mimicking wolf howl] [laughter] [bell ringing] [music playing] RUSSELL COTTRELL: This is great chicken, honey. It's very tender. JOYCE COTTRELL: It should be for the price I pay. Well, whatever it costs it's great. I'm on the winter carnival committee. JOYCE COTTRELL: You are? They picked me to design the whole thing. That's great, Dawn. I'm thinking about a snow princess thing. JOYCE COTTRELL: When we did ours we did Hans Christian Andersen silver skates. I went with Joe Burroughs. I was supposed to go with Bobby Campbell, but he was too shy to even ask me. Before I forget, I gotta work this weekend. Every weekend? Doesn't your boss know you have a family? RUSSELL COTTRELL: He knows, just not sure he cares. That's why I want you guys to get a good education, so you don't get jerked around. ALEX COTTRELL: You have a good education and you get jerked around. Alex, you didn't excuse yourself. I never do. It's delicious. Thank you. No pie? I have some paperwork. You always have paperwork. RUSSELL COTTRELL: Honey-- Mom, I'll help with the dishes. JOYCE COTTRELL: You know your art teacher? DAWN COTTRELL: Mh-hm. JOYCE COTTRELL: Did she tell you what you have to go? DAWN COTTRELL: Sometimes-- sometimes she lets us do it alone. You know, you've been promising to do my portrait. You and dad together We just got to get you both to sit still for three hours. Well that shouldn't be hard for him if you put a football game on. Mom, I'm seeing this boy. Really? You have a boyfriend? Yes, really. Is that such a surprise? No. So what's the story? What's his name? Craig. He's 19. JOYCE COTTRELL: How long have you been seeing him? Few weeks now. Oh Dawn, I hope you'll be careful. Mom. Oh, don't act so shocked. I know about kids today 12 and 14 years old and they're out there experimenting. That's not what I'm interested in. Oh. Well it's damn sure what he's interested in. A 19-year-old boy is a walking erection. He's sensitive. He's a musician. [laughter] A musician and he's not after sex? [laughter] That's good. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dawn. Sex is important. Take your father and me. I mean we got married for all the right reasons. A home, kids. The sex was hm, but I figured it would get better. And after 20 years when it doesn't and you make love once a month, maybe-- Mom-- Dawn, I'm trying to be open with you. Anything you want to talk about I'll listen. You know how it was with my mother. To her, communicating meant slapping my face. Now, I hope that's not the kind of mother you want. But if you get pregnant, who are you gonna turn to? Your father? No, I don't think so. It'll be me, just like everything else around here. [music playing] CRAIG CROSETTO: Hey. DAWN COTTRELL: Hi. So does anybody know you're here? Did anybody see you coming? No, I don't think so. Good. Just because you know people like to talk, ruin a good thing by yapping about it. Me personally, I like to keep it inside, save it for my music. Like it's just our little secret. Exactly. [music playing] You writing a song? I'm always writing songs. [music playing] Maybe one day I'll write a song about you. [music playing] You're pretty. No. What? It's cold. I want to leave it on. Don't worry about that I'll make you warm. I'm just-- I'm just-- I'm just not ready for this. CRAIG CROSETTO: Hey, no means no. Wait. There are other things we can do. Oh yeah? Like what? [music playing] [knocking on door] [door squeaking open] Dad, can I see you a minute? Um, yeah. Come on in. What's up? I've got this math test on logarithms. I can't figure these things out. Logarithms, huh? You know what? These things look scarier than they really are. Mr. Warner only puts two questions on the test. Miss one and you fail. Really? We can't have that. You got to get that college scholarship. I can't afford to send you. So let's have a look. Dad? Hm? When you're with a boy, what if he doesn't say much? Not much of a talker I guess. Some guys aren't. You don't think it means-- Look, you know what? Logarithms, it's just easier if you sit down and plow right through them. It's OK. I got it. Hey? Ace that test, make me proud. [music playing] I'll help you with that. DAWN COTTRELL: No, It's OK. No, I'll do it. Listen, you can't carry all of that. Come on. You're not embarrassed to be seen with your mother, are you? [music playing] [bell ringing] Boy, ah, this brings back memories. Waiting around for classes to start, standing around gossiping, flirting with boys. Place even smells the same. Oh sorry, Dawn. Mom, I've got to get these to the art room. Oh, I'll take them. It's OK. Uh, uh, you go hang out with your friends. No, it's OK. You don't think I know where the art room is? Well, I've got this special project I'm working on. That's great, sweetheart, but socializing is a part of school too. I know, but-- Dawn, go on. This is the fun part of school. I'll go with you. Come on. It's OK, I'll go. Good girl. Um, excuse me, Rebecca. I have some new ideas for the carnival. Not now, I'm talking to people. Anyways-- CLASSMATE 1: Yeah. So I was like super did not sleep. What are you doing? I said later. Who is that? Your mom? Oh, I get it. You want her to think you're popular. All right, showtime guys. Hi, Mrs. Cottrell. We're such good friends with your daughter. And we just can't wait to see her every morning. She gives us beauty tips and fashion advice. We just can't wait to hear about the boy she's dating. [music playing] You owe us big time. This carnival better be perfect. Yeah, it will. [music playing] [breathing hard] You know, this doesn't surprise me at all. Lorraine. [breathing hard] All the crap you take from people I figured you had to be doing something to level yourself out, but this is extreme. It was just a blister. I was trying to lance it. Yeah, right. I've heard about this kind of thing. Let me see it. Come on, I'm not gonna tell anybody. Come on. [music playing] Doesn't that hurt? Only when I want it to. Ooh, freaky. Who knew you had it in you? Hey, you want to hit it before I put it out? You won't tell anybody? Who am I gonna tell in this hole? Nobody listens to me, and as far as I can tell nobody gives a damn about you. [bell ringing] [grunting in anger] [bell ringing] Come on. TEACHER: You have exactly one hour and 15 minutes to demonstrate your mathematical prowess. Remember, this exam is worth 50% of your final grade. Dawn, what's this? [music playing] [bell ringing] [music playing] You're saying that she cut her own arm on purpose? That's crazy. PRINCIPAL LUCE: We've been getting reports on this from other schools. It's like the new version of anorexia. High strung kids, troubled kids, kids with screwed up parents. We're not making any judgments here, we are just concerned about Dawn. We want to make sure she doesn't harm herself. She told the nurse it was an ice skating accident. Have you seen the cuts? Take her home, look at them. You'll see what I mean. We've had our official sit down. The problem's in your hands now. Have a talk with Dawn. If you want us to help you arrange for a counselor, we will, but if this happens again on school grounds we'll have to take action. OK. Come on, Russell. Thank you. When she applies for college, will this be on her record? [door closing] JOYCE COTTRELL: That principal's blaming this on us. RUSSELL COTTRELL: Joyce, she didn't say that. JOYCE COTTRELL: Not in so many words, but you know that's what she's thinking. Dawn's cutting her own arm. God knows what she thinks we're doing to her. She said she'd keep it confidential and she's not even gonna tell any of the other teachers. She also said there were other girls doing it. So it's not like she's the only one. OK, let's see this thing. Mom, they just put the bandages on. JOYCE COTTRELL: And you can put them right back. [music playing] Oh. Good lord, Dawn. JOYCE COTTRELL: What the heck is this? I told you, I got tangled up with another skater. She nicked me with her blades. In nice little neat rows like that? Some scabbed over, some fresh. Man, it's like some animal clawed her. Dad. RUSSELL COTTRELL: Yeah, Alex, why don't you go on over to Frankie's, huh? - What? And miss all the fun? Alex, please. I don't understand, Dawn. What is it that would make you do something like that to yourself? I don't know. JOYCE COTTRELL: You don't know? No. You mutilate your own arm and you have no idea why you do it? You're her father, don't you have something to say? This is a terrible thing that you're doing to yourself, Dawn. Now I want you to promise us that you'll stop. Oh, that ought to put a halt to it. You know what? Let's you and me go out together, OK? This one's nice I've always thought you should wear more lavender. Oh, that's pretty. Yeah, it's pretty. I just don't know if it works for me. Well, how about white? DAWN COTTRELL: Oh, it's nice. Oh. But you don't like turtlenecks. Oh. This is pretty. Yeah. I might have to try this one on myself. Here, you try it on. Dawn? Help me understand why you're doing this to yourself. Is it school? Is it that boy you're seeing? Your hormones jumping around? Yeah, maybe. I don't know. Is it me? Something I'm doing? Is it? You're saying it's me? No, mom, I didn't say that. You're blaming this on me? DAWN COTTRELL: No. And what exactly is it that I've done that's so terrible. Nothing. I treat you like my best friend. I take you everywhere. You know what my mother did to me? 10 years old all the cooking and cleaning, taking care of my brother. That was my job while she laid upstairs curtains drawn, covers over her head. Mom, people are looking. Oh, I'm sorry. Am I embarrassing you? Try being called to the principal's office because your daughter is sawing on her own arm. I've had enough craziness in my life from my own mother. I will not have it in my life again. I won't. This is good. Yeah. JOYCE COTTRELL: I'm telling you, this thing she's doing scares the hell out of me. Maybe-- maybe she's just too sensitive. Don't make excuses. Excuses? This is not some teenager telling lies or staying out past curfew. She's slashing her own skin. What if she hits a vein? Maybe we should get her into therapy. No. I know her better than anybody and I could barely get two words out of her. I am not sending her off to some stranger. RUSSELL COTTRELL: What do we even know about that sort of thing? JOYCE COTTRELL: I know our daughter. How long is it gonna take some shrink to get inside of her head? Meanwhile, she keeps slicing. We don't have that kind of time. RUSSELL COTTRELL: So what are you gonna do? JOYCE COTTRELL: What am I gonna do? She's our daughter. RUSSELL COTTRELL: Yeah, but you're the one she's closest to. Didn't used to be that way. It seems every problem we have falls right in my lap. I'm bringing in a paycheck Tom Naydell does the same work and he has enough time for Leslie and their children. RUSSELL COTTRELL: Well Tom Naydell is happy where he is. I'm trying to get ahead. Oh. Which is why you spend every spare second you have in your den playing with glass. - Helps me think. - Yeah. Well you better start thinking about how you're gonna help me deal with this. That's the point of being married, isn't it, so you don't have to do it all alone? [music playing] What? Wh-- what is it with you? You-- you suck my lungs out and then you won't even let me touch you. I'm sorry. [music playing] OK, let's do it. [music playing] Awesome. [music playing] Wait. What is-- what is this? Are you on your period? I scraped my thigh. You scraped your thigh? [music playing] You want to do this or not? Yeah. Yeah, I-- I do. Yeah. [kissing sound] [music playing] Thinking of jumping? Hey. You got this look on your face. What? Are you in trouble or something? Huh? Oh, no. I-- I was just out with this guy last night. A guy. Who? Craig Crosetto. Oh. I remember him. He dropped out of school to do his music and thinks he's gonna be the next Lenny Kravitz. He's pretty good. You oughta hear his stuff. Anyway, you went out with this guy last night and-- and-- You know. What? You skipped rope, lifted weights. No. We-- Ah, say it. Come on, just say it. You did it. Yeah. First time? Uh-huh. So how'd it feel? Hurt a little, kind of bloody. Come on, you're used to that. Thanks. Eh, it's part of my charm. That's why you got this big crowd of friends all around you. Ouch. So now that you're a woman, you think it'll make you stop? Why would that make me stop? Hey, I got to go see my shrink. Walk with me. You see a shrink? Uh-huh ever since my old man put that rope chick in the backyard, like-- most of these psycho doctors they're just loony tunes, like working with all these schizos has rubbed off on them. But Parella isn't like that. I think you'd like her. DAWN COTTRELL: Me see a therapist? You don't think you're a candidate? My mom would have a heart attack. Who says she has to know? Dr. Parella is very discreet. Aren't you, doc? DR. PARELLA: Hi, Lorraine. Hi. This is, uh, Dawn, the girl I told you about. Hi, Dawn. You told her? What? I get bored talking about my own problems. It's good to meet you, Dawn. You coming upstairs? Actually since she's here I thought maybe she could have my session. ALL: No. No. No. That's not the way it works. If Dawn wants to speak to me, she's gonna have to give me a call on her own. You know that. Dawn? Dawn? You know Lorraine is very concerned about you. She thinks what you're doing is a slow version of killing yourself. She doesn't understand about cutting and how good it feels to be in charge of your own pain because the best thing would be to get rid of the pain altogether. I'll tell you what, I'll give you my card. If you ever feel like talking, you just give me a call, OK? See you upstairs. K. Hey? You're not gonna slice itself up over this, are you? Seeing her I thought it might help you stop. Who says I want to stop? Well, you can't just keep carving yourself up. All that dope you smoke, how would you feel if someone tried to take it away from you? OK, I got you. Understand. I gotta go up. If you want, maybe we can hang out again. I'll try not to be such a spaz next time, OK? K. [music playing] For what it's worth, she's never tried to take my dope from me. [music playing] I've got to go back to school tonight, um, work on the carnival sets. That's taking a long time, huh? They're pretty complicated. Well, it's good to see you getting involved, making new friends. Yeah. [utensils clanking on plates] Mom, where are all the knives? I put them away. Come on back to the table. You didn't think I'd notice that little cut on your side last night. You don't seem able to control yourself, so until you do-- Joyce, I don't think she's gonna cut herself at the dinner table. You want to handle this? So how am I supposed to eat? I'll cut it for you. [knife scraping against plate] You're not finished. Feeding the dog. Alex, we don't have a dog. Yeah, we do. JOYCE COTTRELL: Alex, that is enough. He's young. He doesn't understand this. Alex, honey? [door slamming shut] [music playing] [vacuum running] Goodnight, Andrea. See you tomorrow. ANDREA: Goodnight, Dr. Parella. [vacuum running] WOMAN: [non-english] It's OK. It's OK. OK. OK. You all right? OK. [music playing] [kissing sound] Come on. Let's get your jacket off, huh? No. All right. Listen, if I could see what I was doing I can make you feel a lot better. I like it this way. What are talking-- whoa. What is-- what is that? What the hell is that? Nothing. What? Did you scrape yourself again? It's the same as before. No. No. No, it's not. Don't. Is somebody doing this to, or what? It's none of your damn business, all right? Are you giving me attitude? You don't have to look. You don't have to comment. All right, come on. What are you doing? If I'm gonna take this from a girl it's gonna be one that's a whole lot prettier, whole lot less psycho than you are. Down button means down. Craig? [music playing] Dawn, he's not gonna tell anybody. It scares me the most. What if he talks to his friends? Seriously, I wouldn't worry. You know how guys are, they-- they love to talk. Your secrets. And all it takes is one person. He's not gonna tell. One person and it's all over school. He's not gonna tell. He's not gonna tell because he doesn't want anybody to know he is screwing you. This whole boyfriend fantasy that you have-- he sneaks you into his place to get his rocks off, and you're all moony about my secret love. He was ashamed to be seen with you. Girls like you, you don't even know when you're being dumped on. I thought we were friends. I'm not anybody's friend. That was another one of your little fantasies. Wake the hell up. [music playing] Jerry, I'll have my regular. JERRY: Coming right up. Hello. Hi. You're Lorraine's friend. Yeah. Small world, huh? You like Jerry's coffee too? Mm-hm. Can I buy you a cup? Cappuccino? Mocha? No, thanks. No school today? DAWN COTTRELL: Yeah, sort of. Look, I know you came to see me the other night. What are you talking about? You had the urge to cut, but you tried to see me instead. Dawn, I have the feeling there are things you want to talk about, and I might be able to help you with. But not you. Why don't you come up to my office? When? Right now. I have an opening. Come on. [music playing] Nothing scary is gonna happen to you up there. All we're gonna do is talk. OK? I've gotta go. [music playing] [slamming drawers shut] Dawn? What are you doing? What is that? I can't do anything right. I can't keep a boyfriend. I can't keep any friends. Nobody likes me, daddy. Nobody likes me. That's ridiculous. That's ridiculous. Lots of people like you. Shoot. Teachers like you, your family likes you, your mother loves you, I love you. You do? Of course. How can you-- how could you even ask that? OK. It's OK. It's all right. Better? Look, high school's hard on a lot of people. Now, college, that's where a girl like you will really blossom. A girl like me? Yeah, a girl like you. Smart, hardworking. Everything's gonna be better in a few years. All right? OK. [music playing] Goodnight. Goodnight, daddy. [door closing shut] [dramatic music playing] [water running in sink] [door closing shut] RUSSELL COTTRELL: How was bridge night? Marge Harris was bragging about Monique. She made National Honor Society. Elaine Cook kept talking about Jamie. The coach is making him first team point guard. Then, of course, they asked me how Dawn was doing. A part of me just wanted to blurt it out and tell someone so I would have somebody to talk to about it. They made Jamie first team point guard? Didn't think he was that good. Where is she? She was just here. Dawn? [music playing] Dawn? [music playing] Are you sure she didn't leave? I was just talking to her. She was right here. Is she not in her room? No. Dawn? Dawn? [music playing] [tea kettle whistling] I checked there already. [tea kettle whistling] Dawn? Dawn? [tea kettle whistling] [music playing] Dawn? What are you doing in there? Are you cutting? Oh God. Dawn, stop it. JOYCE COTTRELL: Oh God. Out. Come on. Out. DAWN COTTRELL: Ow. DR. CHAPMAN: That hurt? Yes. Good. Supposed to. So you did this to yourself? The burns, those cuts in your arms and legs? It's OK, I need to ask for the records. Yes. The nurse will be here in a minute to bandage you up. I'm gonna go have a word with your parents. You're gonna need plastic surgery on those burns, otherwise the scars will be there forever. I don't mind. This is the first time I'm hearing about the cuts on the leg. What am I supposed to do? Examine every inch of her? And the burns-- why is she doing this? Well, there's a variety of reasons. In some cases it has its source in either physical abuse-- What? --or sexual molestation. Well, don't look at me. I have never laid a finger on that kid. Not in anger or any other inappropriate way. I think we'll all feel better if we have a professional evaluation of your daughter. You can use our staff psychiatrist or, uh, one of your own choosing. They're blaming this on us, you know? They think we're beating you, or God knows what. I didn't tell them that. Well, you know what? The doctor thinks you should see a therapist. And you're going, young lady. And when you go I want you to make it clear I never touched you. DAWN COTTRELL: Dr. Parella. What? I want to see Dr. Parella. Who is Dr. Parella? I'm having some tea. You want some? Juice? Water? Everything I say is private, right? That's right. You can't even tell my parents. That's like a state law or something. Nothing you say is going to leave this room. Because I'm telling you right now, I'm not stopping, and don't think you can make me. Oh. I can't make you do anything. Dawn, I know how precious your cutting is to you and I know you need it to help you cope with whatever it is you're going through. Right now what I have to offer you is gonna take some time. Yeah. What's that? Words. Language. We have to teach you how to speak. I know how to speak. You know how to talk, but you don't know how to express what's inside of you. You do your talking on your skin. Now look, these are some photos that were taken of you at the hospital. These here on your thigh, long, jagged. My guess is that you were really angry that day, out of control. Now, this on the other leg, I don't think you were that mad, just kind of irritated. You didn't start a new cut, just picked away at the old one. Now, these-- How'd you get to be such an expert? I do a lot of work with kids who have anorexia. I don't have that. No, you don't. But a long time ago, I noticed that a lot of them had scars on their bodies. Cuts, burns. They do? Yes, a lot of people cut themselves. Girls your age I'd say maybe one out of every 200. So you're not alone. Wow. Any of them ever do this? When did you do that? I don't know, a few days ago. Do you remember why? What triggered it? What difference does it make? You know, there are a lot of blood vessels under there. That could cause a lot of bleeding. So arm, leg, breast. It's my body and I'll cut where I want. TV HOST: Just how well your best friend really knows you. We're up to the $200 round and we'll start with Claire and Eddie. Now, Claire, we asked Eddie-- Alex, time for bed. It's only 9:30. JOYCE COTTRELL: And your bedtime's 9:00. All of a sudden because of her you guys you're acting weird. RUSSELL COTTRELL: Alex, don't start. Well, it's like this whole house is some kind of disease. Alex. Alex, I said that's enough. I'm tired, OK? I'm going to bed. OK, sweetheart. Go on up, I'll be right there. Goodnight, dad. Night, honey. JOYCE COTTRELL: Alex? [music playing] [knocking on door] Hi. DAWN COTTRELL: Hi. OK, let's do this. It's nice. How was your first session with Dr. Parella? OK I guess. Did she say anything about what's going on with you? Mom, it was just the first session. Did she say how long it will take before you're cured? Not exactly. Awhile. This is an old one, right? DAWN COTTRELL: Yeah. This is awful. Well, I can't sleep. I can't eat. Look at me, I'm a mess. I'm sorry, mom. I love you, Dawn. Anything you want, you know you just have to ask. You-- you know that, right sweetheart? What's this? If you keep this up I see no choice but to put you somewhere where they can take care of problems like this. Is that what you want? [door slamming shut] Anybody I've ever stood up to, anybody I've ever told what I felt, they left me. Yeah? Like who? Like a guy I'm seeing. From what you told me he wasn't there for you from the beginning. Just the sex. Lorraine that time she blew up at me. She got mad. She'll apologize, you'll see. But my mom-- if I ever told her how I really felt-- So what do you think? Is she a good mom? Yeah, I-- I think so. She tries. What does that mean? She does a lot with me. Takes me places, buys me things. But something is missing? Come on, what's missing? When she talks to me, it's not like she's talking to me. It's like she's talking to herself. I'd like her-- I'd like her to know me, to talk to me. And what's it going to take for her to be able to do that, for her to understand who you are? I don't know. Don't hide behind that. You know. What's it gonna take? To tell her how I feel. Right. You have to let her inside your world. You have to give her that chance. What if it just makes it worse? I know, it's scary, but I have to tell you, where you're heading with this cutting of yours, holding things in and then bleeding them out, that's a whole lot scarier. [music playing] Whatcha doing? Family photos. Some pictures I wanted you to see from Beaker Street. I've never seen these before. I know. OK. I know this is you, but who is this other girl? JOYCE COTTRELL: That was my sister. Your sister? Theresa. She died when she was five years old. What happened to her? We were playing on the front porch. My mother had put us there so she could take one of her naps. We started chasing each other around and Theresa saw something across the street and she ran. And I saw the car hit her and I saw how it rolled her, and I pulled her underneath. Mom. You know what I fear now? Any day you're gonna cut yourself in the wrong place, cut too deep, and I'll get blamed. I can't let that happen. Not again. I told Parella how I went off on you. Yeah. Your point? I freaked out, OK? Anyway, I remember you saying how much you like to skate, so I thought maybe you could teach me. [music playing] [screaming] So these carnival sets you're building, it's gonna take a team of engineers engineers to work on them. Shouldn't be that hard. You got the labor lined up? Not yet. Well, I know some guys in shop class that may be willing to put in the hours. Great. How'd you get that bruise? This guy my mom's been seeing. He just he smacks her around every now and then. I just got caught in the crossfire. Is that why you went off on me the other night? The stupid bitch is thinking about having a baby with him. So when you started talking about Craig, it was just blah, blah, blah, You know, it just all came out. Back on the blades. OK. OK. Trust me. Trust me. You gotta reach. Trust me. [music playing] Thanks. MIKE: Yeah. No problem Hey, what do you think? Oh, they're gorgeous. Yeah. I just need to put some teeth in there and stuff. Yeah. Maybe we could put some fangs. Yeah. Woof. Hey. If-- if you like, uh, my dad's got this Styrofoam gun and when we're all finished, uh, we can spray foam all over the trees and sets. Winter wonderland. Great. Thanks, Mike. My dad, he's, uh-- he's got this Styrofoam gun and we can spray foam everywhere. You I mean he's got a Styrofoam gun all right. He's got the hots for you. You think? Yeah. [music playing] We got bad hair today, or what? I don't know. You know, this is looking really great. It looks really good. Thanks. I love it. Uh, what do you think about the color? It's beautiful, Cottrell, or should I say Cutrell? CLASSMATE 2: Jamie Cook says you like to slice and dice. On your own skin. That is so beyond weird? So where do you do it? On your arms on your wrists? CLASSMATE 1: Oh. Come on, don't be shy. Let me see. I-- I really wanna see. Hey. You say so much as another word and you will know exactly how it feels, princess. You gonna be all right? [bell ringing] Dork. You mean you told Jamie's mother? One person. It slipped out. I'm supposed to keep this all bottled up inside? Mom, you knew she'd tell Jamie. Last night there were two more cuts, Dawn. You don't care what I think? All you care about is the other kids. I can't control what you do outside of this house. But if your secret's out, maybe peer pressure will stop you. On purpose? You did this on purpose? I told you we're gonna put an end to this. Whatever it takes. [UTENSILS CLANKING AGAINST DISHES] She never looks here. She never looks under my bra or panties. So you're playing hide and seek with your mom? She says if she finds anymore she's gonna send me to a mental hospital. Might help if your mom understood more about your behavior, if she had someone to talk to. She talks to everyone. That's how they found out. Well, I mean to a professional. DAWN COTTRELL: A shrink? Yeah. She would never see a shrink. Why not? She doesn't need to. She already knows everything. Well, what about your dad? Does she talk much to him? Do you talk to him? Are you two close? Yeah, close enough I guess. Does your dad show you a lot of affection? Dawn? Dawn, is there something about you and your dad you need to tell me? Does your dad ever touch you in a way that isn't appropriate? He doesn't touch me at all. DR. PARELLA: Never? It's like he's afraid of me. Well, that must feel awful. Was he ever affectionate with you? Did he ever hug and kiss you? A little when I was a kid. So you must feel like your growing up is a disaster. [music playing] Here's where she's cutting herself now. You're her father, you need to do something. She's in her room. [timer blaring] Dawn? It's OK, dad, come in. Dad? [music playing] Cut me. What? If it makes you feel better to cut something, cut me. It feels like you are anyway when you do it to yourself. [music playing] You're not the only one in pain. Your mother and I, we're-- well, you know that. I've been holding on here for you and Alex. [music playing] Please stop doing this. [door closing shut] Come on in. Hi, Mrs. Cottrell, Mr. Cottrell. I'm Jean Parella. Hi, Dawn. Why don't you take a seat wherever you want? Go on, just make yourself comfortable. I'll be right there. I made some tea if anybody'd like any. Thank you. Just help yourself. I'm really glad you could both be here today. I know it might feel a little uncomfortable. I'm sure it does for Dawn, but I think it's gonna go a long way toward helping your daughter. So why don't you tell me a little bit about yourselves, your home life? Me? My family? My family? Mm-hm. Well, uh, it's fine. We live in a beautiful home. Russell has a good job. Both the children do really well in school and this is really throwing us off. Is that the way you see things, Mr. Cottrell? Well, like we don't have any problems. Russell. I mean there are some tensions at home. Every couple has tensions. That doesn't make their children go running after knives. She's talking about real problems. Do you think there are any real problems at home, Mr. Cottrell? Well I'm sure Dawn's behavior has created some pressures at home. It's got to be very frustrating for both of you. No, frustrating is when the disposal gets jammed. My daughter cutting herself every other night is terrifying. Yes, it is. So how do we get her to stop? Well, unfortunately there is no one step immediate solution to this problem. For starters I'd like to prescribe some medication. You want to put me on pills? Yes, but they're not gonna make you tired or hyper or jittery. They're just gonna get rid of some of that static that's been playing around in your head. But eventually, it will get her to quit? No, not by themselves. I want to make this very clear, cutting is a very complicated and serious problem. We have a lot of work to do. Dawn, I want you to start carrying this whenever you're out. I want you to call me once an hour and let me know where you are. Mom. Wherever it is you sneak off to cut, you hit a vein, start bleeding, I want to know where you are. It's either that or stay at home. She did that to me. I told her to take their phone and shove it. How many friends do you have? What? Think about it a minute. How many friends have you got? I don't know. Frankie, Ken, guys at school, guys on the team. Lots. You have lots of friends, I have one. Maybe if she's in a good mood. So? So I've got one friend, and mom and dad. And if they ever split up-- They're mad at you, not each other. You don't know what you're talking about. If it gets bad enough, I've got nobody. Well, the way it is now with all the crap you take, you are nobody. So Cottrell, what are you gonna do now that you don't have your half dyke bodyguard to look out for you? What are you talking about? Lessy Lorraine. Got tough with the wrong guy. Stepped between her old lady and her biker stud. Greaseball beat her to a pulp. She's at St. Joe's on the tubes. Are you gonna cut yourself over this? You gonna psych yourself up? Can we watch? There she goes. Get the bandages. [music playing] - Mom? - What's wrong? Why aren't you in school? A friend of mine's in the hospital. What friend, Lorraine? She's in a coma. Her mother's boyfriend beat her up. Beat her up? What kind of friend is this? The only one I've got. Please mom, take me to the hospital. Seeing her is only going to upset you. DAWN COTTRELL: Please mom. I don't think Dr. Parella would think this is a good idea. Mom. Mom, take me to the hospital. I want to see my friend. When did you start raising your voice like that? I am trying-- I am trying to get you to hear me. You don't think I hear you? The past few weeks my life has been about nothing but you. You're not going to that hospital. In fact, you're not leaving this house. You're staying with me until you calm down. [slamming door shut] [music playing] Are you gonna make her stop? Alex. ALEX COTTRELL: Quit it, weirdo. JOYCE COTTRELL: If you can't control yourself go to your room. RUSSELL COTTRELL: Look, if it makes the kid feel better to rock, then just let her rock. [music playing] She was fidgeting. You were gonna send her to her room for fidgeting. I was just trying to get her to take control over her herself. Well she's not you, OK? She's not you? JOYCE COTTRELL: What is that supposed to mean? You tighten the screws and you tighten the screws and she's just getting worse. You're putting this on me? That night in the garage when she was burning her arm, whose attention do you think she was trying to get? You pushed me to take a stand. And when I take a stand you jump all over me. Oh yeah, you really take a stand around here. I don't want you contradicting me in front of the children anymore. Not ever. You got that? So what am I supposed to do? Just stand here and salute? I'm going out. Oh yeah, do what you do best, run. [music playing] You happy now, psycho? Did you hear him leave? It's because of you. [things being thrown around] It's all your fault. [things being thrown around] Next time you slice yourself, I hope you die. [door closing shut] [music playing] [phone beeping] Craig? Hi, it's Dawn. [music playing] Hello, Dawn. How are you? You said I could bring a friend, so I brought two. I hope that doesn't bother you in any way. Fine. So listen, Dawn, want a beer or something like that? No. Let's just do this. Good idea. BOY 1: Man, why is she all twitchy like that? Because man, she wants your body. Why do you care? BOY 1: What the hell are those? Told you she's like a razor freak. Does that bother you? BOY 2: It doesn't bother me. I'm into those nightmare movies. Here comes Freddy. Goodnight, son. Goodnight. [music playing] She's gone. RUSSELL COTTRELL: What? She's gone. [music playing] [sirens blaring] DR. MANN: It's right through here. When the boys came back to the apartment, this is how they found her, on the bathroom floor. [music playing] She's just gonna kill herself. It wasn't a suicide attempt, but she sure is trying to say something to somebody. I want those boys names The boys didn't do this, sir. They had sex with her. I don't care. I want to rip their guts out. [music playing] I'm sorry, mom. Got her strapped down here for God's sake. It's just to be sure she can won't cut herself again. RUSSELL COTTRELL: She's not an animal. Mr. Cottrell, you have to leave those in place. I'm sorry, it's for her own good. If you touch these again, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. I'm sorry. [music playing] Doctor said that, uh, you're gonna heal up with just a few marks. So you scared us. I'm sorry. Get some rest. I'll be back later. [door closing shut] Here, let me get back. Thanks. I've been thinking about how I can help you. I think the best thing that I can do is go away. What? Your father seems to think I'm the problem. He said that? Yeah. And I think you may feel the same way. And that's how you're gonna help me? By leaving? Nothing else seems to work, Dawn. The harder I try the worse it gets, and now this. I just can't do another thing for another person without getting help myself. This is what you do. This is what you always do. JOYCE COTTRELL: What? Make it seem like it's about me, but it's not. It's about you. In those 10 hours, from the time that you were gone until we got the call from the hospital, that was the worst agony of my life. See, always about you. Well, if living apart from you is the only way that I can help you, that what I'm gonna do. Just go, dammit. Go. I'll be staying at Cindy's for awhile. Leave! [door closing shut] [music playing] Dawn? I wish you'd called me. She's leaving. Who? My mother. I am so sorry. She told me she didn't know what else to do but leave. So I yelled at her, told her she should just go ahead and go. For some reason it doesn't feel as bad as I thought it would. Dawn, it's not your fault. [crying] It's OK. It's OK. Yeah. Crying is good, Dawn. If you're crying, you're not cutting. You have a good beginning. It's good. [music playing] [car door closing] Here. I'll take the bag. You know I've got some work to do. So uh, I'm gonna go back to the office. I'll be about an hour, all right? You'll be OK? Yeah. OK. [door closing shut] [knocking on door] Come in. When I said I hope you die, I didn't mean it. I know. [music playing] She won't come back again until you stop. I'm trying, Alex. I'm trying. Come here. It's OK. [music playing] [knocking on door] Come in. Your mother didn't leave because of you. She left because of me, and for good reason. I was never there for her and I haven't been there for you. [music playing] Dad, I'm still not getting anywhere with these logarithms. I guess I better show you how it's done then, huh? Hey. Hey. Oh well, aren't we a pair? How are you? Well, I'm conscious. I guess that's a plus. And your mom's boyfriend, is he in jail? 30 days, and she is thinking about breaking up with him. Here, I brought this for you. Oh wow, it's beautiful. it's way too nice for Rebecca, that's for sure. Yeah. Well she gets all the glory anyway. Ugh, she's gonna need it. What do you mean? Everything that makes her life beautiful, it's all happening now. But for you and me, our time is coming.
