foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- A lot of people look at me as a loser. I can understand that. [SIGHS] A lot of people think I was sleeping with Martha for the money. And at first, yeah, they were right. She was old enough to be my mother. But the financial aspects of our relationship grew less important until, I swear to God, I didn't care about the money. You see, Martha gave me... She gave me a new way of looking at my life. And then, just when she was showing me how I didn't have to fuck up everything I came in contact with... she died. [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING] [♪♪♪] [DOG BARKS] [ROOSTER CROWS] [THUDS] Excellent. Excellent. How you doing? Great. Oh, God. Jesus. Good morning. Bus is what time? Seven thirty. Right. You're gonna talk to Sam, right? Whatever happened to "good morning, Dad"? Good morning, Dad. "Are you gonna talk to Sam? Are you gonna talk to Sam?" What are you, a broken record? That's a mouth-- That's a mouth that could get you killed in some neighborhoods. Don't be a "wise guy," wise guy. Talk to Sam, all right? And burn your own toast. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] Tough guy. [♪♪♪] Morning, Lex. Morning, Max. Good morning, Sam. How much? Just fine. Fine. Thanks for asking. How are you this morning? How much? Will you let me in? How much? [DOOR SQUEAKS OPEN, CLOSES] That's confidential. [DOOR SQUEAKS OPEN, CLOSES] Look, de Carlo, I knew Martha when she's 18. I know exactly how you got that money. But believe me, this is, and I have no idea how much she left you, the most overpriced fuck anybody I know personally has ever paid for. I need an advance on future sales. What future sales? You couldn't sell a mobile home if it were stuffed with 10s and 20s. Things are slow. Maybe because we live in the desert. Hey, come on, Sam. How much did she leave you? You're about to lose a good salesman. Ooh! [LAUGHING] Forty thousand. Oh, my God. When I said "overpriced," I had no idea. Yeah. Well...you can't take it with you, huh? I need 200. What do you say? Okay. Two hundred. [SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] CARMINE: After Martha died, I couldn't exactly get psyched up about selling mobile homes. [GRUNTS] I hung around the pool a lot, just killing time. [♪♪♪] Come on, Martha. MARTHA: Why did you come here, Carmine? What were you running away from? CARMINE: My family. Family? My past. It has a problem staying where it belongs. We all have a past. Hm. Not like mine. MARTHA: You still have Max to think about. [MARTHA SIGHS] CARMINE: Yeah. I still have Max to think about. Put some water on for tea, Carmine, please. Oh, also, you could toast some bread for sandwiches. [CHUCKLES] [THINGS RUSTLING IN KITCHEN] I gotta be out of my mind. [CHILDREN SCREAMING, PLAYING] Hey! Hey! CARMINE: Martha's daughter, Lexie, came back for the funeral and parked her trailer across the way. Hot enough for you? Maybe to just bust my balls. One thing I used to bank on was my golf game. But since Martha died, I was even losing to a stoop like Cecil. [CHUCKLES] Jesus. For a golf hustler, you're a pretty lousy golfer, Carmine. You're a humble champion, Cecil. Well, you owe me a lot of money. What are you gonna do about it? I sold a double-wide last week and Sam is way behind in his commissions. [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] CARMINE: I wanted to get over Martha, but having her daughter across the way kept bringing back memories. LEXIE: Ah, you really can ride. [STEVE CHUCKLES] Okay. Thanks. STEVE: So when your brother said you were back in town, I thought I wanted to see you again. Yeah? And remember that time over there, you told me you wanted to dance and... then we kissed? Who? You and I? Kissed? No way, Steve, we did not. STEVE: Yeah, your friend Roxanne kept bugging me about it. Roxanne. Right. Did you think we're lesbians? [LAUGHING] No. Steve? Did you? Most people did. She is a dancer. STEVE: Really? LEXIE: Mm-hm. Topless. [♪♪♪] [SIGHS] MARTHA: Lexie wrote again from New York. It's hard to know where she's gonna be next. You'd like my daughter, Carmine. Yeah? Why is that? She's full of love just like you. It's no good when it stays inside. How do I keep it inside? You're a tough guy. Why is it all tough guys are so afraid of love? I don't know. Maybe 'cause one day you're the bird, and then one day you're the windshield. [LAUGHING] [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] [SLOT MACHINES BEEPING] Hey! Hey, no! That's my car, no! Hey! That's my car, no! Hey! Stop! Damn it! I was only inside for a minute! Hi, my name is Charles. I'm an alcoholic and a compulsive overeater and a compulsive gambler. And also, I'm a member of the Rotary. Recently, I found that my compulsion to drink has changed into another addiction. Doughnuts. [GROUP LAUGHS] To be specific, Dunkin' Donuts. To be really specific, a certain glazed Dunkin' Donut. It's actually a cruller. It's not a doughnut. And it's got this custard and it's delish. Sometimes I don't eat the custard, I just scoop it out. I know it seems like a stupid thing to be obsessing on, but I'd much rather be obsessing on doughnuts than act the way I used to act. I mean, now, my kids, their worst fear is having me wake them up in the middle of the night to go on a midnight doughnut run instead of terrorizing them the way I used to. So that's what I thought tonight's topic would be. How do we look for happiness and get out of our own way... now that we don't drink anymore? Thanks for letting me share. [GROUP APPLAUDS] Would anybody like to start? Okay. Hi, my name is Lexie, and I'm an alcoholic. GROUP: Hi, Lexie. I think I look for happiness by pulling a geographical. I move a lot. Now that I'm back where I grew up, I'm kind of looking back on this trail of all these places I've moved to, and I don't know why. When things get tough, I move. I like moving. But I guess the older I am, happiness is harder to find once I get there. CHARLES: Amen. [GROUP APPLAUDING] The reason I move isn't always because I'm looking for happiness. The reason I move is because I might actually find it right where I am. Amen. Thank you. Would our-- Would our latecomer friend--? Would you like to share? CARMINE: Hi. My name is Carmine. GROUP: Hi, Carmine. And I'm an alcoholic. My son, Max, doesn't like it when I drink... but I drink. I don't like it when I drink. I didn't wanna get my car towed tonight. I didn't wanna have to take the bus and walk home, but I parked it in a red zone. I don't know why I can't seem to get out of my own way. That's it. [GROUP APPLAUDING] CARMINE: Hey, Lexie. LEXIE: Uh! Give me a break. Hey, hi. Hi. I can use a ride. But you parked in a red zone with my mother's car. That was bright. Didn't tell you to park in the red zone with my mother's car. I wasn't looking for a driver's ed Class. I just spilled my guts out in there. And you wanna ride home with me? I don't think so. Hey, I was looking for a ride, not a date. How am I supposed to know? A ride. I was looking for a ride. No. You know, your mother had a lot going for her! Too bad a little bit of it didn't rub off! [♪♪♪] Whatever you do, don't touch him. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Mr. de Carlo. Who the hell are you? What's going on here? Would you like to know? Jesus, Harvey, you scared me to death! Harvey. This is my attorney, Kreimach. Deal with him, you shit bag. Kreimach, was it? Kreimach. Don't try to telephone my client, Mr. de Carlo. You're not getting a dime my mother left, you gigolo bastard. Will you knock it off, huh? What my client is trying to say is that he doesn't feel that you have any legal entitlement to Mrs. Brandstein's estate. Does he have any legal right to say this? Well, we feel that Martha Brandstein was not of sound mind when she made up her will. What are you talking about? She was fine. She was in great shape. What are you talking about? That was my mother. Mr. Brandstein, please. You're going to have to prove this in a court of law. With what, huh? I don't have a lawyer. Lawyers cost money. The whole point is I don't have any fucking money! Yeah, whose fault is that? See you in court. Court, huh? Yeah. We'll be in touch, Mr. de Carlo. Yeah. Touch this. Harvey. [MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCTLY ON SPEAKERS] Jesus. Not quite, but I'm working on it. What are you doing here, Frank? I want you to come home. Well, we don't have far to go because I live here. [SCREEN DOOR CREAKS OPEN] How the hell did he find us? Nice to see you too, kid. My mother here? Hey, why don't you go play on the turnpike for about a half an hour? Max, go back to bed. I'm okay. Go back to bed. He's a real de Carlo, my little nephew. What do you want, Frank? Guess who's the new head of the Sanitation Department. I don't know. John fucking Rizzo. [CHUCKLES] Jesus. Rizzo hates your guts. No shit? Maybe that's why I can't get any city business. Do you blame him? He's scared. I'm scared myself. Hey, Pop ran a different kind of business. Can we move into the 20th century here? I can't talk to Rizzo, you can. I gave you my share of the business. Garbage ain't what it used to be, Carmine. Yeah? How much can it change, huh? What about you? You live in a dump like this? At least I don't have to hurt people. Who's talking about hurting anybody? I'm talking about coming home, huh? I'm talking about family. CARMINE: Family. Five years ago, he steals my wife, and now he talks to me about family. I'm in Vegas on business. In two weeks, we go home together. And if I don't? HARVEY: I don't get it. I don't understand it. Help me out here. This guy is ruining my dream. Would you relax? You're gonna have a stroke. He hustles old women! You hustle golf. He fucked Mom! He helped with the funeral. She cut us out of the will! [GRUNTS] Oh, God. [GASPS] Harvey, Harvey, Harvey. I'll let the lawyers get it all before I bend over and let that scumbag make a mockery of my dream. [FLAMES CRACKLING] Fire! Fire! Max! Max! [MUTTERING] Max, are you here? He's not here, thank God. [♪♪♪] Come on, come on. Damn it. [GRUNTS] [METAL CREAKING] Quite a bonfire, Dad. Max. Oh! God. Where have you been? I was at Phyllis', all right? Is that everything we own? CARMINE: Yeah. Great. I'm going back to sleep. Crispy Critters, huh? Tough break, Carmine. Yeah. Are you insured? Get out of here, Mike. It's not insured, babe. Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Carmine. Huh? Do you have a place to sleep, sweetheart? Yeah, Grace. Thank you. [SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTIANCE] [♪♪♪] [COUGHS] What's up? Okay, okay, I'll tell you what's up. Harvey wants to plow under our place and build Little Vegas. I know, I know, I need somebody, Syl, but you can't find those type people by looking in the Yellow Pages. CARMINE: You kick me again, Sam, I'm gonna feed you that shoe for breakfast. I hear Mutt and Jeff paid you a visit last night. Harvey's a weasel. He does, however, have good taste in lawyers. Yeah, tell me about it. [SPEAKS IN YIDDISH] You've lost already. You owe me for the trailer. You ought to pay me for putting it out of its misery. SAM: Right, so clean up, come over and see me. [GLASS CRUNCHES] Nu? Carmine, my boy. Want a cocktail? It's 8:30 in the morning. It's at least 5:00 in China. Yeah, what do you want? Come, take a walk with me. SAM: Sylvia, Martha, my partner Saul and I came out here when Vegas was just a dream of Bugsy Siegel and other now deceased Jews. Long before you olive oil types ruined it. CARMINE: Sam had dug himself a deep hole. The only way out was to pull a scam, but he needed an accomplice. Someone to blame if things went sour. In the old days, he used Martha's husband. Now he was trying to use me. When you look out over that trailer park, what do you see? A godforsaken shithole. All right, fair enough. Now he thinks he's the reincarnation of Bugsy Siegel. Who? Harvey Brandstein. Oh, God. I sold him the land for the golf course. Like a yutz, I also sold him the option to everything you see out there, the spa, my home, my life. The option lasts till the end of the month, less than two weeks from now. His dream is to rip down my eyesore and build Little Vegas. Little Vegas? A bigger, much more impressive eyesore. Well, what's he gonna use to purchase Little Vegas with? Mafia moolah, Carmine. The family. You are familiar with the family, are you not? You want me to get him the loan? No, you stupid putz. Goodbye. Sorry. I want you to make sure he never sees that loan. I'd like to help you, but I'm not exactly the first person that la famiglia checks with when looking to purchase real estate. I didn't say it was gonna be easy, I can give you money if you help me. You're a real Donald Trump. I could maybe scrape together about 25, 30G's. I don't think so. He's looking for 190G's option money to keep his big dream alive. He's dead without that loan. Look, Carmine, if he picks up this property, I have life in a nursing home to look forward to. I'm not talking about homicide here. All we have to do is stall him till the 1st, then he has no right to pull this place out from under me. What do you think? I think I wanna think about it. So who's gonna fuck me next? I mean, Sam wasn't the most honest guy to go into business with. Who is? But Harvey torched my trailer. Still, using my family name to stall Harvey was a stupid move, and potentially suicidal. You see, Sam and my brother are both hoods. The only difference is Sam's not a pro, which means that I could never count on Sam to stand up for me, but I could count on my brother to kill me. Shit. Why do I keep making the same mistakes over and over and over again? Oh, Gargoyle? Do you realize in a few years we'll never be able to pull this shit off? Ketchup, please. MAN [OVER PA]: Phil to the pro shack. Phil to the pro shack. Take the governor off that baby, it'll fly. Totally power it, maybe kamikaze into the tree. Kamikaze? You kids must do all right selling those golf balls. Hi, Harvey. You've got some Swedish meatballs, a little pasta, it looks good. What are you two outlaws up to today? Not much. How about yourself? Still teaching these fucking retards how to hit a golf ball. Sounds like a pain. Oh, I don't mind. It's all part of owning a successful operation. What I do mind is, well, you know. What? Keeping you from selling used golf balls within chipping distance of the pro shop. Used golf balls for a buck fifty apiece with little help-me-I'm-a-starving-child looks on your faces, while inside, inside I sell new ones for 250. But it's a different story when you sign the lunch check "Mr. Gilligan and Mrs. Howell." I start to feel like somebody's making me out to be an idiot. A dipshit. A douchebag. I don't pay myself a big salary to be a douchebag. Well, don't stop eating. I want you to finish it, enjoy it. I'll just...take these and do this. Ow! If it happens again, you'll be two sorry castaways. Shit. You okay, Max? I hate that guy. [♪♪♪] I think that's it. Kamikaze. What? The tree! Hit the tree! You've gotta be crazy. If I were driving, I'd hit the tree. And we'd be dead. So? MIKE: Max is a good kid. Take an AK-47 to get him to say anything bad about you. P.J. and I was just saying sometimes it's hard to tell who's the parent and who's the kid here. Yeah, I am, Mike. I'm the parent. Look, Carmine, I know this is none of my business, but... Max has been staying over at our house and, uh, what's gonna happen if you don't get that money? You're right, Mike. It is none of your business. I'll get the money, and you'll be reimbursed for every Twinkie that Max ever lifted from your cupboard. P.J. and I feel that if it comes down to it, we're ready to take him in. Yeah? Why? Because we like him. That's his job, Mike, to make sure everybody likes him. Don't be fooled by the fact that he's young, healthy, good-looking, kindhearted and intelligent. We're just worried. Yeah, well, don't. Did you hear they dropped the price on propane again? No kidding? Listen, do me a favor, if you see Einstein, will you send him home? Sure. [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] [♪♪♪] [KNOCKS] [KNOCKS] Windows. Windows? My father was a traveling salesman. He used to sit up nights talking about how to sell. The thing they talked about most was how to read a window. If you wanted someone to buy, all you had to do was wait for that right window to open up, and if you were patient, it would. When it did, you'd stick a bit of yourself in, you could sell them the world. It's just a complex. I've done all right in real estate. So how is your dad? Dead. I don't know. Not right now. Okay, okay. [SIGHS] Thanks for dinner. Sure. [ENGINE STARTS] Watch that speed limit. You bet. No, no, Joey, Joey, it's more like Frankie Five Fingers these days. Yeah. Yeah. Huh? I'm eating a lot of carrots to make up for my loss of sight. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Yeah, well-- Yeah, that's right, Joe. Yeah, that's why I called. Yeah, listen, hey, uh, ahem, I'm gonna be flush in a couple of weeks, but I need about five or six bills to cover me so I can get some legal representation-- Hey! Ow! Chrissake! You made me swallow my gum, damn it. Sounded like a desperate phone call from a desperate man. That was a long-distance call. Long distance is expensive, you already owe me 100. I was trying to get it. You were the one that wanted to play 10 bucks a hole. Well, I had a bad day, what can I tell you? How about if we play tomorrow? Double or nothing. Come on, Cecil, take a chance. Columbus did. Okay. But if you don't win, I might be the next one to burn down your domicile. [WATER RUNNING] Do you want a nice cocktail to go with that ice, Carmine? You don't drink, Grace. A girl's gotta start sometime. I need you, Carmine. I've got business I have to take care of. Look, Carmine, I'm really ready and I'm really ready to pay. Grace? Really ready. I sell mobile homes. I don't do that anymore. Martha's dead, she'd never know. It's got nothing to do with Martha. For 200 bucks? No, I can't do it. Nope. [♪♪♪] It's all I ever drink. CARMINE: Sam never got over the guilt of cheating Martha's husband. But I happen to know from personal experience, that guilt doesn't stop a guy from making the same mistake twice. I would have never fucked you, Saul, you know that. But when you have to weigh what's good for three other people on your own scale, it can be a heavy burden. All right, have a little swallow, so I don't drink so... Sam, come on. Don't argue, Saul. Both of us will feel better. [BOTTLE THUDS] Uh, hello. Look, I hope you don't mind. Max and I needed a place to live. I mean, after my joint burnt down, I... I just-- I haven't looked inside since I moved away. When did you go away, huh? When I was 16, as far as I got was Vegas. Yeah. It must have been quite an education. No. At the time, I thought I knew everything anyway. I wanted to say thank you... for helping with my mother's funeral. My brother should've helped. Yeah, well, your brother's a... An asshole. I know. Yeah, well, you know, it happened so suddenly. I... I lost touch with my mother. [SCREEN DOOR CREAKS OPEN] No, you know, she talked about you a lot. [SCREEN DOOR CREAKS CLOSED] [SAM MUTTERS] [SAM SINGING INDISTINCTLY] He double-crossed his best friend. My father. Yeah. My mother told you? No, I read it in her diary. You what? [CHUCKLES] You read my mother's diary? Look, it gets slow out here in the middle of nowhere. I-I mean, your mother never said, "If I should happen to die, please don't read my diary." Well, then, you're a weird guy, Carmine. Yeah, well, I-- I've been called worse. [SAM SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] [SINGING INDISTINCTLY] He thought Bugsy Siegel was a saint. You were a Girl Scout? I spent my life in garbage collection. Oh, I'm sorry. Garbage collection in New Jersey. I know people who have been convicted for less. Hey, Lexie? You wanna go out for a cup of coffee? Yeah, okay. We used to hang out in our trailer. Really? Yeah. She'd be baking. Grace? Big cakes, cookies. It was 120 degrees to begin with. Heh! Oh, my God. She'd slip us beers and make us sit and listen to stories of Vegas in the good old days. Yeah, it was a great place to grow up. I'll bet. How did you end up here? Oh, never really liked doing what I was doing back in Jersey. Which was? Garbage collection. Right. You see, I used to come out here every once in a while, on business. Vegas is the only place I knew besides where I grew up. Did you like where you grew up? Well, I don't think where you grow up matters all that much. What matters? Your family. The people you grew up with. I thought I knew what a family was. Yeah, I think about that a lot, and with a kid. Exactly. You see, I didn't want Max to grow up doing... garbage collection. Do you like it here? Well, I'd like it a lot better if I could get on my feet... Get out of you own way? Exactly. Exactly. Oh, man, I missed the boat. I missed the boat on the big family reunion. You were an important part of her life. Yeah. I just thought, someday I would come back and my mother and I would straighten everything out. I was so mad when I left. You were 16 years old, right? That's what 16-year-old girls are. Well, I'm not 16 anymore, am I? Listen, Lex... I appreciate you being so nice considering I... Slept with my mother? Right. Sure. Good night, Carmine. Good night, Lexie. [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] You don't understand him, Martha. He's an angry man. He'd kill me if he thought I was standing in the way of a city contract. He'd murder his own brother? Apparently, you're not acquainted with what he's already done to much better friends. Cheers. How are you gonna fix what he's done to you? Either I fix him, or he fixes me. That's anger talking to anger. No, that's me talking to my brother. Do you love him? Well, I suppose. I don't know, sure, yeah. Some distant, hateful way. Then forgive him. What? Forgive him. [CAR APPROACHING] Hey, Carmine, que fa? [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Nice place you got here. Oh, the Japanese garden, that is a very nice touch. [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] What do you use for fertilizer? Jimmy Hoffa? CARMINE: You guys want some coffee? Yeah, you got some? Bobby, why don't you go inside, take a dump or something. So Johnny Rizzo sends you his best. What's that supposed to mean? It means he didn't send me his best. I can't get through to that stugots. Frank...guys don't forget when you pin 'em down, wait till they scream, and spit down their throat. Well, that was 30 years ago. Well, I still remember every time you did it to me. But you thought you were just some kid being an asshole. Yeah, who knew that this shrimp bambito's gonna become the head of the entire Sanitation Commission? He could ruin me. I am this far from sending his ass to the bottom of a landfill. You'd do that to Rizzo? What do you think? If you didn't come home with me, it's my only choice. Hey, hey, guys, what's up, huh? I'm having a talk with my brother here. BOBBY: We've gotta go. Two weeks, Carmine. Okay? BOBBY: Come on, I'm hungry. Okay, Frank. BOBBY: Let's go. Come on. Let's go grab a couple of omelets. See you, Carmine. [CAR DOOR OPENS] Come on, Frank, lighten up. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [CAR DRIVES OFF] I'm in. What? I said, I'm in. That's great. Hold Rifka while I get us a cocktail. Oh, Jesus Christ, Sam. Don't make any sudden moves. Now I can tell you about the safe. What safe? Harvey's safe. Sam, I'm not a thief. Ha! Don't make me laugh. Harvey's trying to cut you out of the will. Think about Max. You can't put him through college selling mobile homes. Okay, okay, when? A week from tonight. That'll take his option till the end of the month. [SNAKE TAIL RATTLES] Rifka's a rattlesnake. Yeah, that's right. [SNAKE TAIL RATTLES] Please take him. He likes you. Yeah. Hey, Lex. Hello, officer. Take good care of these guys. Oh, yeah. Love them and leave them. When do you go? I don't know. Soon, maybe. Yeah, well... we'll miss you around here. There are few things I'll miss about this place. Hope I'll be one of them. Oh, you will be. MAN [OVER PA]: Ralph Ramsey, you have a phone call. Ralph Ramsey, a phone call. Florida's not such a bad place. Compared to here, it's a vacation wonderland. [CHUCKLES] I'm gonna be making $100,000 a year, not including health benefits or bonus packages. I'm not a window or a real estate deal. A window doesn't have to be a deal. You're you. I love you. Just like that? When it's open, it's open, just like that. [CLICKING] Hi. I'm the security guard. Can I help you? My family. My family. We're giving Harvey cash for this Little Vegas deal. Uh... I'm supposed to check out the safe, you know, make sure it's acceptable. You keep all your dough in there? Sure. It's our safe. Jesus H. Christ. Hey, Lexie. Excuse me. Goddamn it! [KNOCKING] Whatever you're selling, get lost. I'll come back later. Oh, I hate my life. Sorry about earlier. Yeah, right. I wasn't expecting. Steve-- He seems like an upbeat guy for a cop. He does accounting too. Accounting? [CHUCKLES] In Las Vegas? [LAUGHING] I know guys who've been convicted for less than that. [♪♪♪] Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Max, right? That's right. Your father dates Lexie? Lexie? Uh... No. Don't think so. Where you headed? You know, usual place to do my homework or something. [FORCED CHUCKLE] [BOTH CHUCKLE AWKWARDLY] How do you know when the windows open? A guy like you would just know. That's the beauty of windows. You just know. If you can look whoever it is in the eye, and at the right moment, give a little bit of yourself... you can sell 'em the world. The world? The world. I gotta tell you about windows. Forget about the windows. Go to school. And learn what? Max, it's time for homework. Homework? Are you kidding? I've never done homework. There's a first time for everything. Carmine. Max, either you hit the books, or I'm gonna hit you. Capiche? Capiche. Carmine, relax. He'll be fine. I grew up in this park, and Harvey used to be a cheesy little weasel. Yeah, maybe you'd better keep an eye on him. How did your mother handle it? She drank like a fish. So I'll see you later? Yeah, that'd be nice. [♪♪♪] MARTHA: I started drinking when Saul left. CARMINE: Why? MARTHA: The excuse I gave myself was, well, I was the only one who knew that Sam was crossing Saul, but I couldn't say anything. We can all find an excuse. If we don't fix our past, it'll wreck our future. How are you doing? I came-- I came to pick up my car. This Thunderbird right over here. I don't see so good, but you're no Martha Brandstein. I'm her son. You got ID? Yeah, I sure do. Here you go. De Carlo isn't a Brandstein. She remarried. I'm sorry, she's gonna have to come pick up the car. That's impossible. Three fifty a day storage fee. That could be a long time. This desert ain't going no place. How about if I just take it? How about if I hit you with this pipe? Oh, God. Hot enough for you? Hi. Hi. Where you going, to the pool? No, there's a spring I go to in the hills. Yeah? Do you wanna go? Yeah, sure. I'll get my suit. It's up in the hills, you don't need a suit. Oh. This is gonna be, uh, an au naturel type of thing? Could be. Guess I'm set. [♪♪♪] What happened to Max's mother? She left. Why? Money. The guy she left with had plenty of it. I'm usually the one who leaves. That's comforting. Uh-huh. I mean, comforting to the guys, you know, you're involved with. I didn't say I was proud of it. Maybe I didn't have a good enough reason for staying. Maybe you did and you didn't know it. How much further is this place? LEXIE: About 20 miles. CARMINE: What? [♪♪♪] Here it is. Looks interesting. Ah, perfect. Good. If you wanna wear your underwear, that's fine. No, no, I wouldn't think of it. [GRUNTS] Ow. How is it? Pretty spectacular. [QUIETLY] Uh-huh. [CHUCKLING] I'm glad you think this is amusing. You know, we don't have too many of these outdoor-type activities back in Jersey. I'll be all right as soon as I get in. Oh, it's cold. You can stop laughing now. [CHUCKLING] I'm sorry. I know you grew up here, out West, but when I take my clothes off with a female, it means I'm gonna do more than take a bath. Sorry, I didn't know it was gonna be hard for you. [SCOFFS] [LAUGHS] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've got a hard-on. [LAUGHS] I'm sure you've seen somebody with this type of problem before. Nowhere near as charming as you are. Good answer. So is this all we do? Just sit here naked? And wait for the moon. Should I, uh... maybe make a move? Make a move? Well, out West, they sit in these deals. In Jersey, we make moves. I know what a move is. Well, should I? Make a move? Yeah, I think so. [♪♪♪] [GASPS] You're wonderful. Well, I never had a woman leave me because I wasn't wonderful. You might end up in my will too. [BOTH LAUGH] Sorry. No, that's all right. Look-- It happened. Okay. Yeah, it happened. We all have a past, Carmine. I'll see you tomorrow? How can you be so nice when you know I'm going away? Maybe 'cause I know you're going away. If you're going away, how come you're so nice? Maybe because I'm going away. I'm telling you, I can't do it. Harvey's her brother. Can't you keep it in your pants five minutes, Carmine? You're a tender guy, Sam. You love her? Yeah. Oh, boy. You don't wanna walk into a relationship without a dime. When it's her brother who's holding out on you. Oh, Jesus. Get the money from the safe. It's yours anyway. You won't be sending me to the nursing home. You've got the knife in. You wanna turn it three times now? Go through it again, Bethanne. So? So there's not much of a story to tell. My brother wants me to go back. I don't want to. So you got your cannoli in the vise? Yeah, sort of. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Listen, Bobby, I need you to take a phone call for me. Not the phone call. Yeah, the phone call. And there's something else too. Frank doesn't know about the phone call. Is that okay? Okay. Hey, thanks. I mean, he's not the only one who wants you to come home. When this individual calls you, tell him to speak to me and no one else. Okay. And if Frank finds out about this, he's gonna cut off our cannolis and he's gonna serve them at a rotary luncheon. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] Naked help is so difficult to find today. The de Carlo family? I went to a lot of people, but I never thought of the de Carlo family. You want the money, don't you? Yeah, but I had no idea they'd send you. You and I know each other. You and I don't like each other. That may be true, but this is business, and this also means you can't go anywhere else for the financing. You call downtown, you ask for Bobby de Carlo. On Thursday, you throw a party, you invite the world, and that's when we'll bring the cash. This has been my dream. Do me a favor. Keep this between you and I. I keep everything in the family. Between you and I. I don't want your sister to know I'm still working for the boys back East. Why? Oh, God, you're not actually fucking my sister. Are you, Carmine? Keep it to yourself, Harvey. Capiche? [GROANS] SAM: Down there's where 40 years ago, Saul and I hit one of Luciano's armored cars. 'Cause he knocked off Bugsy Siegel? Partly. Partly because we wanted what was inside the armored car. Is that when you crossed Saul? Martha told you that? No. She never told anyone that. But she knew, didn't she? Yeah. Saul was a schlimazel. In the middle of the job, he wet his pants. But I lied to myself when I said I deserve more because it was my idea. I waited for one of Luciano's boys to show up one day and say, "We know who you are, Sam." Funny thing is, after all these years, I thought you might be that guy. [LAUGHS] Come on, Sam. Those guys are all dead and gone. You don't know what it feels like to admit that to somebody. I like you, Carmine. What? I was wrong to call you a Stupid Diego. I'd lay off the sauce if I were you, Sam. Why would I lie to you? Why would you like me? Because you're the closest thing I have to a friend. I'm not that much of a friend. Didn't think much about my friends till they were gone. I didn't think all that much about my wife till she was dead. I came out here, thought this place was a shithole, just like you. Make the best of your home because it's all you got. Now, you should also make the best of the family that you've concocted, because that's all you got. [EAGLE CRYING] [♪♪♪] LEXIE: Carmine? CARMINE: Yeah. LEXIE: I saw stars. In fact, I think I still see stars. [CHUCKLES] I used to spend so much time up here, thinking of all the unbelievable things I could give the world when I ran away. I wanted to dance. And what happened? I never danced. But I did find there were a lot of people interested in a 16-year-old who was willing to give away unbelievable things. Now I don't give anything to anybody. When I go away, I want you and Max to go with me. Yeah? Where would we go? I don't know. Somewhere. Somewhere where we can get out of our own way? -The only problem is... there's no place we can go where my brother Frank couldn't find us. [♪♪♪] Why are you conscious? I got anxiety. What anxiety? I don't wanna move from here, Carmine. Oh, now you like it here. Yeah, sure, works for me. Go to sleep. I'll think about it. Think about it, okay? Okay. I'll think about it. Works for me. MARTHA: "For the first time since Saul left, "which means the first time in a long time, "I've been seeing another man. "His name is Carmine. "He's been running from his family in New Jersey. "In a lot of ways, he's like my husband. "Kindhearted, handsome, a little brash. "To tell you the truth, "a little better in bed than Saul. "But the one thing I worry about "is that Carmine has the same inclination "to do things illegally. "He doesn't know any other way to make a living. "Either he changes and gets on with being the man he can be, "or he doesn't. Saul never did." Martha said that since I was born a de Carlo, the only way I could be free is if I would stop being afraid of my family. She said I should forgive them. Which was pretty good advice, provided my brother stayed in Jersey. [♪♪♪] Well, here I am again, Syl. I'm back in business with a friend. CARMINE: Using my family name was a roll of the dice. But attempting to hit the safe at the same time was like going for a hole in one. If Harvey ever looked in that briefcase, minchia, I'd be licking my ass off a wall. This is for the party. This is for you. Thank you. Shall I? Listen, Lexie. I'm gonna be getting some family money tonight. Soon as I get it... let's get out of here. What do you say? Move? I thought we're-- I'm worried about my brother. Okay, it's my specialty. So, uh, see you later. Thank you. Sam? Listen, do me a favor, if something happens, make sure that Max and Lexie get the money. Fine. Do you want a drink? Yeah. Yeah, maybe later. [MARIACHI BAND PLAYING] [MAN SINGING IN SPANISH] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Hi. Carmine! Hey, Carmine! I'll see you later. Hey, I just wanted you to know right from the get-go that I'm sorry I didn't put the De Carlo name together with, you know, heh, De Carlo. Right, well, not many people do. I'm sorry. I want you to know that I'm glad to know we're doing business. I got a dream out here, Carmine. I could use a guy like you. It's gonna be a regular little Vegas. Casinos, motor inns, shopping centers, condominiums-- I've got the money. You got the money? Yeah, what are you, deaf? I've got the money. Can we put it somewhere? You bet. Let's go upstairs. Bobby's up there with a hooker named Charity. Wanna know why they call her Charity? I heard, Harvey. I heard. I don't mind telling you, Carmine, this money comes in the nick of time. Another day, I'd be dead in the water. [SAFE DIAL CLICKING] [SIGHS] There, safe and sound. [THUNDER RUMBLES] Boy, we got to watch that buffet table, it's supposed to rain tonight. [MARIACHI BAND CONTINUES PLAYING] You trying to get your father murdered? I'm trying to get something to eat. Couldn't you have hung out at the back door? I would have brought you food. I'm not the backdoor kind of guy, Dad. That's a nice suit, by the way. Listen, I don't wanna cramp your style, but will you get the fuck out of here before I kick you in the ass in front of God, Harvey Brandstein, and the world. Andiamo, get out of here. You know these two turds? Yeah, I've seen them around. Show them the business end of a nine iron. It's not worth it, Harvey. I'll take care of it, okay? Yeah, Harvey. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Thanks. Thanks a lot. [♪♪♪] Oh, Christ. [SIGHS] Jesus. Oh, forgive me. [GULPS, SIGHS] Gin. Here we go. [MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY] Forty-two. Hold on. Oh, shit. Mr. De Carlo. There's no money in the safe. Yeah, he's broke. You're shitting me. No. He doesn't have anything at the bank either. Oh, Christ. That's why we needed a loan from your family. Hey, do you got a gun there? Yeah, I do. What kind is it? What do you mean, "what kind"? I like guns. The company here, they won't let me wear one. What kind is it? I don't know. It's deadly. It's a deadly gun. Look, will you just go away, huh? I gotta think. [YELPS] [STRAINED] Will you stop choking me? Jesus Christ! Ow! Stop swearing! [SCREAMING] No! No! No! [SCREAMING] [BOTH PANTING] Oh, Jesus. [GRUNTS] [GLASS SHATTERS] Shit. [WOMAN LAUGHING] [GROANS] Carmine. Bobby. Help me up. You look like shit. What is this, a Halloween party? No, I'm waiting for Charity to show up. De Carlo. What? Stole the money. You the one making all the commotion? Yeah. What are you, some kind of crazy kid, Carmine? Bobby, are you happy? What? Are you happy with your work? [SCOFFS] I don't know. Bobby, I'm serious. How do I know why a family makes the kind of decisions they make? No. I ain't all that happy with my given profession. But I definitely know I wouldn't be too happy if I was your brother. Now that, I know. Here we go now. I knew it was somewhere in the car. Sorry, it's just a madhouse out there. Oh, a gun. I like that. Stick around, Carmine. She takes Blue Cross. [CHUCKLES] Yeah, have fun, Bobby. Hey, Carmine. Carmine. Lexie. Lex. What are you doing? It's a long story. I'll explain later, okay? Sam! MAN: Whoa! [MAN GROANS] MAN: Nuts! Sorry. Need a lift? All right, don't anybody move. Do something. He's got a gun. If you need me, I'll be out in left field. What, now I have a full-blown alkie on my hands? Hey, just shut up and drive. Will you get that stuff out of here? What do you think you're doing? What do you think you're doing? You were on your way back up, for chrissakes. I'm the parent here, not you. I'm the parent. You could've fooled me. What I was doing tonight, I was doing for you. Look, don't do me any favors, alkie. Hey, if you weren't driving, I'd slap the piss out of you. I wasn't driving at the buffet table. I hate to ask you for the check now, Sam, but Max and I are leaving town in a hurry. Where's the money from the safe? There was no money in the safe. Harvey's broke. What do you mean? Broke, busted, tapped out, capiche? Any second now, Harvey or my brother is gonna come kick my ass, so can I have my check please? I don't have it. Excuse me? I don't have it. What do you want from me? You promised. And I don't have it. Every dime I have is in the spa. CARMINE: Oh, Jesus. Jesus! Jesus, Mary and Joseph! All right, stay here, live here rent-free. Harvey and my brother are not gonna just vanish in thin air. That's why I gotta get out of town. [THUNDER RUMBLES] [SCOFFS] [CHUCKLES] Do you know how bad you just fucked me? Huh? Hi. Hi. Remember how bad things were at the party? Well, it got worse. I trusted you. Your brother's an asshole. He's still my brother. Well, he's still an asshole. We needed the money. I didn't need the money that bad. It was my money. Forget it, Carmine, you cheated him. You have no excuse. I didn't cheat anybody. I'm not going, Carmine. I'm going to Florida with Steve. You're kidding me. Do I look like I'm kidding? Oh, man. What a jerk I am. This has got nothing to do with Harvey or Mr. Highway Patrol or me. You get too close to Steve, and hey, I'm your new pal. I say I'm ready to jump in, and then you're all packed and ready to move to the Sunshine State with Steve. It would have been tough, but we could've done it. It might even have been fun. Carmine, I'm 33 years old. I can't keep going someplace 'cause I think it'll be fun. I want a family, I want happiness. I love you, Lex. You don't have to move to find that. I love you too. So? So? So what are we gonna do about it? [VEHICLE APPROACHING] You better get out of here. [♪♪♪] Hey, Carmine, come here. Hey, wait a minute, I can explain. Hey. Hi, Frank. [GRUNTING] Sweet dreams. FRANK: You and Bobby deceive me? I don't know what you're talking about, I didn't deceive you. Come here. Oh, shit. Yo, Bobby. Did you and Carmine deceive me? Call me when you get out of the fucking hospital. Sorry, Bobby. That's twice. All right, Frank, you wanna discuss this? Discuss it. Hey, come on. Hey, Geno. Hey, Carmine. [GRUNTING] Windows. I can see it clearly now. This whole time I was thinking about how I was gonna get my life together. How it had something to do with fixing the past so I can get on with the future. You can't fix your past, nobody can. I can't fix what my brother's done to me, but what I can fix is him. Stupid Highway Patrol guy was right. Windows open. I'm gonna kill Frank. [♪♪♪] [WINCES] Mr. Brandstein? Mr. Brandstein? [LAUGHING] Oh! Newspaper. Newspaper. Newspaper! [YELPS] Newspaper! HARVEY: There's nothing out there but cactus and sand. This state is good for nothing but gambling. Congratulations. What do you want, an award? I'd kill both those douchebags if they weren't De Carlo's. There is no way I can come up with the money in 24 hours. We don't have Little Vegas to look forward to now. It's my dream, Sam. You're fucking with my dream. Harvey. You can extend my option or I can beat the shit out of you. I could or you could, but I'm not. Come on, come on. We're family, you and me. [LAUGHING] Hey. Hey, Grandma. Come on, you can't sit here, come on. Hey, Geno. What's the matter? What's the matter? Let me help you relax. [GRUNTS] Geno, bring me a coke, will you? Geno's napping. Carmine. Hello, Frank. That's cute. It's funny. You know what's funny? You can pick your job, you can pick your friends, but some nut upstairs just gives you a family. I don't get it. What you don't get is that I want more out of life than you do. I see something that I want, I get it. You stole my wife. Nobody put a gun to her head. You want her back? Fine. I can't do it anymore, Frank. I can't live with the idea that my past can just creep up behind me whenever the fuck it feels like it. [GUN COCKS] How do you do it, Frank? I can't do it. [GUN CLICKS] I can't be like you. What do you want, Carmine? Same thing I've always wanted, for you to love me. [SIGHS] I guess that's never gonna happen. So, uh... I forgive you, Frank. So you're gonna come back with me? No. No? No? I'll do it. Somebody's gonna have to shoot somebody. Since I can't seem to get out of my own way... then do it, Frank. Come on, do it. Shoot your little brother in the head. You could be just like me, Carmine. But you're a loser. I love you, Frank. [THUNDER RUMBLING] What's going on here, De Carlo? Counselor? You can't go in there. Come here, come here. Come clean, or it'll be a long ride to the emergency room. Wait, wait, wait, Carmine. Harvey hit Sam with his cast. What? He's in shock. The doc says he ain't gonna make it. Sam left you and Harvey's sister everything, the spa, the trailer park, the snake thing, the whole mishegoss. And since I'll be handling the estate, the easier you go on Harvey, the better it'll be for you. Are you trying to make a deal? I gotta look out for those clients of mine who are still among the living too, heh, you know. Can I get in there? Sure. Sam? Sam? Who's that? Is that Martha? Yes, it's Martha, Sam. Is Saul there? Saul's here, Sam. Forgive me for taking the money. We forgive you, Sam. [♪♪♪] Oh, man, these shoes are killing me. [CHUCKLES] You're growing like a weed. Is he dead? Yeah, he's dead. All this is ours? Yeah, you, me and her. Jesus, what a haul. Yeah, what a haul. What are we gonna do now? You and I are gonna live here the rest of our lives rent-free. She's going to Florida. MAX: What's in Florida? CARMINE: Happiness. We can be happy here. Yeah.
