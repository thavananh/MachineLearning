Just for now, while we're remodelling. 'We'? Who's 'we'? - Give me that. - Who's remodelling? You have a girlfriend? Why didn't you tell me? Can't she take you there? Doesn't she drive? She does. Know how it works? No. - It's automatic, you'll get used to it. - Hold on, Paulius. Are your parents home? Can I say hi? - My mom's sleeping. - And your father? Father doesn't live here anymore. Indre? Good evening. She's up. - She is. - Maybe she wasn't sleeping? - Mom, I've walked them already. - Okay. Evening. How are you? When did you come back? A couple of months ago. - We still have some of your things. - Mom, I've walked them already. I'll pick it up when I'm back. Thank you. - How long will you be here? - Just for the summer. Mom, we need to go now. I'm glad you keep in touch. Got a jacket? It says it'll rain tonight. Yes, I have. What were you doing then? I don't know, I was about to go out, maybe. What about you? I don't remember. Right turn somewhere here. There. Who are you texting? Who are you staying with at your mom's? - Hello. - Hi. - Good day. - Did I make you wait? No, we just arrived. Your keys. Here you are. Please. Oh, sorry. Hey, little fatty. Can you wait here? I'll be right back. Sit. - You're leaving him like that? - What? - Your baby. - Sure. Aren't you afraid? Who's gonna take him here? Paulius, it's raining! He landed around this time. It was the last plane. The passengers got on the bus down there. Matas crossed that parking lot, walked along this sidewalk, passed here - looking for a shop. Went that way to get some cigarettes. It's raining, come on. Step aside. Come on. Right here... This is where Vytenis' car was. It was facing that way with the trunk here. Hello. Hi, I'll clean it in a sec, have a seat. No no, can we speak to Ieva? - Who? - Ieva. She was a waitress here. - When was that? - At least four years ago. - How many years? - Four. I don't know her. Come back tomorrow and talk to the owner. Thank you. Matas went up these stairs. And over to the bar. Ieva sold him a pack of cigarettes. Then he came back and... Here. Vytenis sat right here. He and Matas got into an argument. Matas went up those stairs and walked off that way. Vytenis followed him. Matas didn't hear or see him. Then he hit him over the head and stuffed him into his trunk. All right here. Behind that fence. He was put into the trunk as everybody sat here, eating, drinking. And no one saw or heard a thing! Paulius... Hold this. Right there. Are you stupid? He got out through here. Give me that. And then he crawled this way. Paulius, your slipper. Thanks. This was it. He reached this fence and couldn't get over it. His arms were all bruised, fingernails cracked. He tried to get over the fence but his leg was broken. Here they found pieces of his skin. And no one saw him? No. Seriously? Someone came forward later on. They noticed something while driving by, but they thought it was a dog. He lay here for two hours. Vytenis saw the cellar empty, then found him here and dragged him back. - Can you believe it? - What? This fence is 91 cm tall. So nobody noticed him? What are you doing here? Nothing, why? Where's your girl? I'm alone. Maybe you need a ride then? I'm fine, thanks. Indre. - Wanna sit here for a bit? - No, I'm off to bed. I left the car on the bridge. Dragged him here. It was dark, I stumbled, nearly fell into the water myself. Kicked him in the ribs. He cried, gasping for air. I kicked him again. Then I dragged him under the bridge. Hit my head on this concrete edge. Then I sat him. Grabbed his throat like this. I slapped on the back of his head, slapped his face. I said, "Open your mouth, you're gonna blow me." It's near the dam. We'll go there. You watch it a lot? No. Get some sleep, Paulius. Paulius? Are you OK? Good morning. We're here about the house. Saw the ad online. My grandson is selling it. We must've talked to him. His name's Jurgis, isn't it? I guess we're a bit early. Didn't he tell you we were coming? Yeah, we must've come at a wrong time. But we came all the way from Vilnius. Can we have a look around since we're here? Sure. Thank you so much. This used to be my husband's workshop. He was a woodworker. He made all these church-like windows. It's all solid wood, oak. Everything is handmade. Unfortunately, he couldn't finish it. This is the living room. My husband and I were supposed to live on this floor. The upstairs was meant for my late daughter and her husband and kids. Be careful, there's no railing. We were going to use the attic as a children's room. Since my both grandchildren are boys, we wanted to put the beds like this. - Where do your grandkids live now? - Jurgis lives not too far away. And the other one? Where's the other one? Those are our... two greenhouses. We used to grow roses in them when my husband was alive. Now they're really run down, but... - You can fix them if you want. - Can we look at the cellar? - What cellar? - That one, with the window. Oh, but there's nothing in it. We don't keep anything there. Still, we'd like to see it since we're thinking of buying the place. I'm afraid it could be flooded. Thank you. I'm not going in. It's hard for me to get out because of my back. We'll manage. They have a pool. It's here. - Your house? - They said they are going to buy it. They came from Vilnius. Why did you let them inside there? They wanted to look around everything. Cellars, greenhouses. Why go to the cellar? Well, you go first. I don't know, look around. Hey. Grandma, this is his brother. Don't you remember? I've forgotten. Your memory is shit. Don't worry, we're leaving. Goodbye, sorry. What about your memory? - Making a fool of an old person... - Shut up, dunce. You should be ashamed, coming here and fooling me. Can you even imagine what we've been through? And my grandson... You're an animal! I'll come back tonight and kill both of you. - Jesus Christ... - Fucking morons. He is an imbecile. Did you see that? - Good day. - Hi. Can we speak to the owner? - No, you can't. - Why not? He wanted me to tell you to fuck off and stop asking about shit. Ieva stopped working here ages ago. Why? And quit walking around like morons if you're not buying anything. - Why? - Why what? Want me to call security? - You have security here? - For you, yes. A beer and a pack of blue Camels, please. Sure, but we have to open the can. You can just tap it. After. Wait. I really need to talk to the owner. - Please. - Let go of my arm. As you can see, we're almost done. - It's not perfect yet... - They're the ones looking for Ieva. Hello. We want to talk to you about Ieva. She used to work here, didn't she? She no longer does. Yes but do you know where she is? I let her go. I understand, but do you know where we can find her? What for? Look, I cooperated with the police, provided the CCTV footage. That's it. Great, well done. Of course it is! If I had done it immediately none of the rest would've happened! I would've smashed that faggot. But you didn't. Because I was away. I wasn't here. Put it here. Did you come here to make fun of me? No, I just want to talk to Ieva. She won't tell you anything. You won't talk to her. It's over. That's it. Vytenis was sentenced. Case was closed. I gave a statement, testified. I gave them all the footage. I would've beaten that faggot. You already said about the faggot. I just want to talk to Ieva. She's the last person to see my brother alive. No. Are you going to drink and drive? Are you going to buy them a new mirror? - What mirror? - The one you broke. Let's go apologise. - No. - You'll call them? Paulius, you know you can't threaten to kill people. They may believe it. - What can I say then? - Nothing. Unless you really want to murder the old lady. - Do you? - Excuse me. Could you spare a cigarette? - Your friend smokes too? - Yeah, thanks. Give me a lighter. Do you or don't you want to kill the old lady? No. Maybe that one lady. I just want revenge. I want to avenge my brother's death. Isn't that normal? I'm not sure it's normal. Don't you want to hurt all of these people? - They did nothing wrong to us. - They raised Vytenis. Here you go. - Your car? - No, his mother's. Why are you silent? Got scared of a hobo? - We are not hobos. - Whatever. - What did you say? - Fuck off. - Give me my lighter. - No. - Give it back. - No. Open the car. - Give me my lighter. - Don't touch me. - It's my lighter. - Get your dirty hands off. I'm sorry. You are serious, I get that. What are you doing, Paulius? Go, go, go. Back to work. Is that your sack of cement there? Clean it up, will you? I'm sorry, I didn't know he was armed. Let's go, Paulius. You're embarrassing me in front of all these men. Moron. - Paulius? - Yes. - Hi - Hello. - Is this the one? - Yep. Can I have the key? What's he doing there? I don't know. - Close it. - Are you retarded? Come on, close it. Let me out! Let me out! Are you buying it? Yes. - Where are you going? - To the bathroom. I'll get the papers ready. The mattress goes in the same room. Oh. Hold the mayo for me. We call him that because he's fat. Aren't you? So you didn't buy the house? My mother's friends with Nijole. Hang on, mommy's smoking. What are you up to now? Paulius is buying a car. - That one? - Yes. Disturbing. Been to see Ieva yet? What? To get some furniture for your house. She works at the furniture store now. - Which one? - Round the corner, on the main street. OK, I'm coming. - Hi, Karolina. - Hi! Hi, little Juozas! Come come. - Your Paulius is handsome. - What? - I mean, he's cute. - Are you serious? Don't you think so? I think he's an idiot, but I know him since 3rd grade. Those are the cutest ones. He had it parked something like this. There were lots of cars here and here, and on the street. Tons of people. Kids were coming from school. A lot of witnesses saw this car. Matas was in the trunk. Tied up, gagged. Vytenis sat on the hood and watched the game. He didn't want to leave him in that cellar. Was worried grandma might discover him. After the game, he planned to drive to the dam and drown him there. As if it was an accident. - Then he put him in a dress, lipstick. - What? Paulius, there's nothing here. It's empty, quiet. It's a village. Are you still upset about the mirror? No, it's cool. Why did you bring a gun? It was just left in the car. I wasn't going to shoot anyone. Look at me. How could I shoot anyone? I talked to that hotel owner. She told me where Ieva works now. And she also said you were cute. Would you want something with her? - She has a baby. - So? Good day. Are you Ieva? We've been looking for you. We'd like to talk. About what? Matas' kidnapping. Yes? - Can you tell us more? - I told everything in court. Did you really? I'm sorry, I really have nothing else to say. Go on, tell us... how you didn't realise Matas was being kidnapped. Tell us why you didn't call the police. I'm really sorry. I'll burn you with acid. He's joking. You're joking, yes? No. Sorry. I'm sorry, I was joking. It's all my fault. It's fine, it was nothing. Mr Paulius? You're Paulius, aren't you? Come closer! Come, come. - I don't have my passport. Call Juste. - Who? Juste. The one you're staying at your mom's with? Call my mom, she'll know everything. - I'm being arrested. - For what? For the mirror. Good luck then. Indre? - You must be Juste. - That's right. So, this is his passport. I also brought his shoes. Don't know why, I just brought them. Does he need anything else? Is this his? Yes. - Maybe you want to go to the precinct? - No no, I've got to go. Bring him home by Sunday. He has to be back at work next week. Okay. Wait. Take care. Bye. Is something wrong? I'm here for Paulius. He was brought in a couple of hours ago. Laima? Come with me. Everyone here knew Vytenis was unstable. A troubled kid. After his mother passed away, he grew up with his grandma. Frankly, the three of them with his brother were doing pretty well. But later his brother went abroad to work. Vytenis was left alone with grandma, who couldn't deal with him. And what happened, happened. Nothing can be done about it now. No one could have even imagined that Vytenis would ever do such a thing. Here's his passport. Can I see him? We arrested Vytenis as soon as we found Matas' body. That's great... Everyone who saw it, testified, everyone co-operated. Vytenis was sentenced to life. There is no one else to blame, no one else to take revenge on. I understand. Can I see Paulius? You should go now, it's late. We'll keep Paulius overnight. - On what grounds? - Identification. Please, let him go today. Relax. Paulius will love it here. We'll put him in the same cell Vytenis was in. - Are you serious? - Yes. I swear I didn't realise he was being kidnapped. They just had a row at the bar. I didn't think it was serious. And I really didn't see what happened outside. I thought they knew each other and were fooling around. Vytenis was into stupid shit like that. What was the row about? Well, Vytenis jumped the queue and then... The other guy didn't want to back off so he said something. That's why it didn't look serious. They were both aggressive. Is that it? Yeah. I mean, I served Vytenis first. Just 'cause he's Jurgis' brother and I knew him, so... I just wanted him to leave. - Is that what you testified in court? - Yeah. Vytenis confirmed it. Then he said he got upset... - Let's go? - I'll drive her. - You go alone, will you? - Sure. Then he waited for... Matas, was he? - Yes, Matas. - Matas. He waited for him outside. Hit him on the head, dragged him into his car. I really don't know what came over him. Did you know him? Yeah. We were friends from primary school. I used to hang out with them all the time. We were like brother and sister. - Except we were fucking. - What? We were together, like a couple. He even proposed to me secretly. But then we decided to wait until we graduated. He proposed at such a young age? Wow, that's sweet. After he died I had a termination done. Damn. Shit. Does Jurgis still keep in touch with his brother? - You mean, Vytenis? - Yes. Vytenis is dead. Come on, let's go. - No, I've got to go. - It's just a couple of friends. Come on. I better not. Good evening. - Hey! Hi. - Hi. I apologise for Paulius once again. I'm leaving. Can you give Martynas a ride? Who? Martynas, the guy who sold you the Audi. No, I really have to go. OK, stay here. You'll drive him home. I have to go. - Will you be here tomorrow? - We were going to. Paulius wants to drive to the dam. Write down my number. If you're still here tomorrow, come to the school. There's a school event tomorrow. I'll introduce you to a girl. She saw Matas after me. You should talk to her. - She didn't appear in court. - Why not? She was underage. No one wanted to get her involved. Hey. Left turn right here. Why did you buy that car? His brother was driven around in the trunk of that car. How do you all know each other? We're from the same school. How many schools are there in Karmelava? One. Why did you come? To visit. What? Take a left. Places related to Matas' murder. Why? What do you mean why? He was killed here. Left turn there. And immediately right, before the bus stop. Straight ahead now. Here. My classmate was murdered here. They raped and killed her. I used to go to school through here. Down there used be a house. A husband killed his wife and son, then set the house on fire and shot himself. Did he rape his son too? What? You find it funny? What's your problem? What's your problem? Why are you telling me all this filth? There's a mass grave in the forest behind the airport. - Since the war. - The war? - Yes, the war. - What war? Fuck. Russians, Germans, freedom fighters. Remember? So, what's your point? I don't know. We live here. That way. How are you? Good. What happened to him? Cellmates strangled him. So this is the mother. Grandfather. And him. - Hey. - Hi. This is Milda. - Hi, Milda. - Hello. Why don't I go with Indre first? She wasn't sure she wanted to talk to you. You can wait for us with Jurgis. Shall we? I go out at 3AM, dying for a cigarette. No one around had any left. My last chance was these two big dudes. I come up to them and I go, 'Guys, do you know 'the story about two dickheads who had no cigarettes?' They look at each other, 'No.' I say, 'Gimme a cigarette and I'll tell you.' They go, 'We don't have any.' I'm like, 'Well, then think about it.' And I ran home, almost sprinting, feeling their stares burning the back of my head. Only on a Friday... Tell it to Jurgis. Anyway. Friday, club, the usual. I step out at 3AM, dying for a cigarette. And no one around has any. My last hope is these two big dudes. I tell them, 'Do you know the story of two dickheads who had no cigarettes?' They look at each other, 'No.' I say, 'Gimme a cigarette and I'll tell it.' They say, 'we don't have any.' I'm like, 'Well, then think about it.' And I almost ran away. If I had made eye contact, I might have spent the night in the trunk of a car. What club was that? There is just one... Why did you threaten Ieva? What? Why did you harass her? She didn't call the cops. Couldn't you talk to her properly? They asked her properly in court. She didn't say anything. Are you stupid? Where are you going? On the second night Vytenis brought him to her party in the suburbs. He pulled him out of the trunk to show off. Matas had pissed himself, crying. Calling out your name. Repeating your phone number. Asking someone to call you. Vytenis then put him back in the trunk and left. Let's go? What's the matter, Paulius? Did you get scared we'd beat you ? In broad daylight, behind the school? He thought we were going to beat him up and ran away. - Fuck off, ok? - You were there, weren't you? At that party. Where is that house? - What's her name? - Migle. - New owners live there, it's changed. - I don't care! I want to see it. Get in. We're going there. He got out and said, 'I've got a surprise for you.' He pulled your brother out of the trunk. We were stunned. Vytenis took Matas further down there. There was a table, a tent, I don't know if it is still there. Showed him to Migle. A lot of people were blacked out, sleeping. Migle started crying, I told him to drive back and let him go. Vytenis smashed a window. Put Matas back in the trunk and left. We were drunk and had no clue what was going on. Where are you going? - Which window? - Come back, new people live there. I said, which window? A small one, on the other side. Is he okay? No. But you could've done something. - What? - You could've stopped him that night. How? We were all wasted. We struggled not to vomit on our shoes. It didn't seem so... tragic. It happened so fast, You couldn't understand what was going on. Those were different times. Four years ago? - Could've called the cops. - They would have arrested us, as well. Then just stop him from leaving. We could have. Could've brought him home, wash him, and tend to his wounds. Vytenis could've not kicked him, not put him in the trunk. He could've not rape him, not kill him. He himself could have kept quiet. But if you had known it would end this way. Would you have helped him? I would. Juste took it. Paulius... Why didn't you meet him at the airport? What did you talk about with Martynas? You like him, don't you? Fuck off. Drive past Užusaliai, you'll see a dam. There's a bridge somewhere here. Okay. Thanks. Here? Here. Get up, Indre. Come on, let's get out of here. Please. Get up. Please, let's just go. Why didn't you tell me about the baby? Are you ashamed? It's a nice thing. - Didn't want to upset you. - Why? Matas told me you were pregnant. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, mom. These are wet clothes. - Okay. - I'll get your things. - No need. - Just a sec, I'll bring them. - Just throw them out. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. I don't need them. Well... I'd better go. See you. Wait, Indre. Where are you going? It's raining. It's not much. It's fine. - See you. - Bye.
