I'll just go and phone the nearest garage, that's all. Well look, if you need money for the tow or something. I have Triple A. Hey, wait up. I don't see any telephone wires. Over there. Those are power lines. Don't you know the difference? I thought guys were supposed to be so mechanically minded. Zack! Leroy! You all right? Yeah, I'm fine! Jesus. I thought you bought it back there. I know. I don't know what's going on. Now listen, listen to me. Do you know anything about going on? - You look like hell, boy. - I know, I know. I don't know what's going on. Now look, Sally Mae here drove me up here and-- Excuse me. Would you listen to me? Sally Mae gave me a ride here and we almost got murdered by half a dozen guys on the way here. What are you talking about? Because she's got bullet holes in her car and everything. Somebody's been shooting at you? Yeah, I don't know why. Now look, do you know anything about what's been going on around here, anything at all? Because I gotta know because something's going on here and I don't know what it is. You said it wasn't my foot locker. If it's not that, I don't know what it is. I don't know. Maybe it is the foot locker. I don't know. - I didn't tell nobody. What about you? - Excuse me. I didn't say nothing. Listen, I've got to get to a phone, please. I gotta call triple A, OK? Her car's stuck on the end of your driveway. We ain't got no phone. Nearest one's down the road about five miles. Shit. Now hold on. Here's my folks. Uh, Pa-- What's that piece of junk down on the road.

Give me back that key. What did you do that for? I want it quiet. I want to listen if anybody's following. How far can we go in this boat? Why don't you ask me where? I can't go home, not after what you did to the still. Oh, would you shut up about that still. What about my car? It took me two years to save my allowance to buy that beautiful piece of machine. Listen, lunch meat, I don't give a-- Chuck it, chuck it, both of yous. It's not going to help anything. Listen, first off, we've got to have some kind of map. A map ain't worth shit. Look, it all looks the same out here at night. Where's the next dry land? - 20 miles. - Forget it. The way these things eat gas, we're going to be stuck in the middle of nowhere. Listen, if somebody's got a better idea, I'll be glad to live up to it. [screaming] Don't scare it! Ah! Hey! [screaming] I got it. I got it. I got it. [screams] Shoot it! Shoot it! Put the gun down, Beecher. [gunshot] Get it! Kill it! It's a bastard. Oh, God. Oh! Get it out of here. Don't put that thing in here, man! Come on. Sorry I had to do that to you, but you could have done some real damage with that gun. - Thanks. I just go all funny whenever I see one of those. Oh, damn it's cold. Kid, we're not going to stay here, are we? I don't think we have much choice. Maybe tomorrow we can sneak back to the Beechers and see if everything's-- I ain't going home. You don't know my pa. We'd better keep a look out. I'll take the first watch, Leroy, and wake you up after midnight. Better get some sleep, too, Sally Mae. I'm not tired.
