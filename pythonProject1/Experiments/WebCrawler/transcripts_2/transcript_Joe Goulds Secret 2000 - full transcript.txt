In New York... in New York City... in Greenwich Village... down among the cranks... and the misfits... and the one lungers... and the has-beens... and the might-have-beens... and the would-bes... and the never-wills... and the God-knows-whats... I have always felt at home." Joe Gould told me that when I was first writing about him, not knowing that I felt the same. As time went on, I would learn that this was not the only thing we had in common. [radio announcer] Good morning, everyone, this is Dan Lomax with another P.A.L. show. What are you doing today? -Dad... -Joe? -Uh, pardon? -What are you doing today? Oh, well, I'll be in the office. I'm--I'm finishing up that, uh, story I was writing, -the story about that fellow. -The same one? No, a different one-- Which one do you mean, hon? -I don't know. -[Nora] The one you were working on. He works on a lot of them, Nora. -Yes, so whi-- -I know, Mama. I was just asking. The Fish Man? Ah, yes, the Fish Man? Oh, Mr. Flood? No, not old Mr. Flood. No, I-I finished with Mr. Flood. [chuckles] I finished with him. I liked him. He wasn't real though, Elizabeth. I know. I mean, I just liked his story, him. Well, thank you very much. I liked him, too. But, no, you're right, Nora, he was not real. He was all--all different people kinda all balled up into one. You know? Did those people know? [Mitchell] What? That they were made into someone else? Uh... no, I don't think so. So what is this story you're doing? Well, this story's about... a fella who has a bar. Well, i-it's about the bar. -A bar? -A bar? Yes, a bar. An old bar, the oldest bar in New York City. Sounds boring. Well... I don't mean boring, I just mean, a bar? Oh, my goodness. Girls, we're late. Come on. Get your things quickly, quickly. All right, let's go. What time is it? Joe, do you not have your watch on? No, I have it. I have it. -Okay, that's enough. -All right, let's go. Hurry up. Hurry up. Elizabeth, get your hat. Please. -Therese. -Hmm? Do you think it's boring? Well, I don't know. I haven't read it. It could be boring. It depends on what happens. Well, you know, nothing happens. Well, then it all depends on the writer, doesn't it, my dear? -[Nora] Come on! -All right, all right. Let's go. Here we go. Does Elizabeth have her bag? Good girl. Yes, you are. -Okay. Come here. Come here. -Good-bye, Mom. -Bye, sweetheart. -Bye, Mom. [jazz music playing] [Sarah] Good morning, Mr. Mitchell. Morning, Sarah. Well, you forgot the "good." Pardon? You said only, "Morning," without the "good." Well, I haven't quite made up my mind about this one yet. [both chuckle] [phone rings] New Yorker. -[woman] Morning, Mr. Mitchell. -Morning. [Harold] Mitchell. Mr. Ross. -I love it! -What? This. The bar piece. Oh, oh, well, thank you, but... -it's not done yet. -Well, it feels done to me. [chuckles] Well, thanks, but, um... uh, I was thinking that, um-- Well, I was thinking that it could be... What, longer? No. Maybe. But, uh, no, I don't think so. I think it, um-- Well, I think it could-- [stammers] I think I could, um... Thank God you don't write like you talk. -[laughs] -Mr. Ross, the meeting's... No, uh, honestly, I was thinking that, um... it cou-- um, it could-- it just could have more. What more? -What? -More what? Weight. -Joe, I-- -No, I know, I know, but-- but-- I really think that I could, um, -I could-- -You could, and you could, you could. You could always could. True, true. [laughs] [Harry] It's snowing upstate. -[Mitchell] Aren't you a skier, Harry? -[Harry] Ski? Are you--are you-- are you a skater? A skater, no. No. I thought you were the, um, The Hans Christian Ander-- Now, what's his name? Who's that fella? -Who's that? -The skater. Brinker. Sonja Henie. [laughs] Well, you do-- you resemble her, just-- -Brinker. -I-I know. Bri-- Hans Brinker. Yes. Now I know. Yes. -I look like Hans Brinker? -Huh? I look like Hans Brinker? You guys. Let me get something to eat, Harry. I can't wait till tonight. [Harry] Get me a bowl of soup, Jimmy! Jesus Christ. [muttering] [mumbles] Soup's up! How do, Joe? Could be worse. Could be worse. No more comin' in during the day, Joe. You hear me? Joe? Of course I heard you, Harry. You're standing only inches from me. Please don't think me stupid just because I'm unclean. That would be judging a book by its cover, and you're far too sophisticated a fellow for that kind of simple thinking. ♪ Ha-Ha-Harry ♪ ♪ Hee hee hee hee hee ♪ [chuckles] Ah, Harry! [slurps] See you on the stroke of 12:00, Harry. [coughs] Who the hell was that? A pain in my ass. Why do you feed him? He's a human being, Mike. What can I do? He's a freak. What can I say? We're all freaks, Mike. The truth be known, we're all freaks together. [Gould] Oh, excuse me, sir. I was wondering if I might trouble you for a light. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, could I-- a little contribution to the Joe Gould Fund? No, please, just a little money. Just a little money... -No. -[squawks] [soft music playing] [Mitchell] Nora, would you fetch that newspaper in there, on the sofa? All right, Elizabeth, come on. [Elizabeth] What? [Mitchell and Therese] It's watermelon! Oh, good! Come on. There we go. -Thank you. -Hold on. Hold on. I pick... - There we go. - I pick... this one. -Oh! -Okay. My daddy always said this was the only thing a newspaper was good for. And what did you say? Me? I said not a thing. -Mmm. -That's good. Mmm! Oh, no. Oh, no. I won't do that. I'll give you a dance. Now, I can do a seagull, a seagull. [squawks] Thank you. Thank you. -[Mitchell] Harry? -Yes? -Let me ask you a question. -[Harry] Mm-hmm? You know what fella who was in here the other day? Who? The small, disheveled looking-- -That was you, Joe. -Oh, hush. No, you know who I'm talking about-- Gould. I know who you mean. Joe Gould, the writer. "The writer"? Yep, written the History of the World. Now don't say I never gave you anything. What do you mean, "the History of the World"? [stammers] I'm tellin ya-- Not like a history book, like, history. But more like what people say to each other on the street, wherever, every day in their lives, you know? In a-an oral history, he says he calls it. Help me out, Jimmy. You know, oral. From the mouth. Go talk to Max Gordon at the Village Vanguard and... Oh, okay. All right. [Mitchell] So you say Mr. Gould comes in here and leaves these notebooks? -Hundreds of notebooks. -Uh-huh. Dozens, Max. Dozens. All right, dozens of these notebooks. They're composition books, like, you know, from school. Yeah, he drops them off for safekeeping. He doesn't have a home, you know. No, I know, I know. He leaves them here, and then he leaves. -We give him some money. -Yeah. Always, for the Joe Gould Fund. -That's what he calls it. -Really? I feel badly for him. Sadie, it's a choice. Who makes a choice like that? He did. He does. What are you gonna do? People live their lives the way they wanna live their lives. -True, true. -Give them some money, -food, you know, a lot of us do. -Mm-hmm. Aaron Siskind. Cummings. -E.E. Cummings? -Yeah. -Alice, Alice Neel. -Alice. Yeah, we all do. He's a smart man, Gould. -He's very smart. -He's just... Who knows? [Mitchell] So, Miss Neel, when did you paint this portrait of him? This was, uh... let us say, 17 years ago. Uh... yeah. When we were all-- Hmm. [record playing song in French] Wow. That's very nice. [Alice] Hmm. I gave him three penises. Yes, I see that. Didn't really seem to be enough. -Really? -Well, because I think Joe's an exhibitionist. I mean, not technically, but... Uh-huh. When I'd be watching him at parties, you know, way back, uh, I'd think... he's a little old exhibitionist shut off in there somewhere. He really likes this-- this portrait a lot. Well, I don't blame him. -It's a very... -Yeah. Well, at least I'll never be accused of being a romantic. Oh, no, no, no. There's no fear of that. I like it very much. I really do. [Mitchell] I'm looking for a fella by the name of Joe Gould. [laughs] Professor Seagull, huh? -Gould? -Yeah, Gould. -Joe Gould, right? -Joe Gould, yes. That's right. Yeah, he-- he speaks seagull, you know, or understands it or both or something. -Really? -Yeah. -Well, Max Gordon, you know, uh, Max Gordon fella. -Vanguard. Vanguard, yeah. Uh, he told me that I might find him here. Oh, yeah. He's right behind you. That's him. He comes in here all the time. We give him food. He sits. He writes. -It's good for business. -Uh-huh. The tourists see a real bohemian, they go, "Ooh." [both chuckle] Comes in about 7:00. [Mitchell] I see. Thank you. Hello. Yes, uh, this is Joe Mitchell. I won't be able to make it back to the office this afternoon. Are there any messages for me? [Sarah] Mr. Mitchell, it's Sarah. There's a gentleman here who wishes to speak with you. I don't have an appointment for anyone. He's very insistent. He hasn't given me his name. -I don't know how you'd like for me to handle this-- -Give me the phone! Excuse me! Hello! This is Joe Gould, author of the Oral History. Oh, yes. H-hello, Mr. Gould. Uh-- [Gould] The thing is, I was supposed to attend a clinic. The eye and ear infirmary for the-- I can pick a prescription for a little... Uh, excuse me, madam! I'm talking to your boss. Uh, a little eye infection I've been having. Uh, and it's gonna cost me around $2.00. And I just discovered that I don't have any money on me. Uh, it's getting late and I just wondered if your-- -your lady here, your secretary could-- -Sir! Sir! Excuse me. I haven't finished talking to Mr. Mitchell! If your receptionist here, could lend me $2.00, and we could meet anytime you say and I'll pay you back. How about the... [coughs] The Jefferson Coffee Shop! 9:30! [grunts] Hello? Hello? He's a terribly dirty little man, terribly nosy. I was glad to get him out of here. Well, Sarah, I am terribly sorry for your inconvenience. Oh, it's just, you know. For one thing, he wanted to know how much I make. -He did? -Oh! He said he'd also thought about it, and that 9:30 in the morning was a little early for him. Suggested you meet him at a more civilized hour, such as 11:00. 11 a.m.? Okay. Well, that's okay. I could do that. He also told me that... I have beautiful shoulders. Well, he's right. -[both laugh] -Stop! Good night, Sarah. And thanks again. So I suppose you're puzzled about me, Mr. Mitchell. If so, the feeling's mutual. I'm puzzled about me, and have been since childhood. [chuckles] Did you ever have a painful operation or disease? Uh, I beg your pardon? Say, "I may marry Mary." Um, "I may marry Mary." How did your father feel when you didn't want to go into the tobacco business? Well, um... -Tell you the truth, he was disappointed. -Ah. How did you know I was from Fairmont? Well, at first, I thought Kentucky... then Tennessee. But your As are too broad... so North Carolina. -Tidal North Carolina. -That's very good. -[chuckles] -No, no, it's okay. Because my father was very disappointed in me, too. [rubs hands] So you want to know about the oral history. Yes, I do. Yes, uh, first things first, Mr. Mitchell. First things. Uh, my full name is Joseph Ferdinand Gould. My father, Clarke Storer Gould, was a doctor, as was his father before him, as was, as was... And the Goulds have been the Goulds since the Cabots and the Lowells were clam-diggers. Uh, should've been born in Boston, but was born and raised in Norwood, which is a fairly good-sized Yankee town about 15 miles southwest of the city. Went to Harvard. -Ah. -Graduated class 1911. Then after Harvard, I-I did a variety of unsuitable things. I studied eugenics, which I put to use by measuring the heads of a thousand Chippewa Indians. Let's face it. The only civilized people left. Before finally arriving in New York where I became a half messenger boy, uh, half police reporter on the Evening Mail. Evening Mail, yeah, sure. I know the Evening Mail. [Gould] Now this is very important. One day, while I was reading during the lunch hour, I saw a quote which changed the course of my life forever. No, I'll--I'll tell it to you at a later time. -All right. -Then all of a sudden, the idea for the Oral History occurred to me. I would spend my life in the city... listening to people and writing down whatever I heard them say, no matter how boring or dull or idiotic or... Where the hell is our lunch?! Goddamn Greek son of a bitch. You know how long the Oral History is now, Mr. Mitchell? No, I don't. Um, but, um... [Gould] One million... two-hundred thousand words long. That's three times longer than the Holy Bible. That's very impressive. I think so. I think so. I mean, not even given-- [Mitchell] Uh, no, no, I know. Thanks. Thank you. [waitress] You oughta have more self-respect than to do a thing like that. When I'm hungry, I don't have any self-respect. Besides... I-I'm not just an ordinary person! I am Joe Gould! I'm Joe Gould the poet! I'm Joe Gould the historian! I'm Joe Gould the wild Chippewa Indian dancer! I do you an honor merely coming into this place! And what do you do in return but bother me about such things as ketchup! [chuckles] There is a small word for a big woman like that but I'll not use it until we're better acquainted. Let's eat. -[grunts] -Oh, so, what did you-- -Oh. Ah. -I got-- Yeah, it's an excerpt from Ezra Pound's old magazine. -August, 1927. -Oh, The Exile. Oh, yes. I know this. -There's a chapter from the Oral History in there. -Certainly. And, uh, I've got E.E. Cummings to thank for that. Oh, you know E.E.? He knows me-hee-hee. [both chuckle] -Yeah, he wrote a poem about me. -Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now here's-- What the fuck? Oh, cigarette butts. No, no, that's okay. It's useful to have a sack when the weather's wet. -Sure. -Now we got-- [coughs] Yeah, we've got a copy of Broom here. Oh, good, all right. Yes, I know Broom. Now, that has snippets of the Oral History in there. Yeah. Good. -All right. Wonderful. -Yeah. -One more snippet-- Whoa! -And, uh... Whoa-ho-ho! -I have it. I have it. -You got it? Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. Now we've got Pagany. Pagany. Now there's some snippets in there. Oh, yes. I know Pagany. -There's a quote, a copy of a quote. - This one? -Ezra-- -That's right, that Ezra Pound wrote about me and William Carlos Williams. -Oh, really? -Yeah. Oh, well, all right. -Well... -I hope it doesn't rain. No, I hope not. -Well, that's good. -Anyway, so yes, -this is good for now. This is good for now. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Perfect. So, uh, Mr. Gould, when-- when should we meet again? Ah. Saturday? -Saturday? -Yeah. At Goody's. -That's a bar. -Yes, I know. On-- on Sixth and Ninth. -Yes, I know. -Between Ninth and Tenth. -Yes, I know. -You know all the best bars, don't you, Mr. Mitchell? -[chuckles] Well... -I think we're going to get along quite well. [laughs] -[Gould] Bye! -Bye-bye! [Mitchell] "I have not read anything else by Joe Gould. And yet, by this alone, he is one of the great and genuine and original American writers. 'I'll put down the informal history of the shirt-sleeved multitude, what they had to say about their jobs, love affairs, victuals, sprees, scrapes, and sorrows. The Oral History is a great hodgepodge and kitchen midden of hearsay, a repository of jabber, an omnium-gatherum of bushwa... gab, palaver, hogwash, flapdoodle, and malarkey, the fruit of more than 20,000 conversations. What people say is history,' Gould says, 'what we used to think was history, is only formal history and largely false. I'll put down the informal history, or I'll perish in the attempt.'" [Mitchell] Maybe he was afraid. Maybe. I mean, did you sneak up on him? Joe! No, well, I'm just saying, I mean, it could've felt like that to him. I was practically invisible. No, honey, you're too attractive to be invisible. -Oh, well, thank you very much. -That's okay. No, he jumped up and berated me. "How dare you?! I don't know you!" I was terribly embarrassed. Well, some people feel it steals your soul. Now, why would I want his soul? Where would I put it? You're a pretty funny young lady, aren't you? Sometimes. [Gould] Is she your type? [Mitchell] Parts of her. I like her entirety. I love her, in fact. But... I know her, of course. -How do you mean? -Oh, I don't mean in the biblical sense. Although, I swear it got very close one time between me and her on one rainy afternoon. There was a tension aroused so palpable, you could've... tripped on it. No, no. I meant that, uh... I know her, because... Gaston Lachaise, the sculptor... is a friend and supporter of mine. [Mitchell] Oh, really? You don't believe me? No, that's not-- Uh, yes, I mean, that's not what I meant by it. Well, what did "really" mean? No, it just meant, "really." An expression of shock. No, not at all, Mr. Gould. It was an expression that... I was impressed. Really? Yes. So anyway, you're saying that this fella Lachaise... Yes, Lachaise. Lachaise. -Is a supporter of yours? -He is a supporter of mine. and he took up cudgels on my behalf in a soiree one evening, when Edward Nagle called me a barbarian. Because I didn't see a picture as a picture, it didn't mean anything to me. All I saw was the expression of the man who had painted it. And Gaston Lachaise agreed with me, saying that art is essentially a means of self-expression, putting E. Nagle in his place. [both chuckle] Well, that must have made you feel good. No, actually it made me feel bad. Because although our thoughts were the same, Gaston's and mine, his meant something because he was who he was. Mine meant nothing, because I was who I am. I see. You know, Mr. Gould, if you publish the Oral History, you might become someone who people know. Oh, is that what it's all about? Well, no, no, I'm just saying that, if you wanted that. I'm not saying that that's what it's ab-- That's-- that's my hat. -Um... -Mr. Mitchell, I have lugged the Oral History into 14 different publishing offices, and none would have it. So you have done that? Well, yes, I have done that, and none of them would have it. Mr. Gould, when might I see some of the Oral History? Why, I... thought you'd never ask, Mr. Mitchell. Vivian! We're going! Okay. Bye-bye. -It was so nice to meet you. -It was nice to meet you, too. -[mumbles] -Oh, yes. She's just, uh... Thanks. Thanks. That'll come in handy. -Great show. Congrats. -Oh, thank you. Bye-bye, Joe and Joe. [chuckles] [Gould] I keep chapters of the Oral History stored with friends and colleagues around town. These are mostly artists who understand the importance of what I'm doing and who are also regular contributors to the Joe Gould Fund. Helen? Helen, it's Joe Gould. I need to pick up a few volumes of the O.H. -Sweetheart. -[Helen] Oh, hi, Joe. -I need to pick up a few volumes of the O.H. -Oh, sure. I have need of them now. At least... Mr. Mitchell, my biographer, does. -[Helen] Who? -Mr. Mitchell! My biographer. He's with me now. He writes for The New Yorker. [clatter] -[clatter, cat meowing] -[Helen] Oh! Here. Here. -Those are-- -Two, right? Yes, yes, yes. Yes, these are the ones. Uh, Joe Mitchell. -Uh, Helen Maris. -How do you do? Pleasure. Um, do you have-- [clears throat] Would you have a little contribution to the Joe Gould Fund? [hums a tune] Yes! This will come in handy. Did you think I forgot, Joe? Well, I know you have a lot on your mind, so... -[chuckles] -Good luck, Mr. Mitchell. Thank you very much. She's a good egg, but she's a little... ehh... [Mitchell] N-no, you can trust me. [Gould] I hope so. 'Cause should they fall into the wrong hands, my plans for them will be destroyed. -[Mitchell] Your plan? -[Gould] Yes, my will, my will. Two thirds of the Oral History I bequeath to Harvard alma mater and the other third to the Smithsonian. Unless I publish it first, of course. Oh, of course, Mr. Gould. -Joe. -Yes? No, call me Joe now. Oh, oh. All right, all right. -Joe. -That's good. That's good. Now where the fuck are we? Uh, I don't know, Well, tell me where we're headed 'cause I need to catch a train uptown... I know, I know. Aha! Raah! Well, hold-- Where are we headed? -Hold on! -[Gould yells] Sons of bitches! I knew it was tonight. They tried to tell me it wasn't happening, the fuckers. They're afraid. Let's go. Well, Joe, no, I really should be moving on. -Come on, come on! -All right, all right, all right. -Follow me. -All right. "Let none of this come to pass. Let the woodcutter awaken... Let Abraham come with his axe..." Oh, Freddie! Do you know Mr. Joseph Mitchell, the writer? -Shh! -I'm introducing him! -This is Mr. Mitchell. -How do you do? Welcome. Francis Lambert McCrudden. -You're here with-- -Yes! He's here with the rummy! -He's my biographer. -Oh, is that so? It is so. It is-- Tell him, Joe. [whispering] Yes, it is true. I am-- I am going to write a little something, -uh, about Mr. Gould. -[woman shushes] If I can-- Yes, I'm terribly sorry. Mr. Gould, though not a member, comes quite often. But I don't think it's for the poetry as much as for the food and wine. Mr. Gould is not serious about poetry. Oh, is that why you won't let me join The Raven? 'Cause I'm not serious enough for you, Frank? -Shh! -Most of your members are not serious. They write about such trite themes as... life, love, and death. -Thank you! -Yeah! -[Gould yells] -Thank you, thank you! -[Gould continues yelling] -Thank you, thank you! -Mr. Gould! -I have a poem! -Yes, I'm sure you do. -[grunting] Yeah! I have a poem. But we have some business to attend to. I have a poem about religion, short and sweet, like me. "My Religion," by Joseph Ferdinand Gould. "In the winter, I'm a Buddhist, In the summer, I'm a nudist!" -[crowd groans] -Please! Oh! Don't touch me! Thank you! Excuse me, sir. Fuckers! Take care of those composition books, Joe. The Oral History is my rope, my scaffold. My bed, my board, my wife, my floozy. My wound and the salt on it. My whiskey, my aspirin. My rock and my salvation. It's the only thing that matters a damn to me. All else is dross. [Gould] Civilization brings distinctions of caste apart from individual attainment. Thus is developed the patrician and the peasant. Each has a different set of virtues, and both are needed for the complete sum of humanity. When you find a patrician without pride or a peasant without avarice, you get very nearly the perfect person. In the eyes of the infinite... all pride is just dust and ashes. Ooh-hoo! Ah! Oh, gorgeous! Come on in, sweetheart, and you drink till you drop. -Ooh! -Can I, uh-- Cummings said there was a soiree. -Of course, Joe. Come in. -Can I come in? -Do you mind if I come in? -Oh, yes, yes. -Is he here? -No, not yet. How have you been? Oh, good, good. Spending time with my biographer. -Oh, really? -Yeah. Mr. Mitchell's with The New Yorker. -Hi. -Charmed. You've got to meet David and Janet, darling. They're reporters. David, Janet, this is Joseph Gould. Joe's a writer. He used to write for The Times. -Oh, right. -Darling, excuse me a moment. -Good to see you, Joe. -Yeah! -So you write? -No, I don't. -Oh, I thought she said-- -No, no, no. I don't read The Times, either. However, I do use it to keep my crotch warm on these frigid New York nights. [squawks] [indistinct chatter] [Freddie] Heh heh. Hello, Joe. Hello, Freddie, you old goat. Margaret, you have just been kissed by Joe Gould. I'm just gonna go on kissing. Hello, Joe Gould. Hello, Margaret! [laughter] Joseph Ferdinand Gould. That's me. Joseph Ferdinand Gould. Historian, aesthete... And though a direct descendant of William the Conqueror, I've always wanted to think of myself as belonging to the masses, not the classes. A certain lady once said to me, "Mr. Gould, you know, there are two types of gentlemen. One is a gentleman by the grace of God, and the other is a gentleman because of inherited culture. You belong to both types. Well, how right she was. [laughs] You... All right, everybody! All those in favor of a one-man show, say, "Aye!" Well, if you insist... All right, everybody! -Come on. Turn that off! -[crowd groans] Come on! Give me this! [clamoring] -Come on! Oh! -[shrieks] Okay. This one's for Margaret. The most beautiful girl I've seen in ten years! -[man] Come on, Joe! -So! This is an excerpt... from the Oral History of the World... Ah! Chapter 17! Oh, Joe! [cheers] Drunk as a skunk! [woman] Oh, my God! Oh, how I measured the heads of 1,000 Chippewa Indians... in zero weather! [Gould blubbers] [man] Give us a dance! I'll give you a dance I learned... on a South Dakota reservation from the Chippewa Indians. It's called the Joseph Ferdinand Gould stomp! Listen to this!

Ah... -What's going on? -I hate to bother you at this hour. I'm awfully sorry. But there's no room at the inn. Come in, Joe. Come in. I only have the floor. Oh, that's fine. That's fine. I'll get you a blanket. [groans] So how are things, Ted? Bad. Very bad. Not two nickels, you know. You know what I mean? I do. I do. [grunts] It's so cold out there. I know. It's okay. It's okay. -Go to bed. -Yeah. Thank you very much. -Thank you. -We'll talk in the morning. Good night. Good night. Good night. [Gould] Modern life brings a conflict not found elsewhere. Every human being has two primary impulses. One is to build a home. The other is for self-development. Being responsible for other lives is a handicap towards pursuing one's own ambition. The problem with marriage then is essentially how to give this worthy individual the right to parenthood and the chance to best express the best that is in him. I have never been able to adapt myself to civilization. It's--It's too needlessly complex and materialistic, and my father's death focused my attention to this point. It is in the presence of death that the collapse of civilization is seen. We would do better to stick to simple ritual and basic faith of savage life... and childhood. $5.00. [Gould] Are you kidding? [chuckles] Never. Well, look at them. Did you look at them? I did. I have. These are the tools of an artist, not just some hammering hack. He doesn't need them anymore? No, he doesn't. He's dead. He died. That's sad. Yes, it is. $10. Six. -These, these-- -What? They're what? Useless. They're useless. Except in his hands, and he's dead so $6.00, or get the fuck out. Thank you for letting me read them. You're disappointed. -No, no. -Yes, you were. I can tell. Well, to tell you the truth, I was. Uh, because honestly, um, from everything that I understood, y-you told me the Oral History was mostly talk, but there wasn't any talk in the chapters that you lent me. There are two kinds of chapters in the Oral History. Essay chapters and oral chapters. All you read were essay chapters. May I read some of the oral chapters? Are you having something? -Uh, yes, yes. -Two more beers, Jack, please. -I'll have a martini, please. -And two martinis. No, j-just the martini, just the martini. I don't care for beer. So just the-- Look, I have something to, uh, tell you. Thank you. Okay, uh... The Oral History. You know the Met? The museum? -Yes, the Metropolitan. -Yes. Well, they have taken a great many of their most precious paintings and stored them in a bombproof location for the duration of the war. Mm-hmm. Yes, I had heard that. -Really? -Yes. Mm. Well, I... I've thought about the Oral History, and it's precious. Not just to me, but to humanity. Mm-hmm. And I've decided to protect it in similar fashion. All right. And, Mr. Mitchell... I have a friend. The-- the Oral History... is wrapped in oilcloth and stored in a cellar... [whispering] on a duck and chicken farm in Long Island. Entre nous. [Gould sings] Thank you. Thank you very much. May I ask... why a duck and chicken farm? Would you bomb a duck and chicken farm? No. Would you look for the history of the world in a duck and chicken farm? No. Well... Okay. Well, um... all right. So... Well, is there any way then that, uh... Yes. I need $9.50. $9.50. Um... why? Well, $5.00 for a round-trip train fare to Long Island, 2.50 for a round-trip cab fare to and from the farm, and, uh... $2.00 for a box of chocolates for my friend... who owns the farm. Okay. When? Two, three days at the most. All right. Okay. [exhales] Here's three-- Well, why don't I just give you ten-- $10? -Oh, Joe. -And you can owe me 50 cents. -We'll do that. I me-mean, keep it. -Are you sure? -Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. -Okay. Keep the fifty cents. -God bless. -Sure. [Mitchell] It's a murder, you know? I-it's like a murder. -I know. -You know? -I know it is. -I mean, i-it's-- it's inconceivable to me that a building like this would be knocked down. It's-- it's-- it's 40 50 years old? Well, it was in the way of progress. -It was in the way of what? -It's in the way of the future. -Oh, well, yeah, I don't know about that. -What is that? -Look at that. Isn't that nice? -Put that down. -No, wait-- -Get your hand of there. [man] Excuse me, folks! -[Mitchell] Yes? -Uh, come out of there, please. -Well, we're just-- -Would you come out of there, please? -[Mitchell] Okay, all right. -What are you folks looking for? -Well, nothing, -Nothing, just-- Well, what are you gonna do with that? [Mitchell] I don't know. Just... [chuckles] take it home, I guess. [officer] Oh, I'm sure the city would love it if you took the whole pile home. [both laugh] Well, we don't really have the room. Just do me a favor. Don't go poking around where you don't belong. Somebody might get hurt. -[Mitchell] All right. Yes, sir. Yes, officer. -[Therese] Okay. -Have a good day. -[Mitchell] Yes, thank you. You, too. [Mitchell] All right. Okay. Is he gone? He's gone. He's gone. Okay, come on. I saw some over here I want to get. Okay. I ended up begging this woman. I begged her! Now, now, this is her niece? Yes! I said, "Look, I-I-- I've taken the trouble to make all this trip all this way, this-- this long trip, And-- and I know you can't, but you must try to understand the importance of this and write to your aunt in Florida. "Write to her yourself," she said. But why couldn't she just give you the keys to the cellar? The key-- because the keys are with her aunt in Florida. Couldn't she just call her aunt in Florida and have her send her the keys? That's what I kept telling this arrogant little b-- But all she said, "Well, it's none of my business" in a not very nice tone and I just left her standing there at a loss as to what to do. All right. Right. Here. What's that? Well, it's the chocolates that I bought for my friend who wasn't there. -I wasn't about to give them to the wretched niece. -Oh, no, no-- Come on. You paid for 'em. They're yours. -No, no. -Yes! I was gonna give 'em back to the pharmacy, Christopher's, where I got 'em, so that I could give you the money, -but they wouldn't take it back. -All right. Even unopened. Something about food and safety, new regulations. [stammers] They know me there. I've been going there for years! They give me aspirin from time to time to help me through a-- when I have a truly awful hangover. You know, a katzenjammer, I call it. -Yes. -Or, uh, you know, they give me Brioschi to help settle my stomach -when I haven't had a square one for a while. -Yeah, I know. They're really nice there. [coughs] The-- the father is-- Let me get a toothpick. The father's Italian-- Yeah, that's right. He was from Italy originally, but he anglicized his last name to circumvent the prejudice which befalls these immigrants. Ah, you would not believe. And he-- he's been very generous to a lot of bohemians. Not-- not just me, Joe, a lot-- Anyway, as I said, they-- they would not take back or could not take back these chocolates or I...I would be giving you the $2.00 it costs, cash right now. -I know, I know. -I mean, believe me, well, $2.70. But I mean, I paid the 70 cents out of my own pocket. But that's okay. Or-- or I was gonna use the money with your permission, of course, to phone my friend in Florida and-- and beg her to-- to, uh, mail me the keys to the cellar but I mean, I couldn't do that, because I'm flat broke because of the chocolate debacle. See, I mean... -No, I know. -And, uh-- -So-- -So, I mean, I have the number right here burning a hole in my pocket. You have the number of the woman in Florida? Mm-hmm. Yes. [coins jingling] Hello, operator. I need a number in Florida, please. Uh, Sarasota 76558. Uh, right. Money. Money. How much do you need? -Just give it to me. Just-- -All right. Okay, we got one, two... three, four. They-- No, there's one left. There you go. Uh, thank you. Thank you. Uh, operator, what part of Montana are you from? Really? Really? Well-- [laughs] Don't believe it. No, I just-- well, me? Well, I'm just-- I guess I'm a good listener, that's all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank-- She's from Chippewa Falls. That's right next to the reservation where I used to stay. -Did I ever-- -Yes, yes, you told me-- Shh. Hello? Hello?! Yes. [clears throat] Hello. This is Joe Gould speaking. Yeah. How are you? [sighs] Jack, may I have a beer please? [Gould] The last time I spoke to you, Florence, you had a bad leg. No, I'm just asking out of politeness, for goodness sake. Oh, thank you very much. [Gould] I couldn't care less if your leg fell off! -Hello? -[jiggling phone] [screaming] Hello?! You fucking bitch! You two-bit flaxen-- [Jack] Hey, hey! Joe, easy, easy, easy! [Gould yelling] -What the hell are you doing? -[Mitchell] What happened? What happened? "What happened?" "What happened?" -She hung up on me, that's what happened. -Why? Why? Why! Joe, you broke this part. So what if I broke it, Jack?! It's a fucking telephone! Jesus Christ! There are greater things at stake here than the fucking telephones! There's a thing of tremendous significance languishing in a cellar! That carries more vital words than your two-bit black bakelite bullshit box will ever carry! Jesus Christ, Jack. Rise above, will you? Rise above... the everyday, and step up to your depths! Okay, Joe... Joe? Joe? -[Gould yells] -Joe? [Gould] God! These people! Joe, Joe... -It's okay. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, it's all right. It's okay. They are trapped by the mundane, by bric-a-brac, trapped with no vision, no real... -purpose! -I know, I know. Servants. It's all right. It's okay. Only the artist is free, Joe. Because he is single of purpose. He knows what he wants and wants only that. But this, uh, frightens people. I don't know. Yes. I'm really sorry about all this. No, it's all right, Joe. -It's okay. -No, it's not okay. No. And if you're willing, I will... recite the Oral History for you. Pardon? I have an abnormal memory. In fact, I have what psychologists have termed total recall. I have lost whole chapters of the Oral History and reconstructed them from memory word for word. Word for word? Yes. [chuckles] [Gould] I have found that gin primes the pump of memory. So... the Oral History. I will quote from the section, "Good Men Are Dying Like Flies." Which starts with a brief biography of side-bet Benny Altschuler... the horse-race gambler, who stuck his hand with a rusty ice pick and died of lockjaw. Then I will quote... from an account an old stumblebum fighter once gave me. Huh. The Deacon. The Deacon... was a gloomy periodical drinker. Had been in his time a boxer, which is the reason that I refer to him as a stumblebum. He was under the impression that he'd lost his soul. [Gould] And he often saw things at night. One summer night while he was sitting in a doorway on Great Jones Street... [sniffs] he smelled sulfur... and looked up and saw the Devil walk past. And later that night on pier 26 he saw two mermaids. "They weren't exactly half-women, half-fish. They were more like half-women, half-snakes" he said. "And when they saw me sitting on the pier, looking at them, they held out their arms and wriggled and made certain other motions, trying to tempt me to come with them. And if I had done so, they would have wrapped themselves around me and dragged me to the very bottom of the river." "The history of a nation is not in parliaments and battlefields, but in what people say to each other on fair days and high days and how they farm and quarrel... and go on pilgrimage." [chuckles] Oral History, according to Yeats. That is the quote I told you I had read that altered the course of my life. [Mitchell] Mm-hmm. Your wife, d-does she mind you being out this late? Not at all. She thinks I'm with you. [Gould laughs] [up-tempo music playing] [typing] [no audible dialogue] [Gould] My biographer! -[women] Oh! -This is Mr. Joseph Mitchell. Get him a beer! Get him a beer! -Wonderful article. -So wonderful! So interesting. These are my friends, Anne and Betsy. How are you? Pleasure to meet you. You mind if I take your coat off? I'll take my coat off, all right. It's nice to meet you. -It's a pleasure to meet you both. Your name is? -Yes, Mr. Gould-- -Betsy? -Betsy. -And I'm Anne. -Now that's Anne, and I'm Joe. Your friend here has been telling us all about the Oral History. Yes, I have, and I've also been telling them about how I measured, you know, the-- the Indians. Oh, the heads of 1,000 Chippewa Indians in zero weather. He knows. He is well acquainted with a number of chapters. You must know each other very well by now. I mean, I know him so well that he's become part of my past. You have your drink. Is it okay? Yeah, I have my drink. thank you. -Joe, I just wanted to stop by and, uh... -Yes. give these to you. These are, uh, letters, that are addressed to you care of The New Yorker. And I-- and I thought that you might want them. Well, thank you. -I guess we're not your only admirers. -Yes! Well, let's open this. I don't normally get letters. I don't know anybody, so let's open it, shall we? Yeah. -He is quite a handful. -Yes, he is. I'm all fingers and thumbs here. -You live here in New York? -Uh, yes. We-- we work up in midtown. Now, there. They're related as well, I believe. Eh, what is this? Oh! Oh, you dropped something, Mr. Gould. "Buy yourself a drink on me, Tweed Wright." [squawks] Yack-a-doodle-doo! Look at this! Do they all got money in them? Must be a big fan of yours. Let's see. There may be more in here. There may be more. Let's see what this one says. -You're making out like a bandit, Joe. -I know. -Just a minute. Look, there's no money here. -Oh! Oh, I can't believe it, there's no money in theat. -Wait a minute-- -[Mitchell groans] -Sure there's no money? -What does he say? No, he says, uh-- This is from -a retired Naval officer... -Oh. and he says that, "I do love seagulls very much the way you do." -[Gould squawks] -"I feel that I too can understand their language." Well, isn't that something, you see? We have to get going. I didn't mean to interrupt you. Oh, no. We have to get going. -Here. Kook. -I understand. $2.00! $2.00! Joe! [laughs] Joe Gould! Joe! Oh, Franny. It's you. Heh. I just wanted to say I saw The New Yorker piece. Oh, yeah, yeah. I didn't know you could read. All right, Joe. I just wanted to say I loved it, and bravo! Thank you. Thank you so much. I just ran into E.E. Cummings, and--and we were speaking about you. and I thought perhaps that if you wanted to, uh, stop by next week, -you might enjoy it. -When is-- when is the-- Uh, Tuesday night. No, it could be bad for me. Well, you decide. Are you-- are you-- Are you asking me to join The Ravens, Franny? 'Cause I'll only come as a member, you know, fully fledged. Well, of course. All right, I'll think about Tuesday. I'll--I'll check my schedule, which is... -heating up. -[chuckles] No doubt. No doubt. Very good. Very good. -I-I'll see you Tuesday, then. -Yeah. [Francis] Perhaps. Oh, Joe! -Joe! -Yeah? Um, I know you don't intend such a thing, but the Oral History may well turn out to be a sort of X-ray of the soul of the Bourgeoisie. What makes you think that you know what I don't intend? No, I'm sorry, Sarah, -It's important. It's important. -Please! [Sarah] I'm sorry. He says it's important. Hi, Joe! [laughs] Do you have more? -More? -Letters! Letters! Uh, yes, I have-- I have more letters, yes. Okay. Here. Now, Joe, look. -Uh-- -What's this, only three? Well, I-- I don't write 'em. I only receive 'em. Look, Joe, it's just-- it's very difficult for me to get any work done, um, if you keep coming in here. All right? -Now not to be-- but-- -God damn! It's just-- I could--I could send you the letters at the Minetta. Or-- or I could bring 'em down there a couple of times a week -if--if that's what-- -They don't like me there. [sighs] -Why? -It's something I did with spaghetti. You started this, Joe. If you're gonna lie down with dogs, you're gonna have to expect to get up with fleas. Anyway, I've got some good news, some exciting news! Really? What would that be? I won't tell you. I'll show you. [Gould] Since your article, as you know, my notoriety has increased tenfold, oh, twentyfold. I'm invited to more parties than ever and the center of attention [Mitchell] And I know how you hate that. [Gould laughs] And so anyway, someone... through a friend of mine, a friend of a friend rather, got in touch with Vivian Marquie, whose gallery we went to. And this someone is rich and has decided to become my patron, giving me $60 a month, which pays for my room and board. Or should I say, giving it to Monsieur Gerard, the owner of this establishment, and then he sees to it that I have a little left over for cigarettes and car fare. But the condition for all of it is-- and this is the thing that bugs me-- the donor remains anonymous. But I will uncover her identity. My room. Come on in. Oh, hey. -Oh, well, this is very nice, yes. -Isn't it? Isn't it? Come on in. Right in. Right in. Look around. Look at these. Look at these. Oh, yeah. It's perfect. -I've got everything -Yes, you do. It's wonderful. And I see you have a... -Yes, I got one of them. -Yeah. With a moon-- I see the moon from time to time. It shines down when I'm lying on the bed and-- Try the bed! -Oh, no, no! -Yes! Come on! I insist. -All right. -I insist, Joe. You gotta try this bed. -You have to. -Oh, yes, that's good, yes. Get the legs up! That's how we do! Yeah, lovely isn't it? Oh, yeah, yeah, it's lovely. ♪ I once lived a life ♪ ♪ Of a millionaire ♪ ♪ Spending my money ♪ ♪ I didn't care ♪ ♪ Taking my friends out For a good time ♪ ♪ Buying 'em champagne ♪ Gin and wine. [vocalizing] [continues humming] [shower running] Dad! It's dinner! [Mitchell] Okay, I'll be right there. -Put this on. -I am. Me last. -[Therese] Okay, you sit down-- -[Mitchell] Okay. Honey, why are you showering now? Oh, I don't know. I just felt a little... Ooh! [Mitchell] Sit down, girls. Come on. [phone rings] [ring] [ring] Hello? Hello?! What?! No, he's sleeping right now. Who is-- Oh! Oh, well, it's nice-- it's nice to meet you, too, Mr. Gould. No, it's-- it's all right. I-I had to get up to answer the phone anyway. Yeah, well... Nothing. I-I'll tell Joe you called. Yes. I will. All right, bye-bye. [sighs] -Who was that? -Well... that was your Mr. Gould. [groans] He's not mine. Well, you're his. Now, why is he... -Well... -God damn it. -he's fond of you, Joe. -Why the calling? -He's what? -He's fond of you. No, he's not. He told me that he doesn't even like Southerners. [chuckles] I don't blame him. What do you expect? The story doesn't end just because the writer has finished writing. No, go away. -Why? -Well, just-- He's in the bathroom. -Who? -Gould. Oh, all right. I'll go in my office. -Don't tell him that I'm here. Oh, no. No-- -Well, then, just go in there. -I'll go in the office. -All right, all right, go in there. Sarah, would you tell Ross or whomever that that first commode is clogged. It wasn't me. It seems to be a reoccurring problem. Is he in yet? No actually, Mr. Gould, he's not. Oh, well, I'll just wait for him. Well, you'll have to wait a long time. I don't mind! [groans] Uh, about, um, two weeks. What?! [laughs] Well, yes, Mr. Mitchell is going away for two weeks. "Away"? Vacation. -"Vacation"? -Yes. Why... he never said that. He didn't mention that to me. -[mutters] -Well, I'm... Oh. Uh... Uh, eh, where? Well, I'm not sure, really. Um... down south, maybe. Oh. [chuckles] Right. Well, uh, okay. Well, is there... something you would like me to tell him if he calls? Excuse me? Is there something I should tell him if-- -The reason you came by? -No, no. I just came by because, um... I don't know. [chuckles] Well, I'll be sure to tell him. [Gould] Thank you, Sarah. Have a good day, Mr. Gould. [door closes] -This is your review? One line? -I hated it. Everyone loves this movie. -Did you see it? -Yeah. What'd you think? It's a piece of shit. All right! All right. -Good night, Mr. Ross. -Good night. Oh, Mitchell. -Yes? -Hey. Good stuff, Joe. -Oh, oh, well. -Good stuff! Thanks. Thanks very much. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. Nothing. You're sad. Are you sad? Well... a little-- [chuckles] No, it's just that... Every time when I finish writing something, when things end, I get a little, um-- This fella, um... It's not-- [chuckles] Forget it. Forget it. It's a great piece. -Great piece! -Oh, well, I know. I mean, thanks. Thanks, I know. It's just-- You're kind of a gloomy guy, aren't you, Joe? Well, I guess. [chuckles] Yes. Well... I'm no goddamn ray of sunshine myself. [Vivian] As bold and as jazzy as his paintings are, I think somehow in these drawings, he's managed to make them... He's managed to make them as bold, but somehow more intimate. They're so beautiful. But it's best, I think, if you begin there and kind of work your way around. There's, uh-- Most of these are... [clears throat] -[coughs] -are, uh, pen... Most of these are pen and ink. Except there are a few that are pencil, and if you'll see, I have a special fondness for that one. But, um... -Then there's this amazing piece. -Yes. Which... [chuckles] I keep looking at every day. And every day, I see something different, totally different. [chuckles] And, uh... Ode to Franz Kline. Poor old Franz Kline, hadn't a dime, not two nickels for rubbing together. His paintings were great, but he got famous too late, then his soul flew away like a feather. [squawks] -Joe, you can't. Please! -Okay, Vivian. All right. All right. Just give this to her. To whom? You know to whom. My patron. -No. What is it? -It's a communication. -No, Joe. -[man] Thank you. Oh. Thank you. Thank you so much. Shit! -Joe, look! -Will you give this to her, please? No, I will not. This is not the way it's supposed to work. Well, then tell me who she is. -I can't! -Why? Because I don't know who the hell she is. I've told you that. Now just stop this foolishness, and get on with your life. How can I?! How can I?! You have to, Joe. Vivian, how would you feel if you knew that somewhere out there in the world there was a woman who cared enough about you not to want to see you starve to death, but at the same time doesn't want anything to do with you. I know. I know. I mean, who is this woman? It plagues me. I know. Maybe she's a woman who had an illegitimate baby when she was young, and then one day, she picks up The New Yorker and sees that her baby was now a middle-aged man. -You see what I'm saying? -Yes. Yes, Joe. I-- no-- I'm not taking that. I wouldn't know who to give it to. What are you doing now, what's that? For the Joe Gould Fund. No, I'll leave. You don't have to pay me to leave. I am not paying-- Just take the money. -Take this. -I am not. -I told you. -Then forget it. You're not going to take the money? No, I'm not going to take the money -'cause I have money in my pockets! -Joe... I'm fine! Really! I normally despise the stuff. I have very few wants, like an Indian. Anyway, this is not about money. I just want to know. I'm sorry, Joe. I can't help you. [Mitchell] Yes? He's here. Oh. Okay. So, um, where was I? [Sarah] Vacationing down south for two weeks. -Okay. Did you call, um... -I did. -Okay. I'll be right there. -All right. Hi. -Hello. -[Gould] Hi, Joe! -How are you? -All right. Where we going? Oh, well, I have an appointment if you don't mind walking with me. -Oh, not at all. -Here. I have your mail. -How was your trip? -Uh, quiet. Huh. -[Mitchell] Bye, Sarah. -[Sarah] Bye-bye. [door closes] [Gould] Brooklyn? What's in Brooklyn? Oh, I'm working on a piece out there about, uh, Indians. Mohawk Indians. I-is this something new? Yes, it's a, uh, uh, uh, a-- a new piece. I'm talking to a fella out there, an old, uh, Mohawk, who, uh... Well, do you... you visit this fella every day? No, not every day. About two, three times a week. You know. They were part of the Iroquois Confederacy, were they not? -Uh, yes, they were, yes. -And now they're here in Brooklyn? -Yes, in Brooklyn. -They were the Ohkonwaga. -[Charlie] Joe! -Yes, as a matter of fact-- -Oh, Charlie, hi! -Aren't you supposed to be working? -I am working. I am working. -Yeah, yeah! I knew I should have been on the other side of the bindings. [laughs] Charlie, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Joe? Come over here for a moment. This is a good friend of mine, this is, uh, Charlie Duell. This is Mr. Joseph Gould. -Nice to meet you. -It's a pleasure. Though we've never met, I feel I know you somewhat, Mr. Gould. -Oh, why is that? -Well, I've been hearing about you and your Oral History from a great many people for years. You've become quite legendary. Well, anyone would who would attempt such a thing. True. True. Kenneth Fearing has been lavish in his praise of your work. Kenneth Fearing? How do you know Kenneth Fearing? -We publish Kenneth. -Oh, is that so? -And "we" as, uh... -My firm, Duell, Sloan and Pierce. -Yes, not very reputable at all. -No, no, no. -Especially that first fella. -No. You know, I don't know if you'd be interested, Mr. Gould, but I would love to read some of the Oral History. Some of it. some of it. Everybody wants to read some of it! Nobody wants to just read it! Well, from now on, I'm not gonna let anybody read just some of it. They're gonna read all of it or none of it. Well, I-I'll do that. You could bring it by the office or tell me where to go pick it up, and I'll start right away. No, no, it's entirely too bulky. Well, uh, bring it by in batches, I'll finish reading one part, and then I'll give you a call. -That's sounds-- Yes. -I don't-- I don't-- I-I-- 'Cause you have a phone where you are-- I don't have it. I don't have it. -You don't have it? -No. It's, uh, uh-- it's stored on Long Island. -And, uh, it's very hard to get there. -I see. Well, yes, but you do have some of it here. I mean, there-- there... Yeah, I have some of it. Yes, but it's all over. With friends and-- and places and I-- [stammers] You wouldn't be able to read my handwriting, anyway. Well, I have a secretary who's a wizard at hard-to-read handwriting. If you brought it by and sat down with her, -till she got the hang of your handwriting. -[squawks] -She's very good. -Maybe we could publish a book of excerpts. Excerpts?! No! Absolutely not! Absolutely not. It has to be published in its entirety, all or nothing. Well, if you don't let me read it, and it doesn't appear that you want me to, how can I tell if it's feasible to publish it in its entirety? I have always resolved in the back of my mind that the Oral History should be published posthumously, and I'm gonna stick to that. Because there are certain revelations in it that I wouldn't want the world to know about until after my death. Well, um... I admire that. Um, well, I'm late. So, uh... -You're late. -Good to see you, again. All right, nice to see you, Charlie. -And it's a pleasure, Mr. Gould. -Yes. -Glad to see you. -Bye. All righty. What was his name again? Uh, Charlie. Charlie Duell. Charlie Duell. What-- what time do you have? Uh, it's-- it's just-- just a bit after-- Listen, uh, I should-- I should get going myself, -because I hate to be late. -Yes. -So all right, um... -I've got an appointment-- Good luck in Brooklyn. Thank you very much. And I'll see you soon, Joe. -Okay, yes, sir. -All righty. All righty. Bye. [bartender] Let's go, man. Good night. [grunts] Fuck. You all right, Joe? Huh? All right. -Come on. -[groans] Okay. [indistinct conversation] I need to see him, even for a minute. Just-- two at the most! [Sarah] Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Gould. Look, I'm-- -Now I have your mail right here. -Oh, thank you, thank you. -Just two minutes-- -No, Mr. Gould. You know it is never just two minutes! Oh, my God, just please wait! [Gould yells] Oh, my God. I'm sorry, Mr. Mitchell. [Sarah] Could-- Oh-- Hi. Oh, Christ, what a hangover I've got today. And not a red cent to my name for a cup of even cowboy coffee. Um, I'll need you to make a contribution if you don't mind, at some point. I was up to all hours, because Monsieur Gerard has chosen this week to repaper the hallways. Not to mention the main cause of my restlessness, which is the fact... that I still don't know who my patron is, even though I've made dozens of phone calls, I mean, to-- Speaking, for instance, with an old friend of mine, there are two-- two sisters, Charlotte--Charlotte and Eleanor Adams. Who, when I asked if they were the ones supporting me, told me that if I-I-- if I called them again, they would phone the police. Well, they were so old anyway. They were really too old. And there was another woman, she was very rich, and I-I met her at a cocktail party in Washington Square, I think I had-- yeah, I had had a conversation with her about Edgar Allan Poe. And so-- So I rang her, but she was dead. [laughs] And-- and was dead for 12 years or so. And just countless phone calls to people who seem to fit the bill. but I-I just haven't had no luck yet. And it's driving me mad! So much so I have not been able to write, which I recently confided to a friend of mine. Who all he said was, "Go get a typewriter." So I told him pretty damn quickly, that William Shakespeare didn't sit there, pecking on some dirty, damned $95 doohickey! And Joe Gould doesn't either! And just looking at his face made me sick! And I longed, I longed... suddenly I longed to be on horseback again with a sturdy cayuse under me, speeding into the sunset with the ice breaking up the Missouri River. God damn it! My head is killing me! So you haven't been writing? Hm. No, I guess not. Does that bother you? No. Does it bother your friend, Mr. Duell? The absurdly persistent Mr. Duell? What exactly does that mean? Well, I find our accidental meeting, Joe... with your publishing pal a little insulting. I beg your pardon? Listen, if you want me off your back, if you want to get rid of me, just because you're now on to Mohawks, say-- just say so. But don't go trying to palm me off on some... two-bit book binder. Look, you told me that you lugged armfuls of the Oral History in and out of 14 different publishing houses. I was trying to do you a favor. You told me that you've been resolved that this would always be published posthumously, but I don't believe that. But what I am beginning to believe is that the Oral History doesn't exist. It doesn't exist at all. That the woman with the duck and chicken farm doesn't exist. That the belligerent niece doesn't exist. That the cellar that it's stored in doesn't exist. None of it exists. Nothing associated with the Oral History exists, because the Oral History doesn't exist. A few scribblings here and there, but really, no. It exists only in your mind... but you have just been too lazy to write it down. They want the last-minute changes on the story, Mr. Mitchell. Well, does it have to be right now? They're telling me it cannot wait. Okay, all right. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right, thank you. Joe... look... Uh, no, I-I dropped by anyway... Dropped by for a contribution. Well, all right, here. Let-- let me give you something. -No, no, it's fine. -No, no, I have a little something here for you. I do. Here. Please take this. Please. No, thank you. Oh, hi, Daddy! [Gould] The insane person is a victim of self-deception. Yet in a measure, we all have this virtue. One is his own imaginary creation of himself. If we could see ourselves for what we really are... life would be insupportable. Hence, I would judge the sanest man to be him who most firmly realizes the tragic isolation of humanity and pursues his essential purpose calmly. I suppose I feel about it in this way because I have a delusion of grandeur. I believe myself to be Joe Gould. [party chatter] -No, I write for a magazine. We both write for a magazine. -Oh! The same magazine. I don't read magazines. -Why? -You don't? Why? I just don't like the feel of paper. -Do tell. -Never heard that one before. I read the newspaper, and I read books. So if you write a book, I'll read it. -All right. -He's writing a book. No, no, I'm not writing a book. Uh-uh. No. No, you're writing-- Aren't you writing a book? It's about the South. Hey! An angel's arrived. [laughs] -About the South, huh? -No, no. Now what about the South? Well, no, it's not about the South exactly. It's about-- [clears throat] It's about a fella from the South who comes to, uh, New York City. And, um... Well, that's, you know... -Okay. -Yeah. Well, it's just about he comes here and feels more at home here than he does, um, uh-- -Back home. -Back home, yeah. Yeah, that's-- that's all. So, uh, well... what happens? Well, nothing. [laughs] No, no, no. -Falls in love with a woman who is, uh... -Uh-huh. uh, mysterious. Mysterious to him-- As mysterious as the city is to him. And, um, uh... she's Scandinavian. -That's nice. -Yes, yes. And he loves her. He loves her, and, um, well... Well, he, it's just about-- about he wanders around the city, walking and listening to people, and he runs into different people, people who... everybody represents a different part of the city, that-- that he encounters. Um, and, um, uh, Well, I should say that he was a believer at one time, but he no longer is a believer. -However, he does still see things in terms of religion. -Uh-huh. Um, so, um, and so the city becomes for him kind of a... a kind of hell. Oh, so he hates it? No, no, no, he loves it. He loves it. But, uh-- but, the, um, uh-- It's just walking through the city and listening to people, and, um... -It's-- the city's so full, you know? -Uh-huh. Um, and the people. Um, he's just... he's-- he's searchin'. -You know? -What's he searching for? I-I don't know. He doesn't know. [laughs] -Anyways, that's the gist of it. -Uh-huh. -That is the gist of it. -Yeah, yeah. Joe, that there, that-- that sure is something. -Well, it's something. Maybe. -How far along are you? Pardon? I say, how far along are you? Uh... well, not very. I just-- I was just doing a little... -Working it out. -Making no-- Yup! Exactly. -It's all up here. -[chuckles] Yes, sir. Well, now. Do you-- May I take one of your cigarettes from you? Well, yeah, yeah. [Mitchell laughs] [Nora] Remember not to step on the line! -Yeah! -You'll fall through the cracks! -Yeah! -And die! [giggles] -You're it! -[giggles] Doo-doo. Ah! -I died! -[laughing] Dad, where are we going? [Elizabeth] Yeah, where are we going, Dad? Dad? Dad? Uh, no-nowhere. I just, um... -Thought I saw someone. Come on. -Okay. [giggling] [radio broadcast playing indistinctly] Hello? Joe? Joe? [Mitchell] Oh, God. [Gould] Not long ago, I came upon a word in the dictionary that sums up the way I was as a boy and, for that matter, the way I am now. The word is "ambisinistrous," or left-handed in both hands. My father didn't know what to make of me, and my mother... Well, one particular evening, we were sitting in the parlor, and I was studying, and I happened to look up and saw that she was looking at me and that tears were running down her cheeks. And she saw that I saw her. And what she said, what all she said was, "My poor son. My poor son. My poor son." [door opens] [music plays over radio] [door closes] [applause over radio] What's it like outside? It's cold. Have I done something wrong? [Vivian] Joe, I don't know. How could she just turn against-- She can't do that. Maybe she can't afford it any longer. She's wealthy beyond... I can't! I can't! How am I supposed to live?! I know. When? I was told the end of December. -And that's it? -Your subsidy ends. [Gould] You're penalizing me because I don't live like most people. [Gerard] This is not true, Mr. Gould. Then why are you doing this? Because it is the policy of the Maison. Is it your policy to be cruel? Mr. Gould, please, don't make this uncomfortable for me. Uncomfortable for you? Uncomfortable for you? [mock French] Pardonnez moi, Monsieur Gerard, but I think that I'm the party being made uncomfortable here, not you. I understand. I'm sorry. Why can't you help me? Hmm? Why can't you be more flexible? Why can't you recognize the way that I live? That I don't live week by week, or month to month, like most people. -I understand-- -But day by day! -On a day-to-day basis! -I know. On a hour to hour basis, mostly! So then it only makes sense that I pay by the night. -No. -Why?! -Because you can't. -Why?! Because... you can't. This is not a flophouse. You're right! It's worse! [light piano playing] [music playing only] -Joe? -[Gould] Oh, who's there? Alice. Alice. Dear Alice. Oh-ho! Goodness. My eye's running. I couldn't see. -Yeah. How you doing? -Oh, fine. Fine. It's just, uh, cold, and I... Hey... will you buy me some breakfast? I'll make you some breakfast. [chuckles] So would you let me take this? Yeah. Be careful. Yeah? Very careful. I'll put it right here. [bell tolling] Give me your coat. Oh! I got it. I got it. All right, so... what can I get for you? Can you make me some spinach and vinegar? Sure. I just gotta run out for the spinach. Well, no, no. I'm sorry. I didn't mean-- -Don't bother, please. -No, it's not a bother. -No, no, no... -No, it's okay. [chuckles] I tell you, I can't hold anything down anyway, so a cup of coffee would just be fine. Can you do that? Coffee? -Sure. -Thank you. Coffee's all ready. I'll get it. Why don't you sit down? [groans] [Alice] How's the Oral History coming, Joe? Oh, it's, uh, you know... I don't really have the energy to talk about the Oral History right now, Alice. [sighs] Oh! My legs. [chuckles] [grunts] Go on. Nice. Thank you. [chuckles] Where you living now, Joe? Oh, flophouses mostly. Thought you were at the Maison. [chuckles] No, I left there. -Why? -A number of reasons. But mostly... Why, I just realized that I could not write a true account of the people of this city without being out a-amongst them. Once you start getting too comfortable, then the truth becomes elusive. -But, Joe-- -You know that as a painter Oh, yes, of course, but... there are levels... of discomfort. Yes, I-I know what you're saying. I know what you're saying, but it's just, um... eh, it just has to be that way. You have to take care of yourself, Joe, physically. You have to. Because... no one else will. That's, uh-- Yes. [Alice] Dear Mr. Mitchell, Joe Gould is in bad shape. He's using up his time and energy he should be devoting to writing getting together enough dimes and quarters for the bare necessities. It's killing him. I've always felt that the city's unconscious may be trying to speak to us through Joe Gould... and the people who have gone underground in the city... the city's living dead... people who never belonged any place from the beginning... people sitting in dark barrooms, the ones who are always left out... the ones who were never asked. There is a great danger that Joe Gould may never finish the Oral History and that those anonymous voices may never speak to us. [music playing only] [piano music playing] Good night. Bye-bye, Monica. See you later. -Excuse me. -Yes? I'm sorry to interrupt, but I was hoping to get a chance to speak with you before you go, Mr. Mitchell. -Yes. -I'm Kim Maxwell. -How do? Joe Mitchell. -Hello. This is my wife Therese. -Hello. -Hello. I'm a psychiatrist at Pilgrim State Hospital. Oh, well, I-I will definitely be leaving then. [laughs] No, no, no. I just wanted to let you know that we have an old friend of yours out there. -Where? At Pilgrim State? -Yes. The man you wrote about. Joe Gould. Oh. [Mitchell] Joe? I always forget how-- how pretty it is up here. I haven't been up to these parts in a while. Reminds me, uh... quite a bit of Fairmont. Very pretty. Well, you'll be happy to know that I brought you something. Um... I did some soliciting for the Joe Gould Fund. [chuckles] I went to, uh, Alice Neel and, uh, Harry Kolis from the Jefferson and Max and Sadie from the, uh, Vanguard, and... Well, anyway... I thought this might come in handy. Here you go. In New York... I was always going here and going there... soliciting for the Joe Gould Fund. It was hard. You get a train of thought and... there'd be a horn or a siren, and you lose that thought and then... lose momentum. The whole day... whole day would just be lost. But out here, it's kinda peaceful. Might be able to write out here. I'm glad I was able to see you, Joe. When you see all those folks... tell them... it wasn't... It was never a question of laziness. Bye, Joe. [Mitchell] Joe Gould died in 1957. Soon afterwards, many people who knew him asked me if I would help them search for the Oral History. I thought of telling them that I knew that the Oral History did not exist, but one of the things I have learned, going through life, is that there is a time and a place for everything. "Yes," I said, I would help them. "Yes, of course, I will."
