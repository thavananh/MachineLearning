(Bach's II-Adagio) HAMILTON: You know I once knew a guy who thought that every time he would kill someone it would keep death too busy to catch up with him... You have something I need, You were paid to do a job... You shouldn't have told SERGI about the case, you were not instructed to do so... THE WAITER: I was hired by SERGI, and I do what I want. I got a name and I did the job. HAMILTON: Perhaps I should have been more clear. SERGI will ask where the case went, you tell him you opened it, it was empty, so you dumped it. Here's a little extra... for the miscommunication. Next time any liberties will cost you. THE WAITER: Theres not going to be a next time... And I don't want your little extra. HAMILTON: Just take the money, you have absolutely no idea what kind of waters your thinking about swimming in... The sharks that swim in these waters are much bigger than you. I know what your thinking, your feeling cock strong... Your going to bite the hand that feeds you... But these people are not on your level, these are the big boys now... They don't walk into places guns blazing like the old west ...No... ...that's you... They just think about it, and you're gone... And anyone who remembers you is gone... Then you're not even a memory... They don't pull triggers... They just think about it, and you're gone. So take the money... THE WAITER: And if I don't? HAMILTON: Just take the fucking money! Don't be a wank! This is just a thank you... Hind sight it was probably better it was in your hands. Actually you did us a favor... So, here's what you'll do. When the car stops get out, leave the case. THE WAITER: And my other option is? HAMILTON: There is no other option. THUG: Fuck you asshole! THE WAITER: Hello... Just tell me where... Can you have them cancel the... (door knocking) THE WAITER (CONT'D): It's here, nevermind. COURIER: Ah yeah, hi, ah I have a delivery for ah this address but I don't have a name... THE WAITER: Yeah, I was expecting it... From Ronald Black. COURIER: And ah... I could go ahead and have you sign for this? THE WAITER: How could I sign if you don't have a name. (door slams) (ethereal, serene music) (ethereal, serene music) THE WAITER: You know they say you shouldn't stay in the sun for longer than 45 minutes... TIFFANY: Really... when "They" were giving you that life saving piece of advice... did "They" tell you that smoking causes lung cancer? THE WAITER: No... Must have missed that class... TIFFANY: Do you always spy on girls sunbathing... THE WAITER: I was just... TIFFANY: No wait... don't tell me... You came down here to check your mail...

TIFFANY: Cuz I might be disappointed and... THE WAITER: How could you be disappointed, you don't even know me... TIFFANY: You know you could be something lame like a web designer... Or worse a lawyer... THE WAITER: Do I look like a lawyer? Don't worry I'm not... Not a web designer either... TIFFANY: Don't tell me who you work for either... THE WAITER: I don't have an employer.

Okay... (gunshot echoes in the night) HECTOR: Saw you talking to my girl the other day... THE WAITER: She didn't seem to mind much. HECTOR: You know I'm a bouncer down at the OMNI CLUB right. Get ta kick yuppie prick's asses... every night... For a living... That's what I do... THE WAITER: And I'm not a yuppie. HECTOR: Whatever man... I don't want you talking to my girl... Now I'm not trying to be a dick about this, for certain annoying muthafuckers like yourself. I can get real... real hard. Fuck you up, make you my little bitch. THE WAITER: How long have you been out here rehearsing that line waiting for me... HECTOR: I ain't been out here long cuz... I know what time you get home. I know your schedule. THE WAITER: You don't know anything. HECTOR: Oh I know a lot... You don't know shit! THE WAITER: Really. I know that your fucking the whore in 207... I know you sell a little ecstacy on the side...

Leave this place. (gasps) (gasps) (offscreen: moaning) TIFFANY Moans intensely. PRIEST: Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. THE WAITER: It's okay... PRIEST: Mind if I sit. PRIEST (CONT'D): I do apologize for startling you. But we have a very old congregation here and, whenever I see a new young face I get a bit over zealous in welcoming them. THE WAITER: It's really okay... PRIEST: Okay then I am relieved, now how are you? THE WAITER: I guess I'm fine. PRIEST: You sure about that. Son this is the Lord's sanctuary, no man can judge you or harm you here... THE WAITER: I know... PRIEST: Then you must have thought it was the Holy Ghost standing behind you, the way you were startled. THE WAITER: Somebody I knew just passed away... PRIEST: Ah, sorry to hear that, loss is hard to deal with, it forces one to face their own earthly mortality... And their spiritual immortality... THE WAITER: I don't know which one is harder to face... PRIEST: Thus is the crux of faith... PRIEST: Thus is the crux of faith... DESK ATTENDENT: Welcome to hotel Granduca. THE WAITER: Frank Maro? DESK ATTENDENT: He's in the billard room. (crack of the billiard balls) HANDLER: You look like a ghost... THE WAITER: I've been worse. HANDLER: How you like my hotel? HOTEL GM: Sir, you have a message. HANDLER: Thank you. THE WAITER: It's a nice place... THE WAITER (CONT'D): So you got news for me? HANDLER: You know the news... You do good work, clean work... THE WAITER: So what's the situation? HANDLER: It's not your fault about the girl, it's bad intelligence... THE WAITER: How so? HANDLER: It's gotten complicated. HANDLER (CONT'D): Your in the middle of something... And it's deep and it's dirty... THE WAITER: How dirty are we talking? HANDLER: Filthy... Nasty... HANDLER (CONT'D): One's screwing the other one and they're both screwing a lot of people, and your gonna wind up in the middle. THE WAITER: So what's your advice? HANDLER: Just give the package to the client and clean up. It will save you some running, and I'll make sure that they compensate you.... THE WAITER: I'm not gonna do that... Yet I trust you with my life, and you just keep putting me out there like that? HANDLER: And I would never ask you to... But it isn't me asking. It's just what's got to be done. THE WAITER: The girls not an issue. HANDLER: Maybe not to you, but to others she's an issue. She makes you... Everybody takes a fall. THE WAITER: This is sloppy. The courier, that was their mistake... And it's your mistake for letting them make that mistake. HANDLER: True, but now it's your problem and you gotta deal with it. Kid this is so deep... Too deep for you... Now get the hell out of here. Now get the hell out of here. HAMILTON: Have a drink with me to help celebrate our new working relationship. HAMILTON: I could always use someone with your skills... THE WAITER: Sorry, I get restless in cubical jobs. HAMILTON: So what do I call you? THE WAITER: Call me whatever you like... HAMILTON: No names, right... So you don't even have a nickname you give people? THE WAITER: No, too cliche... Kind of like this limo, and your goons. HAMILTON Right, right, right... So are you going to deal with the second half of the assignment soon... My people are getting anxious. THE WAITER: It'll be done. HAMILTON: By tonight 8'oclock sharp... Your man will be contacted. He'll be told where you need to be. THE WAITER: Okay. Is that all? Or are you following me just to ask me my name. HAMILTON: No, I need the briefcase you were given. THE WAITER: No. HAMILTON: What do you mean no... I hired you... THE WAITER: No, my client hired me, my client will pay for it. You provided a mark. If you have a problem with not receiving the package take it up with the Russians... They are your partners alright. HAMILTON: You have to understand the chain of command, if I don't do what the people above me want, I get shit on, if I get shit on, you get shit on... THE WAITER: I think we're done, stop the car. HAMILTON: We're not done until I say so. THE WAITER: Stop the car. LIMO THUG: We'll tell you when it's time to stop. (Glass shatters, man screams in pain) THE WAITER: We...ARE... DONE. HAMILTON: Tom, stop the car. TIFFANY: Hey Bobby! You look nice... HECTOR: What the fuck was that shit... TIFFANY: What... I... HECTOR: WHAT! GO AHEAD, HIT ME! TIFFANY Fuck you! HECTOR: Once a dumb bitch... Always a dumb bitch... I knew wanna ta fuck him... You stupid whore... TIFFANY: It's not like you don't fuck who ever you want with your little dick! (three knocks at the door) HECTOR: This is perfect... I hope it's him... Now you're gonna get to watch me fuck-up your new boyfriend! It's him... What! Isn't this perfect! Wassup?! Come on white boy... Be a hero... Come on... HECTOR (CONT'D): Ahh...! TIFFANY: How do you like it you stupid fuck! THE WAITER: Should I stop? TIFFANY: Fuck him... THUMP! TIFFANY: What did you do with him? THE WAITER: He's in the alley... TIFFANY: Is he OK THE WAITER: What is this, is he okay? Five minutes ago you were telling me to fuck him up? Now you care? TIFFANY: I was angry... THE WAITER: Oh you were angry... Okay, next time I'll remember that. I'll just let him beat the hell outta you. TIFFANY: He has friends. He'll come after you... THE WAITER: Are his friends cops...? TIFFANY: No. THE WAITER: Would he call the cops. TIFFANY: No... No way... THE WAITER: Then I think I'll be fine... TIFFANY: Why are you being like this. THE WAITER: I am being like me. It's who I am... I don't think you know who the fuck I am. and I sure as hell don't know who you are. Some guy's beating the hell out of you and I stop him and all you care about's him? How's he doin? You know what, he's in the dumpster, go find him. Have a happy life together. TIFFANY: It's not that simple... We've been together for like 8 months... and yeah he is a fucker... But you can't stop caring about somebody in a couple seconds... THE WAITER: I can. TIFFANY: Oh you can... THE WAITER: Yeah... I just did. TIFFANY: You don't mean that. THE WAITER: I got somewhere to be. (seagulls cawing) (waves breaking) (shouting in russian) HAMILTON: Ivan, you look like you've lost weight. Why, you're almost petite. IVAN: Shut the fuck up. HAMILTON: Ahh, and such a delightful personality. SERGI: We are hearing very upsetting things, we like to know, where the fuck our money is? HAMILTON: I have been assured that all the documents are secure and will be delivered soon. We will take care of all the loose ends. IVAN: Nothing is to happen to KINSKY. HAMILTON: How are we suppose to make this go away with potential problems walking around. SERGI: Mr. HAMILTON, have you lost your faith in us? HAMILTON: I just don't think it's wise, what if he gets picked up and talks? IVAN: He won't be, and if he is... we will deal with it. What happened to your face? THUG: Fuck You! Tell your mother I said hello. HAMILTON: The guy you hired for me is a bit of a nut case, he needs to be dealt with... IVAN: Oh, is that what happened to your face. (laughs) (lip smack) (ethereal choral music) PRIEST: Glad to see you found your way back.... THE WAITER: I needed somebody to talk to... It's been a long time since I've confessed... PRIEST: Well you've come to the right place. THE WAITER: You ever had a friend that you haven't talked to in a long time and just don't know how to talk them anymore? PRIEST: Yes. A friend... But never to my Father. Why don't you start with 'hello.' I think it'll get easier. We all have something to talk about with Him, you're already here so you must want to talk about it... So just start talking. He's here... He'll listen... He's here... He'll listen... (loud rock and roll music) HANDLER: Hey kid... Relax...sit. (cont.) That's Summer... She's a very bright girl. THE WAITER: Is this going to take long... COCKTAILER: Can I get you something...? THE WAITER: Gin and tonic... HANDLER: You know... a man with a clean conscience... is a man with an empty bottle of gin... THE WAITER: Then I'll have a whisky and cola. So should I order you one? HANDLER: Make mine a Scotch... Have you ever noticed that strippers have small bladders? Always going to the restroom... THE WAITER: No, I tend not to spend much time or money on them. HANDLER: You should start investing in their future. THE WAITER: Really what's your current rate of return on a stripper? HANDLER: I'm just saying, you got time, it's a hobby, man's gotta have a hobby. THE WAITER: I'll think about it... HANDLER: I don't come here for girls, I come here for the environment... this place is one big social kaleidoscope... It's amazing, sociologically... It's a microcosm of our world... Ya got the have's the have not's... The desperate, the fortunate... Who is using who... Who's fucking who? KINSKY: Sit down sweetheart.... STRIPPER: I thought you'd never ask. KINSKY: My name's Kinsky... Kinda rhymes with kinky doesn't it... It's funny how it does that... STRIPPER: I...I like that. I like that... KINSKY: So what do they call you? STRIPPER: They call me Cinnamon. KINSKY: Cinnamon? I can see why. What's your real name? CINNAMON: Don't you want to know what Cinnamon tastes like? HANDLER: Take him for example... He's got money, she's got youth... And she has a boyfriend and you can tell she doesn't like him pawing her. So... Who's using who? THE WAITER: They're both using each other... HANDLER: Wrong... THE WAITER: He's using her, cash he's giving up he doesn't care about. He has got plenty of it... She doesn't have a lot of respect. HANDLER: I didn't look at it like that... Very poetic... But your still wrong... You're wrong because I am using both of them. She was paid to keep him content 'til you got here... See, I've made designs on that man's life... You ever look at a guy like that and think... He has no idea... Soon he will cease to be. THE WAITER: We'll all cease to be. What does it matter? HANDLER: Ah, but you know when that moment will come. He has no idea of those designs... Now the question is... Does someone have designs on your life...? THE WAITER: You trying to tell me somethin'? HANDLER: You become a pawn, a patsy, you're disposable. That man over there is the key to find out whose making those plans. Now I'm telling you when another man makes designs on your life, You kill that man... Now don't get to distracted that you forget to work. * I use to work in Chicago, * in a department store.... SUMMER: He paid me a lot of money to take care of you... And I'll do whatever you want to make you stay. THE WAITER: Anything? SUMMER: Anything... THE WAITER: Can you leave? KINSKY: Don't leave... And order me another round okay? KINSKY: See something you like? Sure you're in the right strip club? KINSKY: 'Scuse me. Where's the fucking black bitch? WAITRESS: What are you talking about? KINSKY: Cinnamon. She took fucking forty dollars of mine. Goes off to get a fucking drink. I come back here and I find you... WAITRESS: Calm Down THE WAITER: Kinsky! KINSKY: What? (Punch) THE WAITER: Sit Down. WAITRESS: Okay, okay, okay... THE WAITER: You're not a part of this. Get up! KINSKY: This is not fucking good! THE WAITER: Give me your fucking keys. I'm driving... Give your fucking keys. KINSKY: Where are we going? THE WAITER: To the Russians... KINSKY: Oh Holy Fuck! You don't know what your getting yourself into... Your gonna fuck both of us... How much do you want? I can pay you. THE WAITER: You don't have enough money. Get in the fucking car... NOW! KINSKY: They're gonna kill me... I don't want to die... Why the fuck are you doing this? Is it money?! THE WAITER: Calm the fuck down... Tell me the situation... Who's involved? KINSKY: Listen... You don't even want to know... I can't tell you. THE WAITER: Then tell me a story. Make it a bed time story... Something that never happened, but you better keep my interest. KINSKY: Alright... I'll tell you a hypothetical story... Just hypothetical, that's all... It's a umm... It's a hypothetical situation! THE WAITER: Tell the story. KINSKY: It's hypothetical... Okay? THE WAITER: Tell the story. KINSKY: Okay, but it's just hypothetical... THE WAITER: Tell the fucking story!! KINSKY: Story begins... Once upon a fucking time and all that bullshit, because it's purely hypothetical. There are four groups and each is getting something from the other... You've got a government leader with an agenda, a corrupt inter-national energy company, world wide terrorist organization, and you got a hand full of ex-KGB agents turned euntrepreneurs. Each of these groups wants something and the other groups can afford them what they want. First you got your government leader... And he's a fucking cowboy and he wants to launch a 21 century fucking crusade. The energy company. They've already profited from putting this leader into power in the first place, and now they realize they're gonna profit wildly from instability in the region where this crusade is to occur. Now your ex-KGB contingent... They've already sealed a deal to fund an international drug smuggling operation utilizing the shipping resources of the very same company. I hope your taking notes 'cause I'm gonna ask questions later. The bosses at the company... They realize that there's a good profit to be made. So they're willing to just give up their morals for a little while. And they think that everything's going to go great. But... Something bad happens. and a loss here and a loss there and pretty soon they're losing millions... Billions... And nobody can account for a fucking dime. So they sell their soul for the all mighty dollar and they broker a deal that's gonna make everybody happy. They persuade the Ruskies to aid the terror cell, just a little bit to do something to give probable cause to the crusade. Ya follow me... Now everybody's happy, the towel heads think they've earned their 76 virgins, the company's got it's unstable region, and the government leader, well... Yippe- eye-yay-kye-yay he thinks that he's gonna have himself a righteous fucking crusade. Ruskies... All they care about is money. But again...something happens, something goes wrong, shareholders start to hear rumors that the company is bleeding money. And they jump ship. And then everybody's jumping ship. And the ship's going down and eventually... They're gonna find out where all the bodies are buried... And they'll know who caused the ship to sink. You seem to be a reasonable man... What do you want? Is it girls? I can get 'em for you. Boys? Hey... More power to ya. Please... You can't take me to them... I'll pay you whatever it takes. THE WAITER: Looks like you went swimming with the sharks, and now you're complaining 'cause you got bit. KINSKY: Fuck you... (gunshot in the distance) (music swells) (intense upbeat chase music) (BANG!) (gunshot echoes in garage) THE WAITER: I hope you don't have somebody waitin' on you... 'Cause you're not lookin' so hot, buddy. THE WAITER: Now, I just wanted to talk to you. So who hired you? Listen man... no hard feelings you would have done the same thing. You and me are in the same boat. You serve? Gulf? You're not a real big talker are you? That's cool. Want a cigarette? (coughing) They're not good for you... Don't want it? THE SHOOTER: I... don't... smoke... (coughing) THE WAITER: Yeah, it'll kill ya. (ambient music) (radio playing) ANNOUNCER: A small upscale community of Sugar Land. Police have found the body of Ford Bynum. Dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Bynum leaves behind- (radio dial clicks off) (phone rings) THE WAITER: Yeah... Do they think it was me? No, it's a Latin guy... Mid 30's... Had some tats... Definitely ex military. What time? So I take it, Kinsky's my problem? I'll take care of it. TIFFANY: You moving out? THE WAITER: I'm goin' on a trip... TIFFANY: A permanent trip? THE WAITER: What's up with all the questions... Why don't you go find your boyfriend... TIFFANY: Are you hurt? THE WAITER: No, I'm fine. TIFFANY: Look, I'm stupid... Fuck Hector... I'm sorry... THE WAITER: Okay... TIFFANY: Are you in trouble? THE WAITER: You could say that. TIFFANY: Where are you going? THE WAITER: Somewhere...I don't know... away from here... TIFFANY: Can I take care of your head before you bleed to death? TIFFANY: Sit. So, should I even try to figure out what happened to you? THE WAITER: I fell. TIFFANY: You fell... Okay... There you go. THE WAITER: Thanks. TIFFANY: You're welcome. I owe you anyway for stopping Hector... so thank you. THE WAITER: You don't owe me anything, he was askin' for it. TIFFANY: That really must have been some fall, got your neck too. Stay here tonight... THE WAITER: I have to be somewhere. TIFFANY: Then stay here for now... THE WAITER: Why are you doing this? TIFFANY: Cuz I want to... THE WAITER: Listen, You don't owe me anything. TIFFANY: Look this isn't... THE WAITER: I'm not the relationship type... TIFFANY: This isn't about me owing you anything. and I don't want to fuck you into a relationship... I just want to fuck you... Is that so bad? I mean night after night you hear me, aren't you the least bit curious...? THE WAITER: No. (love making music) TIFFANY: Wow... I just had sex with a guy and I don't even know his first name. THE WAITER: My name's Bobby, remember you gave it to me. TIFFANY: Yeah but, I don't even know what you do... THE WAITER: Do you really need to know? TIFFANY: It would be nice... THE WAITER: I think it's better this way, there's less ties between us. TIFFANY: Okay, um... now I feel like a complete whore. THE WAITER: Well I hope you're not... because I don't have any money. TIFFANY: Asshole. Tell me something... Make me feel less like a slut... Tell me a secret. THE WAITER: I really hate it when people ask me what my name is and what I do. So many people are defined by those questions... It's like it's the medieval times. With Dick the cobbler and Jane the fucking whore. THE WAITER (V.O.) It's nothing less than the quantification of humanity. And we do it to ourselves. You know I hate working for people, basically they're just asking you to do what's beneath them. Sometimes I look in the mirror after I shave and don't recognize myself. It's like when you put on a new suit... Well not necessarily new, like new to you... You become a new person. Have you ever watched another person sleep, when you really watch 'em, day after day... Their eyes twitch... you study their breathing... I don't think there's anything more intimate. It becomes a part of you. I always like to watch my lover sleep... You forget about yourself and you can almost feel what they're feeling in their dreams. Have you ever thought... There's a whole other world in somebody else's mind, and there are about 6 billion other minds out there... Makes your perspective seem rather insignificant. I think a lot of people lack perspective. I see it every day, the same empty salutations and one line cliches. MAN AT METRO: She must love you... THE WAITER (V.O.) Makes you wonder... MAN AT METRO: I said, she must love you. Love you enough to a marry a muthafucker without a car. Sit'en up here waitin' on the train like the rest of us. Got a suit on and shit. That some nice shoes... I said that some nice shoes. Where you get them from? A shoe store or somethin'? It's alright you ain't got to talk. Ol' upity muthafucker... Have a nice day mutha fucker. THE WAITER (V.O.) When someone wishes you to have a nice day... What would they sacrifice for a stranger, for them to really have a nice day...? Would they give you a quarter? Would they give you a parking space? Would they give their life? Or even just like a smile?... People that are imprisoned seem to have perspective, however when they're freed for some reason all that perspective goes out the window... I think it comes from not being able to move... when you can't move you wait and you watch... You really start to see people and their true nature and time... And it's true nature just moving. I feel like a prisoner... My clock has no hands. Life is just motionless... I feel like I'm bound by servitude that I chose and in essence I'm trapped in my own body... It's much like how humanity has largely trapped itself in cars. (art gallery crowd noises) VITO TIERI: Who's in charge here? I need somebody that speaks English! Why isn't this wine chilled properly? CATERING MANAGER: I'm very sorry sir we'll take care of it. THE WAITER (V.O.) Just think about it... We move yet we are essentially motionless. People don't even realize just sitting in their living room on their couch... They're traveling something like 67,000 miles a minute. They're not even moving. I have a desire yet not the capacity and there is the paradox. Like a run away train, I'm the conductor and can see the end of the tracks. Most people are too distracted by the ride to realize... the end's coming. You know I wonder if it's a blessing, I suppose it dissolves the tedium. VINCENT TIERI: I can handle it. MYSTERY MAN: You're playing with gas and matches! VINCENT TIERI: What the fuck do I care what happens, the whole fuckin' house could come crashing down as far as I'm concerned, I'm close enough to watch and far enough to not hear the crash... Hey, I'm clean. No way any fucking thing comes back on me... MYSTERY MAN: Is it worth it? VINCENT TIERI: I don't think about that shit. I mean they're not smart enough to get themselves out of the fucking desert, we didn't think they'd be smart enough to do something like that. MYSTERY MAN: They weren't... Without you... And that's my point. VITO TIERI: What the fuck. Do you know who I am. Do you know what you're doin?... TIFFANY: So... I still don't know who you are or what you do... THE WAITER: It's a short story... with no end... (distorted voices) Mercy. (wind rages) (distorted voices) (loud gunshot is heard) TIFFANY: It came from your apartment... THE WAITER: Lock the door, stay here... TIFFANY: What are you going to do...? THE WAITER: Don't call the cops... (choking on blood) THE WAITER: It's ok. Who sent you? Was it Hamilton? (gunshot) TIFFANY: Leave me alone... leave me alone! THE WAITER: Tiffany...You don't understand what's going on. Let me explain... TIFFANY: Understand?! I don't want to understand! THE WAITER: They were there to kill me. Would you rather me be dead? TIFFANY: Leave... THE WAITER: Tiffany! Not everything's black and white. TIFFANY: Leave... Just go... The cops are on their way... THE WAITER: I told you not to call the cops. TIFFANY: Just go... THE WAITER: I'm sorry. TIFFANY: It's too late for sorry... (gunshot) (dark music plays) HECTOR: Hey white boy! Remember me? (Club music plays) RUSSIAN THUG: Maleck, he's here. LESTER MALECK Where the fuck you think you're going? You got ID? Check his ID I know he ain't 21. Go ahead check him... CLUB DOORMAN: ID? LESTER MALECK: It's okay... (loud thumping beats of club techno music) LESTER MALECK: Small world huh? THE WAITER: Yeah... LESTER MALECK: I heard there was a guy causing a lot of noise, I shouldn't be surprised it was you... Fuck up... THE WAITER: Looks like that retirement plan didn't work out for ya... To much Enron in the 401k? LESTER MALECK: That's life buddy, taking jobs where ever I can now. THE WAITER: Looks like you found this one up somebody's ass... LESTER MALECK: Hey. It's just a fucking paycheck. THE WAITER: Just bustin' your balls, We all got to slum it sometime... LESTER MALECK: Listen you fuck! Don't get it twisted... There ain't no rag heads anymore and there ain't no sand in our boots... And we ain't on the same side. I'll take you down like a fucking dog! Understand? THE WAITER: Don't worry... I wasn't confused for a second... LESTER MALECK: I always envied you. THE WAITER: Why's that? LESTER MALECK: Cuz I think ya got a screw loose or you just got no soul at all... I kinda wanna think you got a soul, cuz I like ya... You always made me laugh. I'm not going to be around for the day... But one day you're gonna end up like me. You know I got a bum ticker from the old man. And what? A pocket full of worthless tin medals and memories from a war that should have been lost and forgotten except for losers like us?! That have the reality and the realization that our own were getting killed... Our own! No... I don't think so. And now I'm workin' for the same shit heads that we fought 20 years ago. So I can get a... new hip so I can walk... Why? Because I want to fuckin' walk. So you don't judge me! Look at yourself. Get your shit together. THE WAITER: You make a pretty convincing argument. LESTER MALECK: I hope so. If you don't do something now, you got problems. Get your shit together. Get out. Go. THE WAITER: Where the fuck am I supposed to go...? LESTER MALECK: It's a big fucking world out there kid. What do you want to end up like an old cog like me?... When the machine chews you up they spit you out and turn you into scrap metal. Look. We ain't friends... But we ain't enemies either... If you ever need me... you come find me. Now you look at yourself and you look at that soul. And I'm gonna say a prayer for you. Fair enough? LESTER MALECK: I'll see ya... Hey make sure you frisk him too, will ya? Don't forget to check the sack. It's where he likes to hide his shit... RUSSIAN THUG: I got you, boss. LESTER MALECK: You're forgetting pieces about yourself kid. Remember you don't change now, there won't be anything left. RUSSIAN THUG: He's clean. THE WAITER: Take care of yourself Maleck. I'll see you around someday. LESTER MALECK: I'll be waitin' right here for you princess. SERGI: So glad to see you. Please have a seat. IVAN (in Russian) Hey...Idiot... RADINOFF (in Russian): Mind your own business! SERGI: Drink. It wasn't a question. Is that for me? THE WAITER: That depends, are we done? SERGI: Yes, of course... (to other Russians) I love this guy... You tell him something to do, he'll take care of it. You know Americans are only nothing but style. When I was in a Soviet army my job was take picture of in a neutral airspace, American planes... The pilots and the serial numbers. Those American pilots, they used to take their helmet off, comb their hair, and after then they say take my picture now... I said this is cool, you know... I have to go to America. (laughter) SERGI: Do you know what I wanted to do, I want to become a movie star... Cold War was gone and I saw there is another opportunity... World needs more Kolichnakovs, machine guns, so I moved to America... Now look at me... What was your question? THE WAITER: Are we done? SERGI: We're done... As soon as you take care of the little girl. THE WAITER: She didn't see anything. SERGI: Clean up your shit... Are we clear? Not your fault, Hamilton fucked up. We know he was gonna screw us... THE WAITER: You knew? SERGI: We know everything... We know Hamilton was gonna have you killed... THE WAITER: Thanks for telling me. SERGI: We want to see how good you are... Knowledge is a power... Did you know you had access to 40 million dollars in your breiefcase... I bet you wish you knew that... You would asked for more money.... There is one thing we don't know... THE WAITER: And that is...? SERGI: Kinsky is gone. Do you know where he is? THE WAITER: No. SERGI: Did Hamilton mention him? THE WAITER: I don't remember. SERGI: Kinsky is not to be harmed. If he's harmed, we gonna come and see you... THE WAITER: And why is that? SERGI: For your services of course... We have agreement... You kill the girl. So... Now... Do you want a drink? THE WAITER: No. SERGI: Then get the fuck out... IVAN: My money is on Hamilton kills him... SERGI: You are a Greek, I can tell... Greeks use to run the ports of Houston... They built this town. That's why there are so many titty bars in this town! In the 80's FBI, they ran them out. They regret it now... Do you know why? Because the Greeks cared... I don't give a fuck if it's a little girl or fucking puppy. I'm here.. I'll take care of it. Get out! LESTER MALECK: Ah, you Sonofabitch fucking asshole... If your gonna do it, do it. Do it. If I don't finish this job I'm as good as dead anyway. Hey kid... It's the last run... It's the last run... THE WAITER: No... I'm taking your advice. You should do the same... It's a big fucking world brother. LESTER MALECK: Yeah. THE WAITER: Everybody stay where you are. You move, you die. SERGI: Ivan already left with the case. THE WAITER: I didn't come for the case, I came to clarify something. You're not going to touch that little girl. Are you? SERGI: Is that a question? I'll make sure she screams when I... (multiple gunshots) THE WAITER: You leave this room, you die. THE WAITER: Hey laughing boy. I'm gonna need that case. Well then I'm gonna need the key too. Don't make this difficult. I'm already runnin' out of bullets, killing all your friends... (gunshot) (grunts of pain) IVAN (OS): What are you waiting for? THE WAITER: Why didn't you just give me the key. (gun misfires) I guess you're fat AND unlucky. (calm, jazzy music plays) DRIVER Fuck you, asshole! (gunshots) THE WAITER: You shouldn't have opened the case. I want a name. (gunshot) (harps swell) (dream-like trance music) FEMALE VOICE: Peace. THE WAITER: Sorry I startled you. Did you think it was the Holy Ghost this time? PRIEST: Actually I was thinking Jesus. THE WAITER: I'm sorry for the burden I put on you... PRIEST: Burden is yours, and I'm the one who's truly sorry. THE WAITER: No, I told you too much. PRIEST: No, your words and deeds are between you and the Lord. And no burden is too great for Him. THE WAITER: You don't understand. PRIEST: Yes, I do... Yes I do. YES, I do. THE CEO: Christ! You scared the hell out of me... Do, uh... Do you have an appointment? I think you better leave... I've just pushed the security alarm... The guards will be here in a few minutes. THE WAITER: And you'll be dead by the time they get here. THE CEO: Are you crazy? Is this some kind of a sick joke... What do you want? THE WAITER: I want to know was it worth it... THE CEO: What? THE WAITER: All those innocent people died. And for what? So you can have some more money? I've given all the papers to Ford Bynum's widow. And I want to know was it worth it? What's the difference between having a hundred million and 20 million in your bank? THE CEO: What the hell are you talking about... No don't... Please.... Please put that down.. Don't... Please put that... Oh God.... No please.... (gags) (falls onto desk) (triumphant ballad plays) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
