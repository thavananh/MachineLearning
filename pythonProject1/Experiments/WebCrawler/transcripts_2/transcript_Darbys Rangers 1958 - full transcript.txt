foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- The American rangers, whose legend was written under the name darby's rangers, were created at the darkest hour of our history when the enemy held half the civilized world and no man could foretell the future. To William Orlando darby and the men who fought with him, this motion picture is devoted. Morning, Saul. Morning, major. There she blows, major. Hallelujah! They bought it, Saul. They bought it. We're practically on our way overseas. Congratulations. Why the long face? You've become fond of the war department? Chance to have our own combat unit, and you cloud up. You better take a look at the general's appointment list. "Major Warren, major mulkby, colonel Reynolds." They're being interviewed, major. Interview for commanding officer of the new battalion. The general made the appointments himself. Sergeant, you cancel these appointments. Just one of them sees general wise, you'll wind up patrolling a beach in California, and without a dog. I can't do that. You'd better or I'll chew those stripes off your arms. Got to calm down. I can't talk to the general this way. Morning. Morning, sir. Morning, sir. [Door closes] Get on the phone and cancel those appointments. Mazel tov. Do you know about the twx, sir? I heard about it yesterday. Congratulations, bill. Thank you, sir. I took the Liberty of canceling your appointments with majors Warren, mulkby, and colonel Reynolds. You did? Why? I concluded they weren't as well-qualified as another officer. Who's he? Me. Oh, not again, bill. Please listen to me. Bill, I haven't recommended you for the command for a good reason. Now, you're a planner. Your ideas for the commando unit prove that, and we need planners. Besides, general truscott wants a man with combat experience. Sir, there are other qualifications-- it's not my decision. If you want to go over my head, general truscott just flew in from London-- may I have your permission to do just that, sir? Man keeps sticking his neck out... Give me general truscott. Yes, sir. Though I was trained as an artillery officer after I left west point, my real interests was with the raiders of military history, men like Joe Shelby and Jeb Stuart and chief crazy horse and garibaldi. I've studied their campaigns thoroughly. They're guerrilla fighters. The little war-- slash, bleed 'em, and run. I've even thought of a new name. American commandos. No. I think they should have a name all their own. We're not a junior British outfit. Do you remember Robert Rogers in the French-Indian wars? The American rangers. That's a good name. I like it. I've also studied all the operations of the British commandos. They're great, but we can improve on them. I hope you can reach a military objective faster than you're reaching this one. May I ask for your indulgence for a few moments more, sir? The idea of the rangers is to supply a fundamental need. To fight the war in Europe or Africa, we must first get ashore. The marines are committed to the pacific. The army must have a specifically trained, highly skillful force to land. The tip of the javelin, like the British commandos. I know the plans, major. But do you read between the lines, general? Do you read the need for a commander who has lived and breathed and dreamed of exactly this kind of fighting force for years? The rangers are going to be way out in front. In front of them will be their commander. It's going to be a lonely place and a lonely job, and the man there had better be as dedicated as a monk. All that's going to sustain him is faith in his men and faith in himself. And you won't find that by scanning a personnel roster. You'll have to look deep inside the man. No man is as devoted to this idea as I am. General truscott, give me the chance to make our dream live. Saul: When old darbo talked Turkey, not many men could stand up to him. Darby got the job, and we were flown to Scotland, to the town of preswick. A train took US to the British commando depot near dundee. I was the first volunteer enlisted man. The call went out for volunteers to all branches of the American forces in the United Kingdom, and they started for Scotland. All kinds and shapes. Take, for example, sims Delancey. He was a nice irishman but took to fighting like other guys take vitamins-- to give him strength. All right, break it up. Party's over. Gently, soldier, gently. Could've been another battle of bunker hill. You said it, pal. I was about to eat those limeys' hearts out. We lost the battle of bunker hill. You're joshing. What's your name, private? Let's don't get eager. I got a train at midnight. I'm transferring. Here's my orders. What is this ranger business? All volunteers. A real meat grinder outfit. Fight tanks barehanded, swallow bayonets for breakfast. Where you from? Brooklyn. Where you reporting? Scotland. How are the Dodgers doing? I have no idea. I'm a chess man, myself. You're a sick boy. We'll drive you to the station. This is heavy hall. He joined the army to fight and wound up punishing beef. As the English say, the rangers were his dish of tea. This bird Tony sutherland came with a built-in problem. Whenever he saw a woman, he whimpered like a pointer dog in a Meadow full of quail. Sutherland, you have all the moral fiber of a ram goat. Since you've been stationed here, there's been a steady parade of crying women and bellowing husbands. I'm only a homesick g.I... Major, sir. Look, boy, england is a little country. There's just so many women. Why don't you work a new territory? Why not volunteer for this new ranger program in Scotland? How are the Scottish women? Magnificent. And this is Hank bishop. He could do more with cards, chips, and a dame. It's a 65-1 shot against meeting a beauty like you five minutes after I hit London. It's a 100-1 shot. Where do you want to go? I was going to waste time at the red cross club until I catch a train at midnight. Would you be interested in my new plans? You're part of them. You have to take a seat. Newmarket. Hey, you shortchanged her. Please! I'm upset enough without your heckling. This is just my third day. You shortchanged me 2 Bob. Oh, I am sorry. Let me help you. Amazing! Thank you. King's cross coming up, Hank. It's the end of the line. Not for US. I'm afraid it is. I'll see you my first leave. London's a big city. There's lots of pretty girls. I'll play the hand I drew. Major darby, sir? Lieutenant manson, sir, your training officer. This is sergeant mctavish. Sergeant rosen. The car is this way, sir. Where's the transportation for the men? The lorry there for the other ranks. If you don't mind, I'll ride with the other ranks. Got to know them in a hurry. As you wish, sir. Let's move in a little closer, men. He's getting off on the wrong foot. They call it American informality. Are you the C.O., sir? That's right. We'll get acquainted later. I only have one thing to say-- get along with the British. They're going to train US. We'll be attached to the first commando brigade and subject to their discipline and regulations. You mean we'll be taking orders from the limeys? As of this moment, the British commandos are probably the finest fighting troops in the world. In time, we will be. All right. Let's move into the trucks. Parade! Parade, attention! Stand easy. Gentlemen, my name is lieutenant manson. I shall be your training officer. I am, by nature, cruel and vicious. In time, you shall want very badly to kill me. You'll pray that a fatal accident befalls me. It will not happen. I'll live on to train you and make your life a living inferno. I shall do everything you do, except I shall do it infinitely better. Purpose? To mold you into fighting men. It is said that one American could defeat five of any other nationality. Here, you will learn the fallacy of that concept. Bawk bwk bwk bwk. Your training will be more than flesh can endure. Those of you who cannot endure it may bid US farewell, and we couldn't care less. For the time being, I'll mention only these specifics. Military discipline and courtesy will be ruthlessly enforced. Food will be quite dull after your lavish American rations. To begin the process of physical conditioning, you'll march on the double at all times-- formations, mess, and if you're on sick call, you'll double-time to hospital. Well, that's all for now. I have an announcement to make about quarters. Due to a shortage of barracks space, you will be temporarily billeted in private homes in dundee. Yay! Yay! Ha ha ha! It'll be happy hunting for me! That was a good speech of manson's. I liked it. I hear on a commando raid, he cut three Jerry throats. A very hairy gentleman, indeed. You remember we're one man short? Yeah. Burns. The straggler just showed up. Drunk? Young. You want to see him? Yes. I want to know them all personally. One straggler coming up. Private rollo burns reporting, sir. Reporting late. Yes, sir. 13 hours. I got mixed up in London. I went from Victoria station-- never mind the tour. Why'd you volunteer for the rangers, soldier? Well, since I'm in the army, I just wanted to be the best. Mm-hmm. I didn't hurt you, did I, sir? I'll get a thorough checkup by the doctor. Ok. That's all. Report back to your section leader. Yes, sir. That grenade must've been a dud, huh, sir? That's right, it was a dud... Sir. They gave me this address where I'm supposed to live. Can you tell me how to get there? I can. Take a bus on the high road yonder to city square. Number 5 tram to cavendish Lane. Fourth house on the corner. You knock on the door, a pretty girl of 19 will answer. Thanks a lot. How do you do? Uh...i guess this is the right address. I'm supposed to live with you. To live with me? You must be pulling my leg. It says right here. The army sent me. Oh, the billeting office. I understand. You don't live alone, do you? No. I live with my father. I wonder if he knows about this? [Irish accent] I sure hope so. I sure hope so. Must be kind of a surprise to see a soldier living in your house. No. I think it's rather nice. Come in. You have a nice house. You want to see your bedroom? Anybody else home? No. We're all alone. Come on. Well, how do you like it? Oh, it's fine. Just fine. I'll bet this is the first time you've ever been in a bedroom with a woman alone. Isn't it? I wouldn't be too sure about that. How about you? I've had my in'ins. How old are you? Age has nothing to do with the secrets of a woman's heart. And how old is that? My, you are callow, aren't you? I think it's cute to see a man so inexperienced. I've had some experience. Really? Where? In San Carlos, Arizona. Oh, the wild and woolly west, eh? I suppose you fought the Indians, too. Yeah. I've, uh... Fought a few. You yanks do shoot a line. You asked me, and I told you. I had fought Indians. Apache Indians, too. Really? I thought the Indians were all civilized now. The fighting just happened in the flicks, in the movies. Oh. I fought the son of a mescalero chief once. Name was yellow calf. It was bloody. Did you win? I didn't have a chance. But your hair. He didn't scalp you? We were raised together on the reservation. You're really terribly clever. Ok, madam pompadour, are we through shooting lines? You really like your room? Oh, yeah. I think it's great. I never had anything like this before in the army. And a real double bed. With real down. Feel it. Hey! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Hey. Hey, can you bounce? Hey. It's a hay ride. Hey! Daddy, I didn't expect you home so soon. I... Found the house ok, sarge. [Knock knock] Mr. Andrews? Correct, sir. My name is Tony sutherland. I suppose I'm going to live with you. Oh, aye. Of course. Do come in, Mr. Sutherland. I was just leaving. I, uh... I'm with the home guards. Sheilah, dearest. This is my wife Mrs. Andrews. Darling, this is Mr. Sutherland, sent to US by the billeting office. How do you do? Well, I sure am glad to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Andrews. I must apologize for running off like this, Mr. Sutherland, but duty calls. Two nights a week, I'm a soldier. I'll try to be home early. Make yourself comfortable, Mr. Sutherland. Good-bye. Sure do hope I don't cause you no trouble, Mrs. Andrews. I'm sure you won't be any trouble at all. What I mean to say is, all I want to do is fit right in without causing no trouble... Just like as if I was one of the family. You're welcome here. Thank you, ma'am. M-M-My husband teaches archaeology at the university. Oh. Well, that must be real exciting. He's a good man. Well, that's real nice, Mrs. Andrews. Well, he is. Well, I said... That's very nice. The commandos put the whip to US with no time wasted. At first, we cried out hearts out. But it fixed nothing, so we buckled down. Lieutenant manson did the honors. It didn't take long to separate the boys from the men. Over 3,000 men volunteered. The first battalion kept 450. As long I live, I'll never forget manson's favorite expression. Get off your bloody knees, yanks! Let's get cracking! Do they give a purple heart for a rupture? With a cluster. I may send my hair out to be dry cleaned. Aim for the rump, you chumps! I hope that machine gunner don't get the hiccups. [Explosion] Here they are. Hit the dirt! Hey, they're shooting real bullets. Yeah. I may bleed real blood. Are we still in Scotland? Mmm, boy, howdy. That should shake up their livers. With a cluster. Well, it finally came through. What we've all been waiting for. What finally came? The new table of organizations. It's been approved by general Beckman. The boys will be happy. 6 first sergeants, 28 staffs, 40 bucks. Plenty of promotions, sir. File it. Beg your pardon, sir? File it. There'll be no promotions till after we finish training. The stripes will be something to shoot for. Yes, sir. I suppose you're right, colonel. Colonel? Oh, I forgot to tell you. Your promotion came through. Mazel tov. I don't understand. The war department figured you should carry more weight. Oh, yeah. I... Took the Liberty of buying you your new leaves. That's very nice of you, Saul. You're welcome, sir. Will that be all? You're getting to be a cagey old poop, aren't you? Give me those promotions. I'll think about them. Let's see how the boys do in training phase two. Why'd we have to move out of those nice, warm civilian homes? 'Cause we're rangers. We need toughening. I'd hate to get too tough. Closing that px was a cruel blow. Those milky way bars kept me alive with this English chow. My little cub scouts bedded down warm and comfy? Go back to your warm hole, you dog robber. You can listen to US coughing up our pneumonia. Probably got some warm hut, you and the skipper. Old darbo, where's he? Here I am, private. I didn't mean exactly that you were... That's all right, heavy. How you men doing? I don't mind sleeping out, but I hate scrounging for my bedding. Finding a bed has never been a problem to you before. Sure ain't, colonel. Where are you staying tonight, colonel? Sergeant rosen found US a good spot to sleep-- a pigpen. Being a hero's harder than I thought it'd be. Night. Good night. Is it true the colonel gave away his Jeep? Yeah. And it's killing me. Oy vey. Guess the colonel knows all about my activities. Sure do feel sorry for that nice Mrs. Andrews, me being out of circulation the way I am. And nice Mr. Andrews out guarding the empire all night. She don't care nothing about me not having a class "a" uniform and being a mite muddy. Why don't you leave that woman alone? Yeah. She's kind of a dog. Oh, man! Hey, you guys cover for me if there's a bed check. [Knocking on door] Tony, what... I couldn't wait to see you. You shouldn't be here. You don't want me out in that rainy night. What if John came? What'll he do, shoot US? He's too nice a man. Oh, Tony, go away. You don't mean that. Right now your heart's beating like a little ol' slush pup. Oh, Tony, don't. Please. Please! You awake? Nice of you to wait up for me, Eli. You curious? Sutherland... If you go near that woman again, I'll kill you. You ain't got nothing to worry about. Just another page in my book of memories. A man once said I had the moral fiber of a goat. Themachers-- the big boys-- decided it was time for a spot of relaxation. Three-day passes for everybody. The boys were casual about it and waited their turn in true gentlemanly fashion. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Passes! Aah! Aah! Ah, you English beauties, hoist a small craft warning. Delancey's blowing up a Gale. I may share myself with as many as three broads. Hey, taxi! You sure you got it straight? It's the swankiest trap in town. Dinner at 9:00. Eck-chay. You don't want my gal to get you some dates? Uh-uh. No blind dates. Too many dogs that way. There's a million tomatoes here. We can't get two, they'd drum US out of the rangers. I'll see you later. So long, buddy. London, brace yourself. Boys, I want you to meet Wendy Hollister. This is heavy hall, sims Delancey. How do you do? What happened to your girls? Oh, we decided to stag it up. My buddy plays with the truth. We drew the collar. I beg your pardon? It's a baseball expression. It means we knocked our brains out and came up with each other. Yes. We spread ourselves too thin. Honey, you must know some girls. Maybe there's some at the garage. Garage? Oh, thanks, but let it go. I could try. No, forget it, Wendy. We're having a ball. Don't bother. They're probably busy draining a crankcase, and they'd be real slippery or something. Yeah. Go ahead, sweetie, make a couple calls. I'll order up a couple steaks, two inches thick, charcoal black on the outside and red on the inside. Ok? Well, sit down. Haven't you ever seen a dame before? Look, old buddy, ain't we suffered enough, you got to twist the knife? I wonder what kennel she'll call. What's this? A nice piece of haddock, sir. You'll find it quite tasty. What's your favorite kind of dog? I like spaniels. I prefer the bigger breeds, like Saint bernards. Here are the girls. Girls, I want you to meet a couple of dog lovers. I'm up here, you know. [Whistling] It's a nice moonlight night. It's a bomber's moon. No. They won't come tonight. I'll give even money. I'll bet you sixpence. It's a bet. Say, I wonder where we can get a nightcap. I can give you some tea. I've been thinking of just that all night. Here's a taxi. [Whistles] Hey, you do that better than a man. I do a lot of things better than a man. It's a bit shabby. I was blitzed out of my nice flat last week. Looks like the Waldorf after sacking in the mud. I'll just put the kettle on. How long has it been since you were alone with a girl? About 48 hours. Glad you're not letting down the American tradition. I hold up my end. I'll bet you do. [Air raid siren] You owe me sixpence. Maybe it's a false alarm. Not likely. Have to turn the gas off. Oh, I'm so fed up with these bloody raids. [Rumbling] Here they come. [Bomb whistling] I'm sorry about the tea. [Explosion] Hank... Sit down. Here. Shouldn't we go to the cellar? You're a gambler. The odds are great a bomb won't fall on US. The long shot could clean out the whole house. [Explosion] Sit down. There's no use being nervy in an air raid. The only thing is to pretend it isn't going on. Look. [Bomb whistling] Better? I'm beginning to get my nerve back. [Explosion] Who were you with in the last 48 hours? Nobody. I've been like a monk. Well, I'm glad. Oh, darling. [Explosions] [Whistling] "Dearest dealer from Reno, "I promised you a cup of tea, and you shall have it, "provided you make it yourself. "I've gone to shop for our breakfast "and will return at maximum speed. Adoringly yours, Wendy." Good morning! It's a beautiful morning, but it will probably rain tonight. That will mean no air raid. You'll be getting several handsome rashers of bacon. We'll have breakfast quickly. I love you madly. Hey, hold the phone. I think I lost a vertebra last night. I have our day all planned. So have I. Don't do that, or we'll never get breakfast. We're going to the country. You can bet me. Then we'll get off the train, and we'll walk in some lovely fields. Fields of... Lovely...Love-- Wow, that's quite a house. It is rather nice, isn't it? Wonder who lives there. I do. You do? Well, how come? I mean, you're not one of those ladies, are you? I should hope so. I mean, lady somebody or another. No, I'm not lady somebody, but I'm afraid my father is sir somebody. I thought you worked on a bus. I do. Come on. You'll like them. I hope you like our English tea. The best cup I ever had last night. [Clattering] Be wise not to cultivate the habit, young man-- chocked full of dangerous chemicals. It accounts for our decline as a world power. Where did you two meet, at a service club? No, ma'am. We met on her bus. Confounded bus. No place for a woman. Riding a bus wouldn't give you much time to become acquainted. It didn't take much time, about two hours. Hank, we have a very interesting greenhouse. My father grows rubber plants. You said you were interested in rubber plants. I did? Ohh. Oh, yeah. Sure. I'll join you soon, after I help mother clear the table. The answer to your question is... He's the man I'm going to marry. Only he doesn't know it yet. You've only just met him, but you love him, and no matter what we say, you're determined to marry him? That, roughly, is the situation. You have my blessing. Arthur, how can you be so casual? We know nothing about him. Who is he? Where does he come from? What does he do? He's an American soldier. He comes from america. He soldiers. Mother, i'm terribly in love. It's never happened to me before. And as they say in the theater, "nothing else matters." Oh, my dear. Consider the difference in your backgrounds. There's a vast Gulf between his world and yours. We'll build a bridge. Arthur, you don't seem to understand. She's talking about marriage. With that bloom on her cheek, I should hope so. Hank? What did they have to say? It's not so much what they said. It's what I said. Yeah. Well, what did you say? Just that I was in love with you. Love. You dames sure work that word to death. Don't we, though? The odds against you really loving me are about 13-5. I'll bet you another sixpence. What did your mother say then? She mentioned something about the difference in our backgrounds. Oh, she's so right, Wendy. Look, I punched cows one summer. There's one thing they're very careful about. They always kept the range scrubs away from the thoroughbreds. Are you calling me a cow, Hank? I think you've blown your gasket. Temper, temper. Ah, I thought that card would never show up. Rummy. 22. 18. 22, 18... And 7. And 7. Your deal. My heavens, your dexterity with cards is most interesting. Mr. Bishop... Wendy tells US that you're planning to be married. What do you think of the idea, Mrs. Hollister? I wish we knew something more about you. What do you want to know? Well, naturally, any mother would like to be sure that her daughter is marrying a good man. It depends on what you mean by good. I can only tell you I've been in jail. When I was a kid, I ran away with a man's car. I got six months in the can. I handle cards good, Mr. Hollister, because i'm a professional gambler. I'm a dealer at Reno. A croupier! There hasn't been one in the family since cousin hortense was ruined by the chap from monte Carlo. Oh, shh. Dug coal for a living, got my brains knocked out fighting in the ring, shipped out as an ordinary seaman. I hoboed across the country. I drink quite a bit when I can. I don't believe in saving money. Does that answer your question, Mrs. Hollister? Anything else youwant to know, Mr. Hollister? You'll find I don't shock quite so easily, Mr. Bishop. I've hoboed a bit in my day, too. No. I'm not particularly worried. You see, I don't think you want to get married, and, if you should, well... Wendy's the one who must judge you. She's reached the age of consent. If by now she cannot Gauge the worth of another human being, then I've raised a foolish girl. Your deal. The next time you're thinking about marriage, let the man in on the plans. I was going to. You didn't level with me. That's one thing that steams me-- the little bus conductor living in a castle. It's not a castle. And you're no fairy Princess, as far as I'm concerned. You set a lousy trap. I didn't have to drop bread crumbs behind me to get out of that. Hank? I'll see you soon? Not as long as those wedding bells keep clanging around in your pretty little head. The rangers started climbing. It was dizzy, dirty, and dangerous. [Whistles] Dear, don't you think we should talk about it? Do... Do you love him? I've tried, John. I've tried so hard. No more shoes in my face. "Sheila, I am giving you your freedom. "I suppose the difference in our ages "was always too great. "I will go to London and try for a position at the university." May I speak to Tony sutherland? Is he here? He's dead. Oh! He had a big, long fall. What am I going to do? You made your bed, lass. ♪ Commandos tried to make it rough ♪ ♪ but they couldn't make it tough enough ♪ ♪ darby's rangers ♪ rugged rangers ♪ we love our women hot and strong ♪ ♪ we're weaned on booze and lusty song ♪ ♪ darby's rangers ♪ lusty rangers ♪ Very smart. I want you to know you've done a fine job training our men. They're in good shape. They'll be good soldiers, colonel. I suppose an officer's first wartime command is always the one he remembers the best. I'm sure you'll be proud of them, sir. I'm sure. Good evening, Saul. Boy, what an evening, huh? We didn't see many like this in colts neck, New Jersey. Well, we had them in Arkansas. I remember when I was a kid on a farm outside fort Smith... Air was clear, like this. You could hear the train coming from a long way off. I'd run down to the tracks and put my ear to the rail. Pretty soon, it would start singing. It'd get louder and louder until the ground shook... Like the end of the world coming. Colonel? Yes, Saul? When do we go to war? We move out in 48 hours. Do you know what the time is, soldier? It's half past 11:00. I'll not have my daughter kept out till these sinful hours. W-W-Would you please stand up? Eh? For what? I have an announcement to make. It would be better if you stood up. It all sounds very melodramatic. Well? I'm in love with your daughter. If I come out of the war, we'll marry. If you want to fight, that's ok. Oh, is that so? You mean that, do you? You'd fight for her? Any time. Then why didn't you tell me so a month ago? I just wanted a man for a son-in-law. I've got something for the occasion. A drop by king James ii. None of your wartime hooch. Yeah. 'Tis 25-year-old whiskey. It falls on the tongue like the tiptoeing of an angel. And that's for me. Here's to your happiness, my children. And may you be blessed with many bairns. Well, what's bairns? Children. [Coughing] Ha ha ha. You shouldn't have come all the way up here. It was intuition. I had a feeling you were leaving. I wanted to see you, too, but I saw what happened in Reno. Well, you want a wedding ring. Have I asked? There's a pool where all the divorced women throw their rings. There's enough gold in the bottom to pave the Lincoln highway. I watched those poor broads, lonely and miserable, trying to make like it was all happy and very gay. No. The odds are just too high against marriage. You keep talking about marriage, Hank. You must have it on your mind. I'll always remember you, Wendy. You'll do more than that, Hank. You'll come back to me. You'll not find a better woman than I am, so you'll be back. All right, men, let's go! Fall in! Good hunting, boy. We'll prang them good for you, lieutenant. Saul: All right, men, let's go! Fall in! Take good care of her, sarge. Keep your backside down, laddie. That's the way we left Scotland. The rangers will always have a special place in their hearts for dundee. I remember an old scotsman I used to drink beer with. When I left, he said, "mit glick." That means "good luck" in Jewish. I thought it was nice of the old boy. Although we didn't know it, we were pointed at a place called arzeu, north Africa. At 1:30 in the morning on November 8, 1942, we slipped ashore and caught the enemy in the middle of a lullaby. We picked them off cool, quick, and quiet. Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Now? Now. We cleared the way for ships to enter the harbor and move inland. In the battle of north Africa, the allies captured 130,000 German troops, 6,200 artillery pieces, 2,550 German tanks, and their song, lili Marlene. The troops and the song's lyrics were both dirtied in the process. When the campaign was over, we trained two more battalions and headed for Europe's soft underbelly. First stop was the port of gela in sicily. We spearheaded. Rangers, let's tear up a little real estate! [Speaking Italian] You ok, kid? And a word of greeting to the American rangers. Don't get captured, Chicago gangsters. You will be shot. We're made. Sergeant? Yeah? Sergeant! Yes, sir. Isn't it customary in the rangers to stand in an officer's presence? I'm standing, lieutenant. I'm lieutenant dittman. Yes, sir. If you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the battalion commander. Sir, this is lieutenant dittman, the new replacement for lieutenant Williamson in baker company. Glad to have you with US, dittman. Thank you, sir. What was your class at the point, lieutenant? Class of '42, sir. Of course this is your first combat assignment. Yes, sir, but my 201 file will show you I was 5th in my class. That's fine. Sit down, lieutenant. A new officer, especially a west point man, will have some adjusting to do with the rangers. See, we're kind of a mustang outfit. We use the book, but occasionally, a page or two gets mislaid. I understand, sir. You're replacing a good man. I had to write a letter to his mother. I have only one ambition in this war-- to write as few of those letters as possible. From a purely military standpoint-- ahem... No, thank you, sir. Rangers are too valuable to die. They're specialists, dittman, expert technicians... In the art of killing without being killed. As such... They should be treated as you would treat a master craftsman... With dignity and honor. And with discipline? Intelligent discipline... Respectful discipline. I'm sorry I can't give you something more exciting. You'll get to know the outfit quicker if you take over as officer of the day. Very good, sir. Where is the sergeant of the guard? Where is the sergeant of the guard? He wasn't feeling too well. What's wrong with him? He killed his first man. It upset him. Did he report on sick call? I don't think so, sir. Let's find him. Which is he? Right there, sir. Excuse me, sir. What excuse do you have for not reporting for duty? None, sir. They tell me you're upset because you killed a man in action. Is that it? I don't know, sir. You'd better find out. Yes, sir. To kill an enemy of your country is something to be proud of. Yes, sir. Shall we mount the guard, sir? I'd like to meet that guy some night on flirtation walk... Alone. Pow! Shame on you. He's our fearless leader. He's the boy going to lead US through shot and shell. Oh, the chicken factory is turning them out very ripe these days. If you boys don't mind. Relax. Mind if I take it easy for a minute? N-N-No, sir. Sit down. Cigarette? No. Thank you, sir. What did it feel like? When you killed the Italian? He just looked at me. He didn't want to die. I've killed men, too. It won't be the last for either one of US. Sir? Well, I was brought up to believe that a man's life was sacred and only god had the right to take it. I believe that... Unless he's trying to kill you first. Well, I'll get over it, I guess. Of course you will. Boy, look... We didn't make this world, so we can't account for the kind of men that are in it. All we can do as soldiers is try and repair it so it can be lived in again. Unfortunately, that means killing. Well... Why that little Italian? Now, he was just an ordinary guy. Probably was... But he stood for evil. You know, I think war is a big stink. A big stink. There never was a good war... Or an intelligent or kind one. Rollo... We'll be haunted by the men we've killed as long as we live... But when you marry Peggy and... You look in the faces of your children, you'll understand why it had to be done. Sir? Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. I was talking to myself, too. Sicily wrapped up in 38 days. Three weeks later, we established a sorrento peninsula beachhead and held it for 22 days. Then we led the 5th army attack up the boot. Then on October 2, 1943, it came. Hey! There it is! "See Naples and die," the old saying goes, but a lot of good rangers died and never did get to see it. Hey, Hank! They say the Italians invented women! A very useful invention! I hear the streetwalkers have taken over the town! I couldn't care less. I'm going to the museum! Ha ha ha! Come on. Hee hee hee! Hee hee hee! Hee hee hee! I have changed mind. I do not care for the dust. Everybody gets deloused. But the tube is improper. It's a military government order. Want to catch typhus? I will not! I will not! Come here. [Yelling in Italian] [Yelling in Italian] Just a minute, sergeant. Sergeant! Let me talk to her. I think I can persuade her. She's going to get blown one way or the other. She'll cooperate. Come on now. Look, miss, let me explain. There's been quite a few cases of typhus reported, so this dusting is a precaution. You know typhus has killed more people in wars than bullets? I understand. It is only that the method is immodest. Privacy is impossible in a situation like this. Why? Well, it, uh... It just is. That's all. Pl-pl-please, miss. Let's be cooperative, huh? You are very kind, lieutenant. I will make a bargain. I will allow myself to have the dust... If you operate the machine yourself, personally. Me? Ma'am, i-- Angelina. Angelina de lotta. I don't know how to operate the machine. But we will help each other, no? Excuse me, ma'am. Sergeant, this young lady says she'll submit if, uh, if I do the dusting. What's the matter? I ain't got enough rank for her? It's not that. It's just that, uh, she's kind of modest. All right. Here you are. Dust your head off. Next these people will want a three-star general delouse. Go ahead, lieutenant. Press the trigger. Now in the back now. Thank you. Ha ha ha! You are a fine gentleman, lieutenant. I have gratitude for you. Well, it wasn't anything. I just figured-- may I show my thanks to you? How? I will cook you a dinner in my apartment. Your apartment, huh? By candlelight, I presume? If you wish. The electric is back. I don't mind, baby. I'm loaded. Come. I'm hungry. Hey, lieutenant. Hey, lieutenant. How about that? Three hours in town and he scores. He's in like a porcupine with her. A shavetail. Ha ha ha! So... We are ready. Please, to seat me? Huh? We must be very elegant. Oh. Would, uh... Would 1,000 lira cover everything? You know? For the meal? But you are my guest. Besides, it is a simple meal. It would cost perhaps 100 lira... 50. In america, when you are invited, do you offer to pay for the food? Oh. I get you. I am the first Italian girl you meet? So far. I'm sorry for the bad coffee. I think it's mostly barley. Very good. The whole meal was excellent. You are most kind. You are cute. Cute. Uh... Bello. Very pretty. Thank you. Look, I got about 1,500 lira. I do not understand. 1,750. That's as high as I can go. You mean, for dinner? No. I mean for everything. Lieutenant dittman... I speak good English for a nonanglo, no? Excellent. I learn at the university of napoli. Is that so? I'm graduated. My father worked for the government. He was an expert in custom taxes at the harbor. A small official, but an honest one. He was killed four months ago in a bombing. Our home was destroyed. My hope is to get a job with your army... As translator. I'm sorry for what I said. No, you are not. You are too stupid to be sorry. If you weren't, you'd be able to tell between a working girl and a prostitute on the streets. Angelina, please forgive me. You cannot buy everything with money, soldier, even in a country you conquer. Yeah. You're right. I am stupid... But it's all new to me. I didn't mean to hurt you. Good night, lieutenant. Look-- go! Leave my home! The war cheapens everything... Especially somesoldiers. Start packing up. We're moving out. May I speak with the colonel? All right, but hurry. It will only take a moment. What is it? Would the colonel know someone in military government? Amg? I might. Why. Well, I'm indebted to an Italian girl. She wants a job as a translator. That's quite a repayment. Must be some debt. Well, she taught me a lot. Well, I mean I learned a lot. Well, I insulted her, and she's a good girl. A situation not covered in the handbook, huh? I'll see what I can do. Thank you very much, sir. It's all set, lieutenant! Thanks a lot, colonel. If you were a general and had your choice of any European country to defend, you'd pick Italy. The jerries retreated from one mountain range to another, and all the time, those 88s were down our throat. Is the guard any bigger? About the same. Then let's get at it. Too much activity going on, laughing and talking too much. Well, maybe they're drunk. It's a good time to hit 'em. Maybe they're being relieved. It would account for the laughing. Let's go. Think about it, lieutenant. I have. Dittman's got that glory look. He ain't heard from that Italian broad. He's gone off his rocker. They're behind US! The Jerry relief. We're boxed in. I'd say it's time to run. Ok, fall back! Let's get him somewhere to stop the bleeding. Get them back! I'll cover! Leave me your ammo. Bishop, get these men back, every one of them, or I'll kill you! The chowderhead got you into it, didn't he? Come on, you guys! Move! He's liable to get hurt. Want to help him? Yeah, I feel guilty. I haven't earned that $10-a-month combat pay. Let's go. I told you to get those men back. If they get lost, they'll send up smoke signals. I hope I get a little discipline in this outfit. Let's leapfrog, lieutenant. Go! Come on, lieutenant! Come on! Go! Go! Go ahead, bishop! Beat it! Let's jazz up the situation a little. Delancey, pass the ammo! Come on! Come on! Great idea. How'd you think of it? How do you think I made lieutenant? We sat on our behinds while winter ended. Spring came, then summer, then early fall, and we were still on our behinds, this time in the mud. How's it going, Delancey? Can't complain, colonel. Most people have to pay for mud baths. I'm afraid if I quit bailing, this hole's going to sink. Hello, Eli. What's the word? I never thought I'd see the day when I'd want to march. I understand. Any sign of relief, colonel? [Imitating frog] Help me get these men out of here. Will you speak to the general? It wouldn't do any good. There's simply not the replacements. We'll take the positions for you, but why should we have to hold them when any outfit could do the same job. Nobody likes this mountain fighting. They all want relief. I'm not asking for relief from battle. Just let US do the job we were trained for. Somebody's got to do the dirty work. Fine. Take elite troops with better spirit than any other soldiers in Italy, troops I've made into the edge of a razor, and make them shovel mud. That's high-Echelon brains. That remark was uncalled for. It's time somebody called for something. My men are through being groundhogs. If the general doesn't relieve those men, I'll go over his head. I'll go to Mark Clark. And throw away your career? I don't give a damn. Where's my Jeep? Down the hill. Colonel. Colonel. Look, colonel, simmer down. Don't start trouble with a general. If I'm not back by sundown, forward my mail to the Pentagon, 'cause I'll be fighting it there That's my boy. Don't ask me how we got out of the mountains. I suspected a little of El darbo's black magic. Anyway, the general cut the orders. Naples was a doll... A beautiful doll. Che alla pórta? It's me, Arnold... Arnold dittman. Let me in. Go away. Angelina, I've got to see you. Open the door. Please, Angie. If you don't open the door, I'm going to break it down. Are you sick? A little bit sick. Who's taking care of you? I have a doctor. Angie, I nearly went crazy these last six weeks when you didn't write. I have the job of translator. You are very kind to get it for me. You see... Well, I know now... I'm in love with you. Don't say that. I'm sure, Angie. For the first time in my life, I'm sure. No. Oh, no. What's the matter? You in pain? Huh? You are still a stupid little boy. You want to know why I don't write to you? Stand over there... Away. Do what I say. Away. You asked to see. I show you. You are satisfied? [Door opens and shuts] [Stumbling] Just tell him. Sir... I resign my commission. Get up, lieutenant. Sir, Angelina's going to have a baby. She's going to have a baby, sir. I want to resign my commission. What is it, colonel? An officer and a gentleman, by act of congress. Ohh. Ugh... How do you feel now? Better, I think. You ready to talk? I guess so, sir. Then sit down and listen. Let's forget we're in the army for a few minutes, and I'll try to talk to you like a father. I just came from Angelina's. We had a long talk. Are you listening? I don't-- sit down. You think life is a well-ordered drill field? Now, listen. Angelina told me all about it. The father of the child is dead. He was a partisan fighter executed by the Germans. They were engaged to be married. I'm not saying what she did was right, but she was in love with him. That's dandy. Love makes all the difference, of course. Why don't you grow up? The army's paying you to be an officer and a man. Try acting like one. That poor girl's gone through more than you could even dream of. Before deciding to walk away from her for good, you'd better give it a good, long think. What a mess. A big one, and it will take a big man to handle it. Can you do it? Forgiveness can't be requisitioned from a supply depot, you know. She has to have help. I think she's pretty sick. Can I borrow your Jeep, sir? [Engine starts] Rosen's warming it up for you now. How is she? Li parli italiano? No. She...very sick. Bad kidney. Sulfur...no good. She need very much... La penicillina. Penicillin? Si, si. You wait here? Ok. Sorry. The penicillin supply's very limited. She's very sick. She might die. Sorry, lieutenant. There must be some way. Only for military personnel. In an extreme case, maybe their dependents. [Speaking Italian] You are catholic? Yes, yes. [Speaking Italian] Hurry. Just marry US. Tell him her life depends on it. [Door opens] Hello, heavy. I thought you guys came to see me. I ain't going to have a baby. Just good living. Please. A little respect for motherhood. What's the fuss? The odds it'll be a boy are 6-5. [Door opens] Your wife will be ok, but we couldn't save the baby. We don't have facilities for premature babies. Can I see her now? She's pretty well knocked out. You'd better wait till tomorrow. The lieutenant won't be here tomorrow. We're going back in the real estate business. Keep your seasick pills handy. I got to get out of here. You can go in, but she'll still be asleep. Angie. The baby is gone. We'll have more... Lots of babies... Because you're my wife... And I love you so much. Angie... I think I'll make a pretty fair husband, too, now. I've grown about 2 inches taller in the last couple of days. [Mumbling in Italian] Shh. Go to sleep. The mountains were too tough, so the big brass decided on an amphibious landing higher up. For the fourth time, the rangers were picked to raise the curtain. Sergeant. Yeah? I want to change the beneficiary of my gi insurance. Ok, lieutenant. Who do you want me to change it to? To my wife... Mrs. Angelina dittman. Anzio was a beach resort in civilian life, quiet and peaceful. The hun soon changed that. The landing took Jerry by surprise, all right, but he soon rallied and poured in everything. It turned out to be a hell of a mess. [Playing imaginary flute] Aren't you ever scared? Sure I'm scared. This is my way of crying. [Car approaches] Cisterna sits astride highway 7. The beachhead can't be expanded... Until this town is taken. We'll take it with an infiltrating attack, fast and shocking. Intelligence reports the area in front of cisterna is held by a thin line of scattered outposts. Now, 1st and 3rd battalions will jump off at 01:00 hours. You will filter through the enemy under strict radio silence, which will last until 07:00. Remember this-- while infiltrating... You'll avoid a fight under any circumstances. The 4th will follow an hour later and link up with the 1st and 3rd in cisterna. And that's about it. Good luck. Back to our type action, eh, colonel? I hope so. I just hope so. Sounds like routine. Maybe. I heard it last night, Saul. Heard what, sir? It was the nightmare. I was a boy back in Arkansas listening to the train on the rails. Suddenly, it got louder and louder, and... I looked up, and the train was right there, coming at me. I couldn't move. Then you woke up? Yeah. It's just a dream. Sure. This ought to be our cup of tea... Exactly the type action we were trained for. Remember... Back in dundee? [Loud engine approaches] They should be halfway there by now. Well, I'll be damned. [Makes bird call] We're 800 yards south of cisterna. We're being hit from all sides. It's a big-scale offensive. You'll have to hang on. Dig in. The 4th battalion will attack. Let's move. This was the low, clinging kind of fog I used to see when I was hunting duck out on long island. Now I know how the duck felt. Uhh! Ohh! Uhh! Uhh! It was awful laying out there in that fog, seeing nothing and hearing everything. We couldn't get through. There was a solid line of German fire between US and the trapped 1st and 3rd battalions. This is big bruiser. They're zeroing in on US. We're trying to get through. Hang on. We're hanging on by our eyelashes now. How do you feel? How do you think I feel? Lousy. I'm dying. You're too ugly to die young. [Loud engine approaches] I'm out of ammo! So am I. We can't get through. Tell your men to filter back as best they can. I'm sorry, dittman. We'll do what we can. Let's get out of here. Let's go. He's dead. Hello, pickerel 4. Hello, pickerel 4. This is big bruiser. Over. Hello, pickerel 4. Hello, pickerel 4. This is big bruiser. Over. It's no use, colonel. Darby's nightmare came true. It was the end of his world. Any rangers? Not yet, sir. Medic, take care of this man. Are you all right? Sure. Mctavish never thought I'd make a soldier. [Cough cough] Wait till I tell him how many I got last night. Colonel, here's Hank and heavy. Rough night out, sir. How's rollo? I can't do nothing for this guy. He's dead. And that's the way the rangers died-- without a whimper, there at anzio, in the soft underbelly of Europe. But the few that lived could always be proud, for what they ran into that night wasn't an ambush. It was a fully-mounted offensive. The cream of the German army-- the hermann goering panzer division. They pinned medals on US and said that if we hadn't smashed the German push, they'd have thrown the allies back into the sea. Maybe so. I don't know. Anyway, the tip of the javelin was broken, so the rangers were disbanded and shipped home. How many do you want? Oh, I'm going to play these. Wendy? One. One. Dealer takes one. What have you got? Full house. Wendy? Two pair. I have a seven and... Four aces. You wouldn't cold deck somebody in your own family? I'm just getting in practice for the visiting suckers. Your deal, Wendy. And young dittman went back to his future. Hello, Mrs. Dittman. Hello, my husband. The big man of the rangers-- colonel William Orlando darby-- was ordered back to the Pentagon for reassignment. I drove him to the beach that morning to grab a ride to Naples. I'll take it. Thought i'd walk you down. No, this is one walk I'll take alone. Good-bye, Saul. So long, bill. Hey, look at that ranger patch.
