If Baldwin gets the money out of that board of directors today, he's apt to add on twenty stories. Take this up to the foreman's office, will you? Do you think he's got a chance of getting it, Mr. Gibson? If he does it's a miracle. But then, Baldwin's been dealing in miracles for that last three years. Hm, here he is, and smiling. - Well, what happened? - Well, we did it! Good, but you don't have to slug me, I'm not one of your directors. Come on, let's go as high as we can, I feel like sitting on top of the world. Come on, let's go. It looks as though there are twenty more stories, we're going on. Morty! Fine. Thank you. Well, how was the meeting? Well, you know what a directors' table looks like, Link. Twenty Draculas and a couple of Frankensteins. And yet do you sell them. Do you mind casting aside your natural modesty and telling me how you did it? Oh, what's the difference how I did it, it's done, boy. Oh, come on, tell me. Well, I simply told them that we weren't building it for them, we were building it for the next generation and the one after that. Hm, you've got plenty of nerve. I told them we were putting so much money in it... ...and building it so high that no bank in the world would ever dare tear it down. - Were there any objections to all this? - Plenty. Kaplan held out till the end. I finally reminded him that I held his note in an enterprise that was about to collapse. - And? - Kaplan collapsed. This is for Mr. Baldwin and party. Okay, get in. Morty! - Mattie! Mattie! - Yes, sir? Mattie, what's the matter with the service around here? I'm sorry, Mr. Baldwin, but I was busy in the kitchen. You were, well, the only way you can square yourself with me... ...is to get me a nice, big high one with a lot of ice. Yes, sir. - Oh, Natalie! Natalie! - Is that you, Larry? Well, who did you expect? Idiot. - What are you doing? - Looking at what we've accomplished. "We". What "we've" accomplished. - Counting me in again, hm? - Why, certainly. There never would have been a Baldwin Building if it hadn't been for you. Silly. You know, I get tired just thinking of all the work you put into that building. You look tired. It think it's been the hardest day I've had this season. I'm dead. Say, you've been telling me that for years. There's no point in you tiring yourself all out, you'd better slow up a bit. You should tell me to slow up. After the way you've been slaving? How did the board meeting go? - Fine. Say, you were right about Kaplan. - Was I? Yeah. When I reminded him that I held his note, he folded up. - I just had a hunch. - I wonder what I'd do without your hunches. Takes intelligence to know the good ones from the bad. Oh, you flatterer, you. Eight months more our building will be finished. - We won our fight. - You won your fight. We! Every time I holler across the directors' table, you're right there. Where? Any place else? Oh, my sweet. You know, a funny thing happened today. - I ran across Link. - Hm? He started pinning me down asking questions. Said he'd noticed a remarkable change in me in the past three years. - Link's a dear. - Said he wondered what had awakened me. What had given me this new ambition. Wouldn't it be funny if he knew the answer? - Don't say it. - I will. Three years ago I was nothing. Three years ago you had everything that you have now. - Brilliance, force. - No one thought it but you. I knew it, you just hadn't found yourself. You found me. You made me. Good heavens, you've have to go and dress, you're going out tonight. Now wouldn't you bring that up and spoil everything? The idiotic Blankenhorns' party. Well, I'm not going. Now darling, you can't afford to be discourteous at this hour. I can afford to be discourteous to the Blankenhorns at any hour. The Blankenhorns are discourteous to give such dinner parties. They're terrible, I know. Besides, I have some very important work to do tonight. But I insist on your getting some recreation. You really want me to have some recreation? - Of course. - Then give me a kiss. - That's all you get, now run along. - What do you mean that's all I get? - Hello, Reeves. - Good evening, Mr. Baldwin. - How are you tonight? - Fine, thank you, sir. - Is my wife home? - Yes, sir. And she's very anxious to see you, sir. She's in her room. Come. Well, hello, Lois. You sent for me? Sent for you? I've had Reeves telephoning all over New York. Well, you make me feel important. Oh, please don't sit down. We've barely an hour to get to the Blankenhorns. Or perhaps you've forgotten all about it. No, I've had a depressing premonition all day... ...and I have managed to make all my arrangements. - Was it so difficult? - No, very simple. I've worked it out so I can't possibly go. What? I had a wire sent to the dear Blankenhorns from Milwaukee... ...expressing my deepest regret for having missed my train. Larry Baldwin, you didn't dare do that. Yes, I need my strength for my business. Business. But you don't need your business. We've plenty of money. Now, Lois, we've worn that argument out so long ago. But you're letting your business lead us to ruin. - Ruin? - Yes, social ruin. Lois, for seventeen years I've been a social success. Where thou wentest, I went. And waited patiently. Your parasites have been my parasites. You seemed to enjoy it until you developed this fool mania for building things. And make a slave of you. Lois, dear. Don't you think we can sort of get together and adjust things? Some time can't we... can't we talk seriously? I mean some time between... between parties perhaps? Yes, let's. But not tonight. Between parties. Of course, between parties. All right, dear. Hello, darling. Hello, sweet. - Want a game? - You can't, you've just got time to dress. - I'm not going. - What? You lucky so and so. - How did you get out of it? - Oh, business. Pretty nifty. Shall I start then? Why, surely, what are daughters for? For sugar. - How are tall buildings? - Getting taller. Look here, youngster, I haven't seen much of you these last few days. Isn't it rotten? Mother would make me a debutante. - Any fun? - Oh, I get a kick out of it. Darn. And Mother's having the time of her life me launched. You know, darling, I hope that you don't take this social game too seriously. - How's that? - Not a bit bad, Mr. Hoppe. Oh, call me Willie. I mean, dear, don't ever become a slave to it. It's about all there is for a girl in this man's town. Oh, don't you believe it. What else is there? Can you imagine Mother if I went into trade or on the stage or something? How about marrying a nice young fellow that's really worthwhile? And spending the rest of my life keeping him sober? That's a career. No, I don't mean that, dear, I mean really helping him develop his possibilities. You might even help him become president. If that job ever becomes desirable agan. Get behind him, dear. Even if he only plays the saxophone. Make him a success. You'll enjoy success with him. It's a lot of fun. Even if he were a saxophone player. There! How's that for a run? - I'm glad it's over. - Oh, you are, are you? Because I want to kiss you. Oh, I know how it is, darling. It's the only way to be happy, sweet. I guess you're right. Oh, darn. Yes? I'll be right up. - I have to go. - Have a lot of fun. Fun? At the Blankenhorns'? Please, Mr. Hoppe. Some night we'll think up a good line, "stay home together". - Good evening, Mattie. - Good evening, Mr. Gibson. - You forgot your stud. - Huh? No wife to guide me, Mattie. Hello! You're going to marry me tonight? As usual, no. - You really mean it? - I mean everything I say. I know you do, that's why I can't get a line on you. How's that? You mean you're going to introduce this in the shop? Of course. Don't you think it'll be successful? Indecently successful, yes. What's the matter with it? It's long, long skirt. Yes, that's what makes it harder and more interesting. You should know. There you go, always making me out a Don Juan. When it's hot, I'm just a little boy in rompers. The old building is coming along fine, isn't it? I think it's the most thrilling thing in New York. Who? Oh, that, yes... You know, we'd make a marvelous team. Why, Link. I never knew you to propose twice in one evening. Well, you design dresses and I design buildings. What's the connection? Behind every skyscraper is a woman. You dress them up and make them beautiful... ...then some poor fellow comes along and puts up a skyscraper to lay at their feet. Oh, I see. - So that's the way it works, is it? - Yes. All those streets lined with skyscrapers were built by women. - What about the alleys? - A woman. What woman's behind the Baldwin Building? Now there you've got me. As long as I've known Larry, there's never been a woman in his life. Except, of course, there is Lois. Well, that's a pretty theory anyway. - Come on, here's your cocktail. - Thanks. - What's this, a highball? - Hm-hmm. Scotch, you don't drink scotch. I'm betrayed, woman. What man's been here? - Wouldn't you like to know. - Well, I don't know, I... Anyone I know? None of your business. Of course it's none of my business. That doesn't satisfy my curiosity. If we were married, I wouldn't have any curiosity. Darling, I wouldn't marry you if you were the last man on earth. And if I were the last man on earth, you wouldn't have to. As a public institution I'd have too many responsibilities. - You fool! Drink your cocktail. - I won't! I... - Sarah! - Yes, Miss Upton. I want you to cable these $600 to my brother in Paris. Same address, Miss Upton, 63 Quai d'Orsay? That's right. Oh, and Sarah... Call George Blaine and tell him I want to redo the second bedroom of my apartment. Tell him I want a real man's room. - Your brother's coming home. - Hm-hmm. See, on the 15th. Miss Upton, I'm so happy for you, I know how much you've missed him. Oh, thanks, Sarah. Sarah! Don't forget, tell Geroge Blaine I want that room a wonder. I won't. You know what that means, Larry. You can't come here anymore. You don't mean that, Nat. Yes, I do, Larry. You see, if Clarke found out about us, it would break his heart. Well, what is there to know about us except that we love each other? Larry. Larry, you and I know this love of ours is right. It's beautiful. We haven't hurt anybody and we haven't done any wrong. But with Clarke it's different. You see, he... He isn't just like a brother. I brought him up. - He thinks I'm perfect. - You are perfect. But, darling, he'd never understand. To him I'm... I'm his ideal. And you... Well, he'd just see you as somebody else's husband. I'm afraid it's goodbye, Larry. You know in your heart that we could never live without each other. But it would only be for a little while, until we can make some other arrangement. Do you really mean that this is my last visit here? I don't know what to say, Nat. This is the only place I can go for any happiness. Darling. Let's not make it any harder. It'll work out all right somehow. It's got to. I love you so. It's coming along fine, isn't it? - Clarke! - Nat! - Gee, I'm so glad to see you! - Let me look at you. You're still America's best-looking girl. You're taller. Where did you get the coat? I won it in a lottery. Let's get out of here! Oh, Clarke, you'll just love your room. It's all done over. Don't tell me, surprise me. Gosh, it's great to be back with you again after all these years. - Is it? - How's New York's smartest dress shop? I'm just getting embarrassed I'm making so much money. Great. Hope you got my dinner pail polished up. That's right, you'll be getting a job, won't you? Honey! Look at this. - Why, Link didn't tell me. - We wanted to surprise you. Oh, Clarke, I'm just walking on air! I'm awful glad you're getting a kick out of it. You certainly deserve it after all you've done for me. Oh, don't be silly, it was fun. Yeah, it must have been, putting a mug like me through the Paris School of Architecture. Sis, you've done something for me I'll never forget. You say one more word I'm gonna spank you. Ouch! - What's your first job. - Assistant at the Baldwin Building. - Hm? - What's the matter? Oh, I'm just overwhelmed. Gosh, it's great to be back in New York after all these years. - Here you are. - Thanks. - You'd better come along, Nat. - I couldn't possibly. The Baldwins are throwing a party tonight for that kid... ...that'll go down in history, you ought to see it. No. Well, pop in for a minute just to look at the gowns, hm? No. Well, I've got to put in an appearence. Shall I come back here afterwards? - No. - Hm. Well, will you have supper with me? No. How about a little ride in the open car, you know the air will do you good. - No. - Hm-hmm. - Have an hors d'oeuvre? - No! Will you marry me? No! Seven in the row, the game is crooked. It might be at that. Well, the house must give me a break some time. Even if it's just for the sake of appearences. - Hello, boss. - Oh, hello there. - A little service, please. - Well, you look very festive. - Where are you going? - The Baldwins'. Oh, Link, it was nice of you to give him a bid. - Who me? - Link's not taking me. - Hm? - I'm a boy scout around town. I've got my own invitation. - But you don't even know the Baldwins. - I certainly know Doris. She invited me. - Let me have a drink, will you, boss? - Certainly. - Where did you meet Doris Baldwin? - Last year in Paris, I knew her very well. She was at Madame Renard's when I was in the Beaux Arts. - Here you are. - Oh, thanks. Oh, I see. - Skol. - Prosit. Hm. good. Have one of your sister's cigarettes, I don't like them myself. Pretty good, Dodo. We're both pretty good. - Tired, Dodo? - No. Foolish girl just to leave that party and sit down here and watch me work. The evening isn't really being wasted. I've been thinking. What about? Oh, about how unnecessary parties, and theaters, and dances... ...all that seems when you can just be alone with somebody you like. Then you do like me. I didn't say that. And I'm not going to answer that question. Furthermore, I'm not going to make any more advances. You know why I can't make any advances. I do not. I've been advanced on before. You know I love you, Dodo. But I can't do anything about it until I've got a decent income. Listen to me, young fellow. We Baldwins are noted for our endurance. Then you will marry me, eventually? Oh, of course. Hey, what about your mother and father? Oh, I'll manage them. I tell you what. Until I've got some money in the bank, we won't tell anybody. Let's not. It'll be a swell secret, Dodo. - Hi, Mitch. - Is there anything I can do for you, miss? No, thank you, I'm just looking for somebody. - Nat! - Oh, darling, I'm so glad to see you. Oh, gosh, it's good to see you, you're drenched. - It doesn't matter. - Do you realize I haven't seen you in a week? - Will you order now? - Two pots of tea, please. - And sandwiches? - Just two pots of tea. Dear, we can't go on meeting in these terrible holes in the wall. - What can we do, Larry? - Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to ask Lois for a divorce. - Larry, have you thought about Doris? - Yes. She and I are pals, I can count on her. I know, darling, but she's still awfully young. - She might not understand divorce. - Of course she will. She's grown now, she'll want me to be happy. She makes her debut next week, there'll be nothing left to wait for. - I'm sure that she'll understand. - Oh, I hope so. Put it right there, please. Thank you. - Lemon? - Sugar. Of course. Come in. - Good morning. - Dad! Well, youngster, I expected to find you in bed. I've got a golf game on with a swell boy. You have, eh? Well. He must be a swell boy to get you up at half past nine in the morning. Perhaps we may have a serious talk about him before long. Uh-huh... Do I know him? No. And no further questions, Mr. Baldwin until I'm certain myself. Well, whether I agree with you or not, dear, you'll always find your dad sympathetic. Why, Dad! Feeling New Year's this morning? Well... perhaps I am a little solemn, dear. You know? I really think you are. Dodo, darling, I've come to have a very difficult talk with you. About what? Tell me, dear. Do you rather like me as a person, I mean, outside of this father business? Oh, you know that. You know, you told me one time that you didn't believe in the old conventional morals. That you had rather a modern, intelligent and tolerant attitude. - You did tell me that, didn't you? - Did I? Yes, I guess I did. I'm depending so much upon your understanding, dear. What is it, Daddy? Darling, when I married your mother, I realized that she didn't love madly, wildly as I did. No, Mother isn't like that. It isn't her way. No, but I did think that she'd care for me in her way. - She does. - I'm afraid not. Why, Daddy! No, I'm afraid I'm only part of her background. You shouldn't say that. I don't suppose I should, dear. But you see, I'm trying so hard to make you understand why I... Daddy. - There's someone else. - Yes, dear, there is someone else. Oh, but she's a splendid person in so many ways. She's a success. She's made me a success. Our affair is not a trivial one. We love each other devotedly. Oh, I want you to try so hard to understand. I can't understand. After what you told me, I hoped that you would. Oh, I know what you mean, Daddy. And I do understand, I suppose. But when it strikes home... Who is the woman? Her name is Natalie Upton. Natalie Upton? - Why, do you know her? - Natalie Upton? She's your... Doris. Well! Yes? Since I'm the third person in this poignant triangle, don't you think you might have discussed it with me? I intend to. But first I wanted Doris to understand that you wouldn't be hurt by a separation. You would upset my scheme of things considerably. I told her that, so that she' realize that what I needed was a human attachment. I don't see why Doris need know the nature of your emotions? Well, I do. I found someone who could give me the help... ...that you never would. Everything that I've done, everything I've accomplished... - ...in the past few years I owe to her. - To this woman? - Yes. - Really? - All your success? - Everything. Well, you've done very well in the past few years. Take my advice and have more of them. Have a dozen if you like. All I ask is you keep them where they belong. That may not be necessary. - I want you to give me a divorce. - No. And have you make us both ridiculous... ...because you were fool enough to lose your head over some cheap chorus girl? - Don't call her that! - Oh, give her profession any name you like. And save yourself the trouble of expounding her virtues. That is, if she has any. A cold, calculating mind like yours... could never understand the feeling that exists between Natalie and myself... ...and I'm not going to discuss it with you any further. - That's very sweet of you. - Thank you. Hello? Yes. Who? Just a moment, please. Miss Upton, will you see Mrs. Lawrence Baldwin? - Who? - Mrs. Lawrence Baldwin. She wants to see you personally. - Ask her to come in. - Ask her to come in, please. I beg your pardon? She's on the sales floor. She wants you to select some models. I see. Tell her I'll be right out. Miss Upton will be right out. Would you please sign this, Miss Upton? Thank you. - Where's Mrs. Baldwin? - The lady over there. - Mrs. Baldwin? - Yes. How do you do, Miss Upton? I've heard such glowing praises of your taste. I wondered if you would show me some of your collection. Of course. Shall we start with street things. Rather something to wear at home in the afternoon or evening. You know the sort of thing. Would you mean something that would be a little more... Something men like. - Miss Ellis. - Yes. Would you have Paula and Jean put on Black Magic and Christmas Night. - Yes, Miss Upton. - What an amusing name. - Do you do your own designs? - Of course. Then I'm sure that I shall see just what I wish to see. I've been admiring the room. - It was done by Blaine. - Oh, yes. He wanted to do over our house in Southampton. My husband is partial to Blaine. He wouldn't furnish anything of his own without him. I think one can always rely on Blaine. I'm sure his discretion is to be depended upon. Or men like Mr. Baldwin wouldn't use him so... indiscriminately. Christmas Night. Striking, but red seems such an obvious color. Extreme, of course, but one of our best models. Yes, yes, it has its possibilities. This is Tea for Two. We have some call for it. Naturally, it's quite in the modern spirit. You are to be congratulated upon giving people exactly what they want. Thank you, Miss Upton. I've enjoyed seeing the dresses. I can understand the glowing praises. Perhaps I can show you something you'd like better. No, thank you. I've seen everything I was interested in seeing. Good day, Miss Upton. Yoohoo! - Oh, you're home early, Miss Upton. - Hm-hmm. I sure got something cooked you like. That's good. Take those things and put them in my room, Mattie. Yessum. Oh, I nearly forgot. There's a lady in the living room from the shop. From the shop? Oh, thanks, Mattie. Hello, there! I can't see you. Wait till I put on the lights. What's wrong? Nothing serious, I hope. If it's about those sketches for Vanity Fair, I sent them by special messenger, they should... Oh, I'm sorry, I don't seem to... I'm Doris Baldwin. - Well, won't you sit down? - I'd rather not. Miss Upton, I've come to ask you to give up my father. That's asking a great deal. I don't think so. You would if you knew how much we meant to each other. I only know what my father means to my mother. Of course you do. But don't you think you're forgetting your father's side of it? Don't you think he has some rights? Your father and I have been very happy together. You've made him think so, but it isn't real. There can't be any real happiness in something that's not right. Is it not right for two people to love each other, to belong to each other as your father and I do? It's not right to disguise infatuation with the word love. This isn't infatuation. If it were, it couldn't have lasted as long as it has. There isn't any greater justification in love, is there? Why... why, it's all been perfect. We're not ashamed. Our love is beautiful and we're proud of it. Then why have you kept it a secret? We didn't want to keep it a secret, but we had to for a while. You see, you were very young and just starting life. And people don't think that these things... can be beautiful. And what people thought of us would have reflected on you. So for three years we kept our love hidden so that... So that it wouldn't hurt you. That was kind. But it hurts terribly now. Oh, yes... yes, it must. I'm dreadfully sorry. It isn't only me now. Miss Upton, do you think your brother would be in sympathy with this relationship? My brother? Clarke? Yes. - What do you mean? - Clarke and I... ...are engaged to be married. - You mean you and Clarke are... - We've been happy too. We're just starting. Can't you see that this would ruin it? His sister. My father. Clarke and I love each other. We belong to each other. We've got a right to our happiness too, haven't we? Why, yes. Yes, of course you have. I want Clarke to be happy more than anything else in the world. He must never know. I'll never tell him. Thank you. I'll see your father tonight for the last time. Good luck. That's the way it has to be Larry. - I promised Doris. - We can't, Natalie. We've had our happiness, and now we have to pay for it. You see, it didn't matter before because... ...we thought we weren't hurting anyone. Now we find that isn't true. We can't make life just for ourselves, Larry. I owe something to Clarke and... ...you owe something to Doris. I guess you're right, Nat. It was too good to last, wasn't it? Well, they can't take away those last three years away from us, can they? I'm grateful for that. Goodbye. Goodbye, Larry. Clarke. Three years to be grateful for. And who do I thank for my Paris education? The lady who gave her services... - ...or the gentleman who paid for them? - Wait a minute, Clarke. I wouldn't be proud of myself living on your money, but you'll get it back. Every dollar my sister spent on me, every cent of it. You'll get it back. - Clarke! - Oh, no, Larry, don't. You've got to go. I'll talk to him, I'll make him understand. Clarke! Clarke! Clarke, let me in. Clarke, you don't understand. Oh, Larry, please go. I've got to make him understand. Clarke. Clarke, it isn't what you think. You don't owe Larry Baldwin anything. Oh, Clarke, please let me in. Oh, h-h-hello, Nat? Listen, look, dear, what's the trouble between you and Clarke? You had a fight or something? Well, he came into the club looking like a ghost. All right, then I won't ask. Only he has some crazy notion of going to South America on that hotel job. Link, don't give him the job, don't let him go. I can't explain now, but... Tell him it's all over. That's all. Just say to him that... ...that it's all over, Link. And he'll come back to me. What? Just tell him that what he objects to is all over, that's all. Link, get him back to me, will you? Do anything! - Your shot, dear. - Oh. Oh, come on now. - I don't want you to feel like that, dear. - Oh, I'm all right, Daddy. Only I haven't heard a word from Clarke yet. Well, now, don't you worry about that. Mail service in those South American countries, it's terrible. The mail service is all right, he simply hasn't written. Funny, isn't it? The joke on me. I guess it isn't the first time. Oh, Daddy. There, darling. I know how you feel. You're more wretched than I am, aren't you? I know. Only it's worse for you because she's right here. It's all right, dear, we Baldwins are noted for our endurance. - We'll come out all right. - Of course we will. Only why hasn't Clarke written to me? My fault. Oh, don't say that, Daddy, don't. Only why hasn't he written? Your letters to Clarke don't come back, do they? - No. - You see. Yes, but then I haven't sent him any. Oh, Link. I don't know the trouble is between you two, but whatever it is, he's taking it far too importantly. I thought I wouldn't encourage him. I know, but he'll think you're taking my side. So I would if I knew what it was. Look here, that isn't what I came here to talk to you about. I came her to take you to task. Your secretary tells me that you haven't made a single drawing in six weeks. That's true, I don't feel like it. You should make your work suit your mood. When I get low, I design City Halls for Philadelphia. Eventually they make dandy mausoleums. - There's something in what you say. - Something is a lot. Look here, let's design a costume that looks like a City Hall. And we'll call it Blue Monday, hm? - Why? - Well, why not? - Link. - Yeah? - What are you drawing? - That is a pessimistic rabbit. See, you can laugh! Well, my work's done. - No. - No? Look at that dumb thing. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Mattie. - Oh, that's alright, Mr. Baldwin. - How is she? Oh, she's alright, except the cold last week. - Nothing serious. - Oh, I took care of that. The only misery she's got now is you and her brother Clarke. Mattie, does she ever ask for me? Well, she never mentions you by conversation, but she sure looks like she misses you. - How does she act? - Well, that's it, Mr. Baldwin. She acts just like somebody dead. But she never troubles nobody with her grieving. You watch over her, Mattie. - Oh, no, no, no... - I want you to take it. Now, I'll meet you next Monday night the same time here. Alright, sir, I'll slip out. - Thank you, Mattie. - Alright, goodbye. Hello? Yes, sir, this is the number. Oh, how do you do, sir? Yessir, she's home. Wait just a minute. Miss Upton, guess who's on the telephone. - Who, Mattie? - Mr. Baldwin. - Mister... - Yessum! I'm not home, Mattie. - Oh, but Miss Upton, I... - I'm not home, Mattie! Yessum. Hello, Mr. Baldwin. I done made a terrible mistake. Miss Upton, she ain't home. No, sir. Yessir. - Yessir. - What is he saying, Mattie? Yessir. - Yessir... - What's he saying, Mattie? I can't hear if you're gonna... Yessir. All right, Mattie, don't forget. Oh, no, sir, I won't forget to tell her. Hello, Larry. Larry. He's gone, Mattie. What did he say? - What station was that... - What did he say, Mattie? He said for you to tune in on the radio, station WEAF... ...at four thirty. Thanks, Mattie. Friends of Radioland, You are now in the tower of the tallest building in the world, the Baldwin Building. You are about to hear the introductory speech by His Honor the Mayor. Ladies and gentlemen. Just as this building towers above the skyline of New York, so does Lawrence Baldwin Tower in American finance. It is men like him, human, rooted in the earth, yet with their heads in the clouds, who have given our country... ...her proud place among the nations of this world. It gives me great pleasure to be able to introduce at this time Mr. Lawrence Baldwin. Your Honor. Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen. We all have our dreams. Some of us are fortunate enough to have those dreams realized. This building embedded in rock, but built upon an ideal reminds us... ...that man never builds alone. There is always a woman beside him. And to this woman whose sound advice and deep understanding... ...is responsible for what little success I may have achieved, and who is really responsible for the fulfillment of my dream, this building, to that woman I humbly offer my heartfelt thanks. Thank you very much, Mayor, I'm sure. I want to be among the first to congratulate you. Thank you very much. - Quite a tribute, Mrs. Baldwin. - Thank you. You should be a very proud and a very happy woman, Mrs. Baldwin. I am indeed. - Congratulations, my dear. - Thank you very much. - Hello, Link. - Hello, beautiful. Merry Christmas. Same to you. What are you doing, waiting for Santa Claus? Maybe. Oh, Link, you ought to be proud of yourself. Just look at that building. Isn't it marvelous all lit up? It has the proper spirit. We should be all lit up too. Oh, come on, get your little bonnet and shawl. I feel like doing everything we oughtn't to do. Yes, and I won't marry the poor girl either. I promise not to mar your evening with one honorable proposal. Sorry, Link, I'm just not in the mood. You're just in the mood to insult policemen. And at about 2 o'clock in the morning I'll dig up a couple for you. Oh, you idiot. No, serious, Nat, this is my big night. There's no one in the world I'd rather celebrate with than you. - Ah. - And it's Christmas. And I've got a present for you. - What is it. - Come with me and you'll find out. But now, Link, I can't, I'm dead tired. - What's the present? - Oh, Poopoo, come along with me. - But I don't want to. - You don't want to now, but in about 15 minutes you'll be so glad you came you won't know what to do about it. - Promise? - I promise. All right. You always get your way with women, don't you? If I said no, I'd be a liar, and if I said yes, I'd be a fool. - I won't be long. - All right. Link Gibson, where's my present? I got all dressed up for you, now where is it? It'll be here. Have patience. Would you like another turkey while we're waiting? No. I haven't lost my faith in Santa Claus. Here's your present now. - Is it? - Yes. Get me some cigarettes, will you, Clarke? - Sure. Give me a pack of Chesterfields, please. Clarke. Hello, Nat. Clarke, when did you get back? Will you please tell your friend I'm sending him his first check in the morning? Clarke, won't you understand? You don't owe him a cent. I'd rather not discuss it. Wait a minute, Nat. Sorry I bungled things. I never thought the kid would act that way. That's all right, Link. If only I knew what was the trouble between you two, perhaps I... No. That's something Clarke has to decide for himself. I see. Well, anyway, it's you that I'm worried about. Nat, I promised I wouldn't ask you tonight, but I'm going to. - Please. - Oh, in a wholly different spirit, I assure you. Nat, dear, even if you don't love me, marry me. And I promise I'll act accordingly. Only just let me be close enough to you to give you the companionship you need. Link, there's something you ought to know. Larry Baldwin and I have loved each other for three years. So it's Larry. You see, I'm... I'm not the woman you thought I was. Oh yes, you are. Whatever exists between you two must be fine or you wouldn't be in it. Pity the kid couldn't see that. He will, though, some time. I suppose Lois won't divorce him, is that it? Oh, it's hopeless, Link. It shouldn't be, You two ought to be together. I wished to heaven it were I. But as long as it's Larry that you want, why... I'd give everything I have to make you happy. - I've noticed something. - What, for instance? This is the third place we've been tonight that they've play that piece. And every time you've gone very absent-minded on me. - I'm sorry. - Oh, come on, let's have some fun. I'm going to get rid of my overcoat. I'll meet you here in three minutes. All right, Jerry. Doris, darling, where are you going? I don't feel very well. You'll excuse me, Mrs. Hollister. When Jerry comes down, tell him I'll be waiting in the car, will you? Excuse me, Frances. Dodo! Dodo! Dodo, we've got to have a talk. You don't want to talk with me, you've had a whole year! I just got back today, I tried to get you on the phone all day. Please, Dodo! Stop! Dodo, you've got to listen to me. - I don't want to see you or hear you. - There's something I got to tell you. - My sister... - I know all about that. Don't you see I made myself stay away, Dodo? I tell you I don't want to see you anymore. You don't mean that. Don't think you can go away for a year and come back as if nothing had happened... - ...and expect me to fall all over you. - Look out, Dodo! Hello? Larry? What? Larry, is he dead? Oh... Why... yes, of course. I'll be right out there. 32, Peekskill Road? All right. Yes, Larry. My brother is... Clarke, no, no, no, don't get up, darling. - I'm glad you're here, Nat. - Oh, Clarke, are you all right? Just a little shaken up, that's all. Oh, darling, what's that? It's just a cut, Nat, I'm okay, honestly I am. Oh, Clarke, I was so worried. Nat, I'm sorry I was nasty tonight. It doesn't matter now, I've got you back. It's all I want in the world. Hello, Nat. Hello, Larry. How's Doris? I don't know. I've got this local doctor with her. I've tried everywhere to find her mother. I don't seem to be able to locate her. Why don't you go in and see if there's anything you can do? - Oh, no, Larry, I couldn't. - Go ahead, sis, see if you can help her. If anything happens to her, I'll... Don't you worry. Won't you sit down? It's all right now. Your mother is here. Mother? Mother? Clarke. Clarke. Here I am, darling. Clarke... - I didn't mean to hurt you. - I'm all right, darling. You never even wrote to me. It was all a crazy mistake, Doris. You won't go away... anymore? Never again. Come close to me, Clarke. Kiss me. Thank you, doctor. - How is she going to be, doctor? - I can't tell. She's had a terrific shock. I mean, I can't tell definitely. I think you'd better let her remain here... ...four or five days before you take her to your home, Mrs. Baldwin. Larry, will you please take me to my daughter? She's in there. Come on, Nat. Let's go home. I, Doris, take thee Clarke to my wedded husband... I, Doris, take thee Clarke to my wedded husband... To have and to hold from this day forward... To have and to hold from this day forward... - For better, for worse, - For better, for worse, - For richer, for poorer, - For richer, for poorer, - In sickness and in health, - In sickness and in health, - To love and to cherish, - To love and to cherish, - Till death us do part. - Till death us do part. The ring, please. Place it on her fourth finger, please. - With this ring I thee wed. - With this ring I thee wed. Will you kneel, please? The Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you... ...and fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace; that ye may so live together in this life; that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting. Amen. Can you think of anything more contemptible... ...than his helping his own daughter to elope with that young man? Larry hasn't gone through half enough yet. He will, though. You know, it's you I'm worried about. Oh, I shall go on in my own calm way. - Yes, that's the trouble. - Why, what do you mean? Lois, you've held yourself aloof from this whole thing. And it's been magnificent. But do you think it's worth it? Worth it? You see, there are people who will be quite incapable... ...of appreciating your splendid attitude. Oh? What do they think? Well, they assume of course that you don't know what's going on. I see. So they think I'm a deceived wife. Well, of course they prefer to take the more amusing view of it. - But Larry isn't seeing her now. - I know, but he did. You see, that's quite food enough for the gossips. So they are laughing at me. Now, Lois, don't let that worry you for a moment. We who know you, we understand. Link, dear, I've made up my mind. I made it up yesterday. I'm going to Reno at once to divorce Larry. I'm amazed. You don't suppose I'm going to let those two stay here and make me ridiculous. - Why, of course not, darling. - Don't you think I'm right? Lois, I've never known you to be wrong. - Oh, sugar? - No, lemon. Oh, yes, of course. - Um, two? - No, thanks. No... Hello, hello Oh, Larry? This is link. Let me be the first to congratulate you, old boy. Why? Lois leaves on Saturday for Reno to divorce you. Yes, and look here, Larry. Natalie didn't tell you, but she's sailing tonight for Europe. You'd better hurry and catch her, you lucky... Hello, hello! No, I don't want anything, thanks. No, maybe I do. Yes, I do. -Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
