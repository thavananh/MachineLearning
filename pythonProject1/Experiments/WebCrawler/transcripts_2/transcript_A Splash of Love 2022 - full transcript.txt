Dr. Andrea, the Right whale samples came in with the counts, and I couldn't wait until Monday to see. Contaminants are down 40% from last year's specimens. That's good news. And there's a healthy-looking amount of blubber here, too. What are our counts this year? We're up an additional six whales. Six? Wow. Which means our food-conservation efforts are working... In the marine-protected area that you established. It would be so cool to see it in person. Conduct the count, collect the samples. Maybe next year. Maybe next week. There's an exciting opportunity on the other side of the country. We have a research grant that allows one of our Ph.D. students to study the Orca whale migration in the Pacific Northwest. This is actually really impressive. It is. You are my first choice for the program. Me? Oh, I don't know anything about them. But you're wildly curious, Chloe, It would give me insight into a whole new species of whales. And the more we know about the Orcas... the better we can protect them. Exactly. And I think this trip could give you the field experience you need to nail down your thesis and maybe even present you with a discovery that would inspire you to apply for the National Doctoral Scholarship. That's the most competitive award in the country. I'm more likely to get drafted by NASA than get that scholarship. You will never know if you don't apply. The research study trip is Monday to Sunday. This Monday? I was supposed to be moving in with my boyfriend, Marcus, this weekend. Oh, I didn't know you had a boyfriend, you spend so much time in the lab. Yeah, that's the thing... we're both Ph.D. students, and we hardly ever see each other. Honestly, I thought we were growing apart, but... he said he wanted to talk to me, and he seemed really excited, and then I saw a receipt in his car for a key cutter next to this little envelope with my name on it. That's very exciting, Chloe. Well, if you change your mind, let me know soon. Thank you, Professor. And keep up the good work. Hey, you. Marcus! How are the fish today? - It's mammals. - Right. Sorry. How are the big fish today? We got impressive lab results and this year's count is showing big numbers. Hey. Love big numbers. The bigger the better. In fact, I got the biggest numbers in our mock Wall Street session today. That's great! Congratulations. Why, thank you. Yeah, it looks like we're both exceeding expectations. Me in Economics and you in... Marine Mammar... mammanimal? Ooh. No. Mammalogy. Ah, right. Okay. Time for... "Sandwich-split Saturdays." My favorite day. You know, I actually wanted to talk to you about Saturdays. - They're great... - Mm-hmm. But we're both so busy that, outside of that, we don't get to see each other nearly enough, so, I was thinking... maybe... it's time we start sharing some space. What... what is this? Open it. I really have no idea what it could be. Keys! To our new place! Oh, I can't wait to show you. Welcome home. This is an office. Yeah! Our office. It's right between my lecture hall and your research lab. I can honestly say I wasn't expecting this. Hey, look, I know that this is a big commitment, okay, but I don't know, I feel like we're ready to take that next step. I don't think we're on the same page. Exactly. Exactly! Which is why we can finally find ourselves in the same place, at the same time, in between classes. I don't know, I think maybe I need some time to... Some time? Well, how about we reschedule for... for Monday? I'm gonna be in the Pacific Coast for a research trip on Monday. Oh, you are? Yeah. Yeah, the opportunity just came up, it's only a week, and then I'll be back for... For the big move-in? Sure, yes. We'll talk then. Bye. Bye. See you later. I'm glad you love it. - Hi, Dr. Andrea. - Oh, hi, Chloe. Is the research trip still available? It is, and it's all yours if you want it. Yes. More than anything. Oh, no. Okay... Maybe it's not too far to walk. Perfect. Ah-hah! We are going old school. Okay... Let's see here... Oh. Oh! You all right? Yes. Fine. It should be illegal to rent these things to tourists around here. Excuse me, I'm not a tourist, I am a scientist, and I asked for a smart car. Not so smart after all. Oh... you're funny. I'm headed to Mary's B&B in Cable Cove. Do you have any idea how far away that is? I do. If you call a tow truck, it will be a couple of hours, but I can get you there in five minutes if you want. Yeah, if you insist. I insist. Need a hand? Thank you. - Yes. - Good? - So... - I'm Chloe. Sorry, let's try that again. I'm Ben Winters, and you are? I'm Chloe Turner. Chloe? The scientist. Uh, technically, Chloe the Ph.D. student. Oh. Well then, Dr. Chloe Turner. No. Not yet. I'm studying Marine Mammalogy at Miami Central College. Oh, so you're here for the Orcas. I spent the whole flight reading about them. I cannot imagine what it would be like to see one in real life. You've never seen an Orca in the wild before? No. Just the 800 times I watched "Free Willy". As a kid. Right. Of course. You know, something tells me you're gonna love Cable Cove. Thank you for the lift. No problem. I'll call the tow-truck company, see if I can't get you a refund for the rental. You sure I can't give you a hand... Oh, no, no, no... Oh... What did you say your name is again? Ben Winters. You let me go on about whales that whole time and didn't tell me you have an entire business dedicated to them? I liked hearing you talk about them. If you need anything, don't be afraid to knock. Pretty sure I'll be fine. Right, a scientist not a tourist. You got it. - Bye. - See ya. Hello, friend! Seal! Seal! Hello! Oh! I'm gonna love it here! Oh! Hi! Hi. I'm Chloe Turner, just checking in. Chloe... Chloe? Oh, you're the student from Miami! Welcome! I'm Mary. I'm just so tickled you've come all this way to see our whales. Not just see them, I'm here to study them. Well, what type of research are you doing? I'm examining the Orcas' migratory behaviors, hopefully determining any patterns that would help us continue to protect them. Well, that's what we're all about here in Cable Cove. I am going to give you my favorite cabin. It's right on the ocean. I'll meet you right out there. Oh, okay. I have to say, I think this is the nicest bed and breakfast I have ever stayed in. I'm so glad you like it! Wait till you see the rest of this place. Oh, my goodness! Wow. You are gonna love this cabin. Mary, I already do. Are you sure I can't take your bag? Yes. Thank you. And don't worry about your shoes. It's very homey here. Come on in. It's so pretty in here. Should be all warmed up in here for you. It's perfect. Wow. I never get tired of that view. Yeah, I wouldn't either. So, breakfast is served every morning at the big house from 6 to 9. And there's a fresh pot of coffee on all day, so you can come up anytime. Oh, thank you, Mary. I'm gonna get out of here and let you settle in. Oh! No, no, no. Where's the camera? Okay, let's go. Oh! Sorry, sorry! - Oh! - Okay. - Hey. - Um... - Well, please. - No, I insist. Okay. You know what, that feels weird. - You should... - Yeah, I'm gonna go. Yeah. Hey, Sammy. Shoot! Is what you should've done 10 seconds ago. That is so helpful. Thank you for the tip. Yeah, no problem. I wouldn't worry about it. Orcas are notoriously camera-shy... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where are you going? To my boat! Gotta catch up to the pod! Excuse me. Pardon me. You've got a boat? You've got a boat. I sure do. Here she is. Wow, and you're going to pilot it? Mm-hmm. And you know what you're doing? Yes. Just... checking out the old bow here. That's the stern. Bow's up front. I know that. I was looking at it from here. So you've done this before? Yeah. Great. So you've got a full tank, life-vest, flares, bail bucket... Yeah. I'm sure all those things are here somewhere. And you've definitely checked the nautical forecast, wind speeds? Great. Well, if you need anything... Okay. I know where to find you. Thanks so much. Great. Actually, what is a bail... -bucket. You are lucky you were still tied up. I did not know the ocean would be so cold. You're not in Miami anymore, Chloe. I know, and now I've lost a whole day. Day's not over yet, you just need a little guidance. You know what, I'm gonna give Ben Winters a call... I don't think that's a good idea. Well, Ben knows more about the Orcas than anyone in Cable Cove. Yes, I'm sure he does, but he has offered to help me a number of times, and I've told him that I don't need his help the same number of times, so. Well, I'll take a look for some maps. Thank you, Mary. Hope you got something hot and strong for me, Mary? Sure do! You're the best. Oh. Hey! Hello. You're back already? I... I didn't quite make it out. I see. Are you in a bit over your head, so to speak? I'm fine. Here you go, Ben. Thank you. Why don't you have a seat... right here? Wow. This lovely lady could use a Cable Cove crash course, and you are the guy for the job. Happy to help. Okay, um, here's a bit of history. 120 years ago, they set up a telegraph cable line right here, giving Cable Cove its name. Now, the Pacific Ocean, which introduced itself to you today... Rather rudely... - Is all around us and it has a tendency to be a little moody. One minute, it's blue skies and calm tides, the next, it's white squalls and raging winds. Now the fun part. Cable Cove is known for its whales, specifically the Orcas. Southern Resident Orcas, to be precise. Wow. What else you got? Well, even though they are called Resident Orcas, they like to travel, sometimes as far north as Alaska, or all the way down to California, but this time of year, they always come back here... Because it's dinner-time. The Chinook salmon run brings them to the Salish Sound. That's right. To this river here. The Chinooks then return to the Coldstream River to spawn, and the whales just sit back and relax and wait to feast. In fact, it's the circle of life. I'm impressed. You did your homework. Well, it was a long flight. How's classes going? Oh! - Goodness! Sorry. - You okay? Class is... it's going great. I'm not sure who the student and who the teacher is. Well, that's the best kind. A symbiotic relationship. Thank you. Are these all for Saturday? They sure are. I just need to get them steamed and cleaned by then. What's Saturday? Oh, it's my annual Fine-dining Dock Dinner Party! Kind of a big deal around here. I get the lobsters flown in from the Atlantic, triple-A fillets from the Prairies, and champagne. The good stuff. Nice. Mary sells tickets and all the proceeds go to the Cable Cove Conservation Fund. What's that? It's an organization that helps make sure all the Resident Orcas keep coming back. You know, it's our busiest time for tourists. Between the Orca migration and the dock party, everything is booked up. I'm sure you must be super busy with the whale-watching tours then. Yeah, yeah. The first few days are a little light, but... Ben, why don't you take Chloe out on the boat and show her around while you still have a chance? I don't think Chloe needs my help. It might actually be nice to have a little local guidance, if you have time. Yeah, well, showing people around Cable Cove is kind of my thing. I'd love to help. Thank you. Hey, guys. Oh, hey, Ben. You headed out? Sure am. Taking Dr. Chloe Turner here to study some whales. Just Chloe, not a doctor. Not yet. Well, you've got the best guy to guide you. I'm Adrian and this is Shawna. - Hi. - Hi. I love your boat! Thanks. What a beautiful place to live. Yeah, it is. You just have to make sure you stay moisturized. No one wants to look like a salty old fisherman. Speak for yourself! - Good haul today? - Oh, yes. These ones are real beauties. Oh! Well, it's lovely to meet you all. Likewise. We'll see you around the Cove. Welcome to my second home. The Marine Magic. Nice! And definitely more magical than mine. On this boat, you only get splashed if you want to. Funny. Let's see... Oh, cool. Is that an underwater camera? Yeah, it is. With 4K digital imaging. Nice. As long as we're close enough, whatever happens down there... we can see on here. Awesome. I just got to figure out where to install it. Oh, don't put that... All right. - You all right? - Mm-hmm. Okay... why don't you find your sea legs, and we'll install this later? - That's a good idea. - Okay. I'm sure they're in here somewhere. In the back somewhere. ♪ Let it out ♪ ♪ Breathe it in ♪ ♪ Feel it now ♪ ♪ On your skin ♪ ♪ Let the ocean wash your fears away ♪ ♪ Away... ♪ ♪ Your heart is... ♪ Did you see something? Not yet, but I got a theory. You know, people always say we're "whale watching", but I think the whales are watching us. When they're ready to be seen, they make sure to put on a show. So you believe the whales know we watch them for entertainment? 100%. Yeah, the whales I know have big personalities. There must be food in the area! The big one just breached to let the others know! Yeah. And from what I can tell by its tail fluke, that's B-16, or Romeo, as I like to call him. - Romeo? - Yeah. This is Bravo pod, and he's a big reason why they're the biggest pod, with 33 whales. There are 33 whales around us right now? - Mm-hmm. - Wow. Tidewater to Marine Magic. We have Delta pod up here at Bowen Bay and it's a bit of a party. Over. Copy that. All right, Doc, let's see if we can get you closer. Where's the party? ♪ No fear of letting go ♪ ♪ Let it go ♪ ♪ Look at what you want Look at what you want ♪ ♪ What you want... ♪ ♪ What you want... ♪ ♪ Tell me, can you hear us... ♪ Wow. See what I mean about putting on a show? I have never been this close to a whale before. Ben, can I see the iPad? I wanna look underwater. Thank you. This is like a dream come true. The 101 on how to tie up a boat. Pull tight. Wrap it around the cleat, back again, turn, twist, and pull. Pull up. I'm going to need to see that again. It's okay. We've got all week. Okay, so... there are three major transient Orca pods... The B-, D- and E-pods. Yup. Bravo, Delta and Echo. Bravo is the biggest, but Delta has Granny. - Granny? - Yeah. She's the oldest Orca we have around here. 105 years old, but don't tell her I told you her age. Okay, okay. And their societal structure is matriarchal, right? Meaning that sons and daughters will stay with their mothers even after they've had offspring of their own. Yeah. They have really strong family bonds. That's crazy. That must mean Granny pretty much runs everything around here. She sure does. I wouldn't want to mess with her. She's kind of like "The Codmother". So what about the Echo pod? Well, Echo is the smallest of the three, which kind of makes it my favorite. There's nine of them, and they're a really tight-knit unit. We saw Bravo and Delta today. Where do you think Echo was? That's a good question. Come to think of it, I haven't seen them for a while. Is that normal? For an entire pod to be M.I.A. this time of year? Not really. But I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just a fluke. - Was that a joke? - A bad one. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. But they'll show up. They have to. Bravo. We saw you first. Delta. I'll find you, Echo. Good morning, Professor. Chloe, good morning! How was it? It was incredible. I got up close with two of the three Orca pods that migrate through these waters. I've been watching your underwater footage on the link you sent me! I could just sit at the computer and watch it all day! Aren't they just magnificent? I'm happy to hear you're starting to see the whales in their natural habitat. Now, where is the third pod? I'm not sure. But I was thinking of conducting some onshore tests today to see if there might be a reason the Echo pod is missing. That's a good idea. Do everything you can to locate them. Without all three of the local pods to research, any study you carry out would be inconclusive. That's what I'm afraid of. You know better than anyone that where there are questions, there are answers. Go out and find them. Thank you. Oh! Thank you! Still looking for the whales? Yeah. You know, those Orcas have always been unpredictable. You know, off the Florida Coast, we saw a major drop-off of the Right whales, and then when I investigated, we saw that their food source had been compromised. Well, you think the Echo pod might be migrating somewhere else for feed? Well, I think it's a good place to start. I know I'd migrate here for your cupcakes. So good! Thank you. Hi, Shawna! Oh, hey, Chloe. Looking to do some crabbing today? No, no. Thank you. I was actually wondering, have you seen the Echo pod recently? You know what? I don't think I have. - Hey, Adrian? - Yes, Captain? Have you seen Echo pod recently? That's the little one, right? Not since last year. I wonder why. How's the salmon run this season? I'd say it's the healthiest it's ever been. Yeah. Every whale in the region should be here. If we see them, we can let you know. Yeah, please do. I'm starting to get a little worried. - Good luck, Chloe. - Thank you. ♪ She waits for the sun to go down ♪ ♪ Comes up when there's no one around ♪ ♪ Keeps eyes locked on the ground ♪ ♪ Behind those eyes is a fire ♪ ♪ She's taken on the world ♪ ♪ She's taken on the world ♪ Oh. What's up, Doc? - Hey. - How's it goin'? It would be better if I could figure out where Echo pod is. Oh, I put a call out to some of the other whale-watching boats... Nothing yet. It's weird. I checked the water temperature, it seems normal. There's no parasites in the local shellfish, and there's plenty of salmon running. I've been doing this a long time, and every season, the whales get me chasing my tail. I don't have all season. I have a research study that needs evidence backed up by all three of the pods. What about a water sample? That's a good idea. I could take an extraction of the volumes and mutations of the phytoplankton. Algae, Ben. The base layer of the marine food chain. Right. Healthy supplies of it mean... - happy whales. - Happy whales! I was... right there. Well, I know a great spot to get a sample. Are you gonna eat that? Yeah. Of course I am. Let's go! - Okay. - Hurry! Come on in. You're lucky you came during the one week of the year when the water is warm. Ish. Yeah. I forgot to say "ish". I thought this was supposed to be the Pacific, not the Antarctic! The water's not going to sample itself. Breathe. Become one with the water. That's it. I'm about to become one with hypothermia. Yeah, I like to do a few cold plunges a week, follow it up with a beach bonfire. Very interesting story. You know what people usually like to avoid? Torture. Ah. Right. Hey, it does look like there's a bit of algae in here. Okay, gotta go. I can't feel my feet. Oh, slippery! Yeah, definitely... Definitely algae! What? Some weather rolling in. Does that mean we can't go out on the water tomorrow? Depends. Rain we can handle, but if it's bad winds, we'll have to stay on shore. Hey... do you wanna grab a bite at Mary's? Her sign says "Bed and Breakfast", but she really serves something hot all day. Maybe another time. I... gotta go defrost. Of course. Warm up those feet. - Mm-hmm. - All right, well, see you around. - Bye. - Bye. Marcus? Hey, Chloe! What are you doing at school? I'm just moving into my side of the office. I did take up a little bit more than half, if I'm being honest, but you keep your microscope in the lab, right? Marcus... I know, I'm supposed to give you your space this week, I do, but, you know, I just wanted to check in on the Orcas. We saw them jumping, splashing, playing. It was amazing. Nice. I thought they only did that stuff at the aquarium. No, no. They do it in the ocean, too. Look, Chloe. I know that sometimes we're on different wavelengths, but I really believe that this shared office is going to bring us closer together. I know you do. And don't worry, I'll keep your side of the office warm. See ya. Where are you, Echo? Mary! Hi! Heavens to Betsy! I didn't want you to get soaked first thing on your way to breakfast. That is so nice, thank you. Oh, it's just a little tea and toast. Boy, that rain is something. It seems you might be land-locked today. Yeah, I think my study is going to be put on pause. You've just got to get creative. Creative? How can I be creative in this? Well, being this close to the ocean might give you some great ideas. See you later. I'm sorry. Did I wake you? No, no. I was just enjoying the pitter patter. Thanks. Well, they don't call it "the wet coast" for nothing. It's a bit of a howler out there, but in my experience, no storm lasts forever. Everything okay? The water samples came back clean. I need some inspiration to figure out why the Echo pod is still missing. You know what, I know a place that just might help. Come on. Let's go check it out. Wow! Yeah. We call this guy "Biggie". I can understand why. We're lucky to have such an extensive variety of whales to study right here in Cable Cove, even after they've lived out their best lives. Whoa, whoa. Hey. Have the Orcas really been in the Salish Sea for 5,000 years? Yeah. That's our best estimate. Come here, I want to show you another room. It's... it's kind of my favorite place. I call this "the playground". Cool. It's mostly family heirlooms that have been passed down over generations. This is actually a part of a whale bone that's been converted to an ax. No way. - I can touch? - Absolutely. Wow. - It's cool, huh? - Mm-hmm. And this was actually a mold of my teeth when I was younger. I'll use it to talk when I'm old and toothless. I know. I know what this is. Of course you do. This here is an Orca fin. That's right. I actually found this guy. He was washed up on one of our local beaches. - Really? - Mm-hmm. I think it's exceptional what you have here. I just hope it inspires the next generation. The next whale watchers, the next doctors. Hey, do you think I can get some of the footage from your underwater camera? Of course. I've never seen our pods from that perspective before. I'd love to show the people we work with. Sure, I'll send you the link tonight. Hopefully, there'll be more footage to add if we get back on the water. The weather's clearing up a bit. Might be a little late to get out on the boat, but there is a place I could take you where we could see the whales out of the water. It's a bit of a hike, but the views are killer. If you're up for it. - Yeah, I wanna go. - Come on. - You good? - Yes. All right, we've got to hurry. Hurry for what? The sun is going down. Oh, right. Okay. All right, step up. - Thank you. - Almost there. Careful. Okay. I thought it would be cool for you to see the whale migration from a different viewpoint. Oh, my goodness. - See over there? - Yeah. Those are The Broken Islands. That's pretty much the start of The Salish Sound. So it's like a gateway, right? Exactly. If the Echo pod isn't already in the Sound, then they should be arriving shortly right through those islands. That's my best guess. They'll come. You just... have to be patient. Yeah, I just wish I had time to wait around and see them. Can't you extend your study by a few days? Or a week? I don't think so. I'd miss an important scholarship deadline, and... I'm supposed to be moving in with my boyfriend. Oh. Well, those are some good reasons to get back to Florida. Well, not like in-in... It's... it's complicated. Yeah. What's the research application thing? Well, my professor wants me to apply for a scholarship. That would mean I could spend more time here. Not here specifically, but... maybe. I'd like that. Oh... look. Just off the point. You see it? Wow. It's a humpback! Look closely. It's breaching! Look, there's another one! Oh! Wow. Wow. Pretty cool, huh? Thank you for bringing me here. Of course. Oh! It's so cold today! Yeah, the weather can change quite a bit out here this time of year. One minute, it's rainy, the next minute, it's sunny, but the good news is tomorrow's supposed to be clear, so we can spend the whole day on the water together. Uh, together with the whales, that is. Right. You want some coffee? Oh, yes, please. Thank you. Great. You know, that will actually be great for me. I want to take out my hydrophone. If we can get close enough to a pod, we can listen to their communication. Ah, I see. And what do you think they'll be saying? Well, it really depends on the sound. They're super smart and social, so they tend to talk a lot. Well, they'd get along great with my Aunt Doreen. I wonder where Mary is. Mary? Mary? Oh, hey. Mary, what's wrong? The storm last night was brutal. So many trees are down, and the only road into Cable Cove is underwater. Our guests for the weekend are stranded in the next town over with no way in! Oh, Mary. It's okay. We'll figure it out. Oh, thank you. It looks like all the reservations are for tourists from out of town, and they're all set to get here tomorrow. That means no whale watching, no fishing boat, no dock party. I mean, this is our biggest weekend of the year, and Cable Cove is going to be empty. How far away is the next town? It's Port Douglas. About an hour by car, but the only problem is it's one road in and one road out. And that road is closed. How far is it by boat? All right, it's looking like about four hours to Port Douglas and back by boat. That is if you time it right going through Deception Pass. That's right. What's Deception Pass? It's a narrow pass in a shallow body of water. The boats don't usually go through there unless they have to. The depth can be deceiving. Hence the name. You have to time yourself perfectly with the tides, otherwise you'll bottom out. Right now, this is our only chance of getting our guests into Cable Cove. I think it's worth the risk. I mean, I can go through first, radio back to the other boats when it's safe for passage. I'll get it done. We'll get it done. You are my hero, Ben! Well, this is Deception Pass, but I'm not loving the look of that channel marker up there. Looking a little too deceptive? Yes, exactly. Yeah, timing might be off by a couple of hours. What do you say we drop anchor? Ay-aye, Cap'n. Right. - It's back here. - Oh! - Right. - Yeah. Just tell the boats to hold off until it's passable. Okay. If you really want to understand a whale, you've got to listen. I'm sorry. What was that? Funny. - This here is a hydrophone. - Mm-hmm. It picks up signals from all over the ocean, way further out than a camera could ever capture. We drop it in, and the low-frequency calls are collected onto an app, but we can also listen right here. So, my Aunt Doreen, she works with the museum, she said that you could use the space as a research facility. Yeah. Then we thought maybe the history might inspire you. That would be great. Thank you so much. Wait. Do you hear that clicking sound? Yeah. That's the Orcas using echolocation to find food. They make noises through this space in their forehead called a "melon". It's pretty cool, right? Yeah. Do you hear that? That high-pitched sound? That's them talking to each other. They're close. Look, they're here! Four, five, six... seven. It's definitely a smaller pod. Eight, nine... yeah. I think this might be... Is it the Echo pod? That's them. Thank you. Yeah, a lot of whale action on the water recently. There you go. Glad we could help. If you're staying at Mary's, it's just a left at the end of the rail. There you are. All right. Bye. Well, one successful tourist-recovery mission. And one successful Echo pod location. Hey-hey! Oh, nice job. Yeah, I had a good teacher. Oh. Maybe I could take him to dinner sometime? I know just the place. It's close by, has a great view, wonderful owner. Are you talking about Mary's? Mm-hmm. Ding-ding-ding. Look, I got him breaching! I wish I could jump that high. Wow, I can't believe I captured that. Hey, do you see that right there? Yeah, yeah. That's Betty. She's one of the adult females. It's know it's hard to tell with the way the water distorts the images, but... doesn't something seem different about her? Maybe. I'd have to see it blown up bigger. Yeah. I'll upload it tonight and get a closer look. But, really, I'd like to see all of your photos blown up bigger. You're such a talented photographer, and your underwater footage is incredible. You got my link? Yeah. And I shared it with my sister, who teaches kindergarten. The kids went nuts. I love imagining that other people are watching the whales with us. There's something about the way you see whales. I just... I wish more people could see them the way you do, Do you think that would make them want to protect them, too? Absolutely. Oh! Hey, guys. Look who it is. Hey. I have never seen Mary's like this and I need to sit down after our day! We haven't had crab traps that full in a long time. That's not a bad problem to have. You're not wrong. I can take your orders. I can take them... oh! Right now. I am in the weeds, but I'm having fun! Well, I'll take the fish 'n' chips, please, Mary. - Okay. Two? - Fish 'n' chips? Looks like fish 'n' chips all around. Four fish 'n' chips coming right up. Might be the last of my cod. Food orders have been delayed with this washed-out road. But I'm not complaining. Look at this place... Full of visitors... Thanks to the two of you. Come on, it was nothing. Besides... we had a lot of fun... And we found the Echo pod we've been looking for. Good! Good! I can't wait to hear all about it... After I drop the fryers! Thanks, Mary. Did Echo pod come into the Sound? No, they were in the Straight, which Ben said is unusual for this time of year. Yeah, it's definitely not their normal route. But you know those Orcas... They have the whole ocean to play hide-and-seek. Oh, Mary looks like she could use a hand. Hey, I got it. I got it. - Just in time. - Thank you. So... are you staying in town long? No. Unfortunately, I have to leave at the end of the week. Oh, that's too bad. It's been nice to see Ben with someone who enjoys being with the whales so much. You both have a lot in common. Don't tell him this, but I would have been lost without him. Oh, well, he has been a little lost out here himself. I haven't seen him having such a good time in a long time. It's been really fun. It is so nice to have another girl around. It's been a lot of guy stuff since Ben's ex left town. Some drinks for you ladies. Oh, thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. I don't understand why. Ben. Hey. What are you doing up so late? I could ask you the same thing. I'm looking for answers. Huh. Me too. You know, sometimes you find them when the light hits a little different. I'm sorry, what? Come on. You've gotta see for yourself. I have never seen so many stars. You know what they say, there's more stars in the sky than grains of sand on earth. - Really? - Mm-hmm. That's hard to believe. Well, some things you need to see to believe. Like tonight. I knew I couldn't tell you... You needed to see it for yourself. - Hot chocolate? - Oh, yes, please. Mm-hmm. So what exactly am I looking for? You'll know when you see it. Can I get a hint? Sure. I spy with my little eye something that is green. I don't see anything green. No? Look up. How is... Aurora Borealis. Wow. It's just magic. I cannot believe you get to live here. Yeah, well, I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. Have you ever been anywhere else? - Yes. Thank you. - All right. I tried the city out for a few months last year, but sometimes, it's more than just the geography that's incompatible. And sometimes, you come to a place that seems far away... and it feels like home. What about you? Are you finding the answers you were looking for out there? Yeah. Yeah. Some of them. You? I think all my questions are still on my desk. You know, I was actually thinking of listening to the sonar recordings until I am fluent in Orca. But I don't know. I feel like it's going to take a miracle. A night like tonight kind of makes miracles seem possible. Doesn't it? Okay. Yes, open the email and the attachment. Now compare that to the aerial image of the Echo pod from last year. Do you see it? There does seem to be a much more significant bulge in her abdominal region. Right? Right? Because... she's pregnant! I would be inclined to agree with you. Given the Southern Resident Orca whale's small population, this is a phenomenal discovery, Chloe. How will we know when she's due? Orca whales gestate for 15-18 months. She's showing, but she could still have a ways to go. You know, I was wondering if her pregnancy has anything to do with the Echo pod changing their migration patterns. Is this what you're exploring for your Ph.D. thesis? Yeah! Plus, I was actually thinking I could build a website and live-stream the underwater footage I've been getting. The more people feel like they know the whales, the more they'll want to protect them. That sounds like a great idea and an excellent addition to your research. It's just that it would take a lot more time and funding to stay here long enough to be able to do that. That's what scholarships are for. Chloe, you have an incredible opportunity over there at Cable Cove to really make a difference. Now, the application deadline for the National Doctoral Scholarship closes at midnight on Sunday. That's the same night you're flying out. Do you think you can get it done by then? I've heard this is a place where miracles are possible. Oh. I'm looking for Ben Winters. Is he around? No. No. I think he's gone whale watching. Of course, always with his whales. Some things never change. If you see Ben, do you mind telling him I'm here waiting? Who... should I say is waiting? Shannon. I guess you could call me an old friend. Hey, doc. I thought I'd find you here. Hi. Wow. - Nice command center! - Thanks. And guess what... - Betty... - Uh-huh? Is pregnant! - What? - Mm-hmm. No way! This is great news! Not only is she expecting... If you look at the images from last year, she was pregnant then, too, which means... she's due any day now. We have to let everyone know. This is... This is great! The passing boats need to slow down. I need to let the whale watchers know that they need to stay an extra 10... Ben? No, no, no, 20 feet away... Ben. Yeah? Take a breath. I am pretty sure the pod's already protecting her. Yeah. Right. I also made one other discovery today. Shannon. Oh! Shannon. Shannon's my ex-girlfriend. - Oh. - Yeah. I hope she's not still waiting at your office. Oh, no. No. She's just returning my kayak paddles that I was storing with her. Yeah. Her and her boyfriend are turning their shed into a vlogging space for their cats. - Huh. - Yeah. But on the plus side, I got my paddles back. I was thinking... there's this really cool, super-awesome spot I could take you. I don't know. That seems pretty... Romantic? It's not. Totally professional. Scout's honor. Or whatever it is. Okay. Mary, why are you taking those down? The steak and lobster didn't make it past the washed-out road in time. - Oh, no. - There's no surf and turf. Well, isn't there something we can do? Well, I'm afraid the only thing to do now is figure out how to refund all that ticket money. No, don't do that. We'll figure it out. Okay. You know, the dock party's our longest-standing tradition in Cable Cove. It's a chance for Mary and the rest of the town to show off a little. There's gotta be a solution. I just hope I can figure it out in time. - We've hit water. - What? - I said we've hit water! - What? I'm in the water! Okay, we're going to set it down on the count of three. You ready? One, two, three. That's it. - All right. - All right. Come on. Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold! You can't play in the ocean if you're afraid of getting wet. Okay. Deep breath, okay? Happy thoughts. - And have fun. - Okay. ♪ The greatest thing I ever saw ♪ ♪ Walking through my open door ♪ ♪ Was you ♪ ♪ If what I say is true ♪ ♪ Every time you caught my eye ♪ ♪ You'd be there right on my mind ♪ ♪ Just you... ♪ ♪ And only you ♪ ♪ In a crowded room ♪ ♪ This world was built for two ♪ ♪ Look into my eyes ♪ ♪ Early in the morning... ♪ Land-ho. ♪ ...till the light runs dry... ♪ - Here you go. - Thank you. So, what do you think? I mean, this is beautiful! Right? Yeah, this place is a bit of a local secret. It really is perfect. I'm glad you like our little corner of the world. You'd be surprised what we can find here. You know what... I've got an idea. Stay here, don't look, and no peeking, okay? Okay. Chloe! What you got there? Hope you're hungry. - Oysters? - Mm-hmm. I thought you said this wasn't going to be romantic. It's not romance. It's sustenance. Thank you, but I don't eat raw fish. Well, it's not eating, it's experiencing. Besides, it's 100% protein. It's good for you. Okay. - Come on. - Okay. - Mm. - So? It's good, I like it. Mm-hmm. Good. Another one? - Okay. - I'm going to join you. - Cheers. - Cheers. To magic you have to see to believe. To magic you have to see to believe. - Mm! - Mm! - So good. - Mm-hmm. So, I was curious, do you have any theories about the Echo pod yet? I have one, and I'm basing my entire scholarship application on it, so I hope it's right. Let's hear it. I believe that the Echo Orca pod is changing their migratory patterns to suit the needs of pregnant Betty. They're staying out in the Straight, where there's less traffic, less competition for food. Mm-hmm. They're nesting, if you will. Yeah? My hypothesis is that once Betty's calf is born, they'll move to the Sound with the rest of the whales. Sounds like a pretty solid conclusion to me. Oh, no. I will not have a conclusion until I have evidence, which I'm hoping comes in the form of a happy, healthy baby whale. So what you're really saying is that your study is just another thing you have to see to believe. You get it. So, um, did you plant those oysters, or did you pick them up off the beach? - Right off the beach. - Wow. There's tons of food to forage around here. You're right... There is plenty to forage here. And Adrian said he had more crab than he knew what to do with. What are you saying? I'm saying Mary doesn't need steak and lobster to have a dock party when she has a whole ocean full of fine dining right at her front door! You're totally right. Wait. What is it? - Look! It's Betty! - What? Betty-Betty? Oh, my gosh. Do you want your camera? No. This is too special. This is just for us. It's her. It's her! Which means the Echo pod is moving closer to the Sound. So the calf could be born any day now. Yes! Mary! Great news! We don't have to cancel the fundraiser. You're able to bring lobsters back to life? No. We were thinking instead of flown-in food, how about we build a menu of all local ingredients? I mean, Cable Cove has all the fresh seafood we need. The tourists would get a great kick out of having the farm to table... The ocean to table experience. I don't know, I just stored away all the linens and fancy china. In the South, we do this thing called a "seafood boil-up," where we just roll some paper down a table and then dump everything in the middle. - That's a great idea. - That sounds messy. Messy, yes. Fun, also yes. Sounds like we've got it all figured out. Absolutely. I'll get the posters, let everyone know. It's going to be amazing. Party time! Whoo! Well, quite the dynamic duo you two are. Chemistry is undeniable, Chloe. Everyone can feel it, even if you pretend not to. Ben and I have something. You're right. But in two days, I'm gonna be on a plane to Miami, and he is gonna be here in Cable Cove, where he belongs. Don't you feel like you belong here, too? Maybe. Truthfully, this whole week has made me wonder what I'd be going back to Miami for. You know, whatever you want to call it between you and Ben... It's there. It's here. And whatever you choose to do with it is up to you. Take it from me, something like this only comes around once in a lifetime. If you're lucky. I need some Southern expertise. Ah! Wrapping paper or brown packing paper? Brown paper. All right. And no plates, you're sure? Yeah. Everything just gets throw out down the middle, which means we need lots of napkins. Got it. Some of the photos you took this week, do you mind if I use them for my website? Oh, yeah. Of course. That is the least I could do. - There you go. - Thanks. What are you working on? My thesis. I'm using it to pitch a live-stream web-link for anyone that wants to watch the whales underwater. When you said the kindergartners like watching it, you've inspired me. I inspired you? What? You've been inspiring me all week. I'd love to take you out on your last day. You don't have to do that. I want to. The Marine Magic's much better used for whale studying than just whale watching. Thank you. Make no bones about it. - Get it? - Mm-hmm. - Whale bones. - Yes. It's funny. You're laughing. See ya, Ben. Chloe. Chloe, it's the middle of the night. Marcus, we... we need to talk. Okay. Is everything okay? It is better than I ever could have imagined. Chloe, you're breaking up. - Are you there? - Yeah, barely. What is it that you need to talk about? I don't think this is working... You're doing a lot of working? That's great. No, Marcus, what I'm trying to say is... Chloe, look, I can barely hear you, so why don't we just chat when you get back, okay? Bye. So, dinner starts at five, which means we only have a few hours to turn this town into the best party that anyone's ever seen! Well, let's do this. We're gonna move the round patio tables out and replace them with the long dinner tables. Copy that. Ben, Chloe, you're going to add those twinkly lights to the dance floor, right? Good! And, Adrian, I need you to bring your guitar. You got it. Okay. Well, let's do it! And have some fun! Let's go, team! All right. Team, go! Ta-dah! - Amazing, - We did it. We actually pulled it off. I have a feeling it's going to be the best dock party yet. And one that I need to get cleaned up for. All right. We'll see you tonight. Wow! Look at this! Oh, my goodness. A little bit of everything. There you go. - There you go. - Thanks, Ben. And there, and there. Oh, look at you in a white sweater! Yes, it is white. I don't want you to get anything on it. Oh! Wow. There you go. Thank you, Mary. This is... special. Hey, everything good? Chlo... you look... amazing... Thank you. And I am wearing a bib. Yes, you are. Ben, you turned my photos into posters? I did. - I hope that's okay. - Mm-hmm. What I didn't expect is for the tourists to start making bids on them. Your photos just made a bunch of money for the fund! I don't know what to say. Don't say you want one, because we're all sold out. - May I? - Yes. Thank you. This is so much fun, Chloe! What a great idea! I've never been a fan of fine dining, it's hard to make rubber boots look classy. Well, I think you look gorgeous, and this looks delicious. Good job, everybody. Cheers. - Cheers! - Cheers. Cheers. And just when we thought we'd seen it all from Ben, he goes to throw the trap in the water... And forgets to let go! Boots on and everything... And you should have seen his face when he came back up! You know, he did say he loves his cold plunges! Yeah, and, you know, he's just happy that it wasn't a time when we all kept our cell phones in our pockets! You know, I'm laughing so hard, I'm crying. Excuse me. I still don't have a cell phone! For the record. Well, you might not be much of a fisherman, but you are one fine tour guide. Thank you. Shall we? Oh. All right. Whoo. ♪ Love... ♪ ♪ Is like a river ♪ ♪ To me ♪ ♪ One merciless motion ♪ ♪ Bound for a treacherous sea ♪ ♪ Love... ♪ ♪ Is like... ♪ No napkins? But we need to serve dessert. Um, we should help. Yeah, sure. There's some napkins in my office. Okay. Great. Napkins. Everything okay? I don't want this to end tomorrow. I need more time for my study, more time for... I usually just keep to myself around here. Same schedule, same routines, same people. And you came here and you... you changed all of that. Chloe, you changed everything. I never realized how amazing it would be to share all this with someone... until you. What I mean to say is it's been fun. More than fun. It's been incredible. I don't want it to end either. But Cable Cove isn't going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. And anytime you want to come back and visit... everything is going to be exactly how you left it. With at least one more Orca. That's all for tonight, folks! Make sure you have a great night's sleep. So your eyes will be wide awake for whale watching tomorrow! You know, I don't usually take Adrian's advice, but I think he might have a point on this one. Right, right. I would like to be up before the birds tomorrow. I always thought you were a bit of a night-owl. Wow, Ben. Nice one. Give me a sign. Pardon the interruption. Do you know where I can find the boat "Total Eclipse"? Yeah. We keep her down on slip 37, but we're keeping the big boats off the water today. Not for what I paid for her. See, my girlfriend, she studies... fish, and I can't wait to see Chloe's face when she sees the super yacht I've rented. Uh, Chloe Turner? Yeah. Yeah, you know her? Yeah. Yeah, I've seen her around all week. Small town. Right. You know what, she'll be looking for the Echo pod today, so your best bet is to take the boat slowly around The Broken Islands. Thanks, man. Oh, sorry about that. Don't worry about it. Shouldn't have put it there in the first place. Marcus? Hey! Surprise! What are you doing here? I came to win you back with a big romantic gesture! Yeah, by flying all the way here... to this place. - Where am I? - Cable Cove. Cable Cove, right! It's no Miami, but... maybe it's better from the water? I've rented us the biggest boat in the harbor... Six engines! You can't. I can't... What do you mean? Marcus, I can't do this anymore. I don't think you understand me. Honestly, I don't think we understand each other. There is something about us that doesn't click, and I know that you feel it, too. Yeah, I do. I get it. I just can't believe we're breaking up after I flew all the way here in coach. You are so brave. You are such a special guy. I would really like it if we could still be friends. Of course. And, hey, I tried. I know you did. I'm so sorry. Don't be. You obviously love it here. I can see it all over your face. You're glowing. I just want you to be happy. Thank you. Okay, well, I'd better hurry if I'm going to get a plane out of here. I wonder if I can still get a refund on that boat. Bye, you. Bye, Marcus. Oh. Mary, have you seen Ben? Yeah, sure, he jetted off on his boat. That's strange, we were supposed go together. Well, Marcus told him that he was taking you on a super yacht instead? He what? Yeah, Ben even told the other boats to call out to "Total Eclipse" if anyone saw the Echo pod. I was never going to go with Marcus, I was waiting for Ben. I have to get to his boat! Chloe!

You don't owe me a cent, not after everything that you've done for me. I only wish there was more that I could do for you right now. Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye to Ben? It's for the best. Without the possibility of a research scholarship, there is no way I can stay in Cable Cove. Well, can I get you anything before you leave? Tea? Coffee? Wine? Tempting. My car's gonna be here any minute. You will always have a cabin here, Chloe. You have changed this little town for the better and made your mark on all of us... Especially Ben. Mayday! Mayday! This is Marine Magic. I repeat... Mayday! Mayday! This is Marine Magic reporting complete engine failure. Flooded electrical. May need to abandon ship. This is shore calling Marine Magic. What is your location? I'm approximately four miles... Marine Magic? Come in, Marine Magic! Ben! Please, Ben! This is Crab Bucket to Marine Magic. We've just docked in harbor. Turning around immediately! Hold on, buddy! That's Adrian. He's at the marina! Hurry! Go! Wait! Go! Go! Ben! Shawna, it's choppy, and the water is so cold, how could anyone... He's okay, it's Ben. He's always okay. Crab Bucket to Marine Magic. Come in. Crab Bucket to Marine Magic. If his radio isn't working, does that mean it's underwater? I'm sure his electrical system is just flooded, that's all, but he's definitely not hearing us from here. Maybe he's at the inlet. How far is it? - Four and a half nautical miles. - All right. Hold on, I'm putting her into overdrive. There he is! He's okay! Hey! Over here! Are you okay? I am. Guys, I'm so sorry. My engine flooded and it took out my electrical. I've just been floating around, reconsidering my whole no cell phone thing. - We'll get her ready for a tow. - Thank you. Um... Ben, I didn't know that Marcus was going to show up like that. Hey, Chloe, you don't have to explain. No, I do. Marcus and I broke up. What? He's going back to Miami. We were never a match, and I tried so hard to ignore that, but when I met you... something just clicked. I feel the same way. With you, all the pieces, they just... I don't know, they just fit. Everything's new, and fresh, and exciting, and easy... Even when it's not. With you, I finally get what people are talking about when they say, "When the right one comes along, you'll know." Well, Ben... there are three things I know. Mm-hmm? I know I belong in Cable Cove. I know you are who I belong with. And I know I love you. I love you, too, Chloe. Oh! Hey, is that the Echo pod? I think so. Oh, my goodness! Wow! Ben, is that... Is that a baby whale? - Yes, it is. - Oh, my goodness. Hi, baby whale! Welcome to the world. I believe our littlest pod just got a lot cuter. Yeah, it did. And they're in the Sound, which means... My research study was right. - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you. All right. Let's get you back to Cable Cove. I think someone has a research application to complete. Mm-mm. There's plenty of time for that tonight. This is the kind of magic you have to see to believe. Good morning, Professors. Good morning, Chloe Turner. The board has reviewed your application and we do have good news. It was easily one of the best applications we've ever received. You're kidding? We're also awarding you three additional grants. Combined, this should allow you to stay at Cable Cove and start up your whale live-stream. Thank you! Thank you so much! We're going to miss you here in Miami, but the world will be better off for it. Congratulations, Chloe. Yes! - So? - I got the scholarship! Yes! I knew it! Which means I get to stay in Cable Cove! Congratulations, Dr. Chloe Turner. Welcome home. I am still not a doctor. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
