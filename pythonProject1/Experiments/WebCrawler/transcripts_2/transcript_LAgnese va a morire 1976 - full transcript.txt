Did you leave him there? Go get him. What are you waiting for? Hey, soldier! Come to my house! No, never mind that! - No, let me do it! No, forget about it! It's slippery. No, no, let me do it. You wash laundry, eh? It's my job. Soldier, over here! Maria? Maria, go feed the chickens! Kitty? A black cat brings good luck. You must be hungry. Yeah, I am. It's already quite cold. Feels like winter. If the frost comes, there'll be trouble. Where are you from, soldier? How did you manage to escape? From Vicenza. There were 12 of us in my group, but the Germans were about and we had to part ways. At Vicenza, there's a division? - There was. But as soon as the radio said the war was over, not even the mice stayed. Then? it's really over? There's an armistice. Now the Germans must lump it. Yours truly goes back to his village! You'll never get to your village dressed like that. Hand it to me. Check upstairs if we have anything for him to wear. Vandina! Vandina! Take your jacket! It's cold, come on! Please! - Listen to me for once, damn it! Please! - Here, give this to your stupid sister. It's cold. No, that's enough. You'd do well to eat, soldier. You must be strong. You still have a long way to go. Just an inch. An inch now, a foot later. Please! My mistress doesn't want me to. No, no! You see, she's not a nag. I know her well. We've been together for 20 years. If there's a pain in the ass in this house, it's me. Take them. I don't even know who left them. Thank you! She treats me well, you see. I still feel like a teenager On account of doing nothing. Diseases keep you young. It's hard work that ages you. I help in the kitchen. I do OK, right, Agnese? Like a woman. Palita, let him be. Can't you see he's falling asleep? Who? Me? I'll give you a hand. No, you keep them. But I still like the smell of smoke. Where are you from? - From Pavullo. It's in the Apennines. Of course, in the mountains, you feel more at peace. Neither in the mountains or the plains, can the Germans ever be happy. It's a matter of time. They lost the war. And they know it. - The worst is yet to come. The village is full of Germans. If they see him, he'll be arrested. I know. - Vandina said so. Send him away. They go after those who even hide them. There's nobody in your house. Why should you worry? Vandina said? - Vandina knows everything. You better go to bed. He's exhausted. He'll leave in the morning. Augusto! The Germans! The Germans! The Germans are coming! The Germans! The Germans are coming! - Augusto! The Germans! Hurry up! Be quick! Run! They're coming. Get him through there. Go! Thank you. Be careful! Come. Thank you. Thank you. Paolo Ottavi? - That's me. There are deserters here, Italian soldiers. Where are you taking him? He's sick! He can't work! Be calm, Agnese or it'll be worse! - Palita! Give me a hand. - Palita! I'm Cencio's son! They're taking us to the school! They're taking us to the school! In the town! You understand? Don't worry! It's food. For my husband. The men taken! To the station. They go on a long journey, ja? And where are they going? - The station. They took him when he was at the kiln. They also took an old man, Fedora's husband. Palita will never come back. He won't come back. He won't come back. He won't come back? Hello, Mrs Palita. Augusto! There's nobody here. Agnese? Laundress! Isn't Agnes there? Nobody answers. She's not there. I've some laundry to be washed. - You can leave it with me. No, I need to pay her. I'll be back tomorrow. We're really good at doing laundry. If you'd like? No, thanks. I need to come by again anyway. Ah, there she is! Good day, Agnese. - Good day. But look? it likes fate. When can I return? - In a couple of days. Here, what I owe you. - Thank you. Ma'am, goodbye. Goodbye. Wait! Wait, I'll help you! I can do it myself! - Hey! What manners! Yeah, do it all yourself. Go right ahead? See that? See that crap? She acted like I slapped her! There's no work. Can't my mama give you a hand? Get away! Go on and drink. You surely know that Palita is working with us? in the management of the party. You can speak freely. He's one of us too. He's a manager from the city. I know your husband's worth. Surely, he would've told you what we were doing. He would sometimes talk but I paid no mind. It was all men stuff. Men like Palita, as you see, when they can, they'll take them away. Palita did so much for us. If there's something I can do? if I'm able? For some things, women are better than men. Do you know Serena? Who needs men? If there were a 100 like her! Well, no, there aren't 100s, but if there were, then we wouldn't have to be here, in the house of Agnese di Palita, whom we can trust. Palita knows so many things that I don't know. All I know is that? that the Germans took him away! Because? someone had pointed him out! Because his name was reported! Tell me what to do. It'll be like if he told me. Thank you, Agnese. - Be careful though, if something happens to you, Palita will be angry with us. Palita isn't coming back. In Bagnacavallo, there's a blacksmith. His name's Mag?n. His house is at the end of town. You have to bring this to him tomorrow. Be very careful. They're pamphlets, fliers. Propaganda! It's a dangerous undertaking. Just one mistake and 20 boys will wind up in trouble too. They would get me or him for sure but it's easier for a woman to go among the Germans. Let's go. If you need to talk with me or Mag?n, or with other comrades, just ask for Tarzan. Tarzan. A funny name for someone like me, right? Who gave Palita's name to the fascists? If I only were sure. We'll find out and whoever did it, sooner or later, will regret it. If they accidentally stop you? No more bells! PARTISAN What's written? - Partisan. I'm looking for Mag?n. Who wants him? - Tarzan. We must prepare everything for tonight. It'll do you good. Will you stop with us for lunch? - Yes, thank you. Did you, by chance, pass by in the square? In the square? They'll want to keep him there for 3 days. We'll take him down as soon as it gets dark, What are you doing? What are you doing? Keep your stuff on the other side! But damn it! Have you gone mad? - Mama! Leave us in peace! We got the right to work here too! For the Germans? Fine work! They're Christians too! And they're good to us! And they're good to the girls too! Your husband must be proud! My daughters go to work. What are you thinking? They ask for them. We can't say no! We can't live by just working the land! - Come on, Mama, let her be. Let her be, she's an idiot! - What are you talking about? Isn't it enough what happened to your husband? Sure, it's all your fault! Get out! Out! Out! What are you doing? Have you gone insane? Snitch! You're just a snitch! Get out! - Stop! Who does she think? You were imprudent. You don't know for sure it was that girl. If you're going to work for us, you can't lose your head like that. I'm sorry. Does that mean you'll find somebody else? Why? Already tired of it? Look for another? That's all we need! The captain is pleased with your work. Agnese, these aren't fliers. It's stuff that can blow up. Be very careful. That must be her. Let's go. Are you Agnese? Go get the parcel. You know, I thought you'd be different. A bit more? Well, I don't know why. Did you meet any Germans? There's a checkpoint on the bridge. Is it for tonight? Well, we're off. Careful, in a while, this place'll be full of rabid dogs. Please, watch out. Agnese, I like you just the way you are. Thank you. Good apple. The partisans blew up the bridge. - That was the explosion earlier. Did you hear it too? - An explosion? No, nothing. There'll be a roundup. Get away, boys! Run away! Agnese! Agnese? It's me, Cencio's son. I escaped. Were you the only one to escape? Just me. I haven't seen my father yet. I'm afraid to go in town. Sit down. There are Germans everywhere. I can't go into the valley with the others. I can't stand anymore. I hurt my leg. Is that why you came to me? At least for tonight. I've come a long way. Do you know where? From Germany! From Germany? - Yes. Do you have anything to tell me? Tell me all. How did you escape? I don't know how I did it. If the train didn't stop because of the bombing? We had been in there for 8 days. Without food and barely any water! Palita too? Yes, Palita too. Hey, can you give me some bread? Yes. Eat. I know that Palita is dead. Ah, you knew? Who told you? You didn't really know, did you? He's really dead! He's really dead! Now tell me everything. How he died. Where he's buried? You must tell me everything. That morning, they took us out of the school almost immediately. Then they put us on the train. In the freight cars. The ones for cattle. They said we were going to pay a visit and then be sent to work. Before Rovigo, the train stopped. We stayed 3 days and nights without ever getting off. They made us visit the wagon of the German command. 5 at a time! Palita was with me. They made us strip naked and threw cold water on us. Since we were so dirty, the German officer didn't want to see us. Palita got a fever and was shaking. He told the German officer he was sick but it didn't matter. He started to laugh and said a little bit of Germany would do him good. Then the bombing began. So many died. They screamed at us to remove the bodies. I took Palita away and laid him on the meadow. I didn't even know what that place was called. It had a name with so many letters. I remembered it for a while but then I forgot it. Sorry. If he were alive, I swear I would've brought him with me. I told them that I don't agree! - No, no and no! If the committee decided, then that's it! Ming?cc, damn it! I'm sick from the neck down but my head still works! Tell that to the Ferrara guy! If anybody's fine with being caught, I know better than them! I've kept an eye on the locals, one by one for 20 years! Who's dealing the cards? If a fish's rotten, the whole basket stinks! Won't you explain it to him? - It's your turn! Hey? Well? It's nothing. It's passed. We weren't fighting. During play, one word lead to another. That cigarette! Drink. Besides, you're in charge. Now you're getting it. Play and leave it to me. Who's shuffling the cards? - Whose turn is it? Where did you hear that? The bulletin was on the radio this morning. - Please! But isn't that Agnese? - I think so too. Have a seat. Sit down. Thank you, Agnese. My son thanks you too. He went to the mountain to join other boys. They told me to come here because my house is no longer safe. What do you have to tell me? Take this. - What is it? It wasn't just me. It's from friends. People who know you. We thought a little money might come in handy. We put in what we could. Thank them all. Money always comes in handy. Cencio? - Yes? If I could find out where he's buried? At night, I close the door and I still see him in that meadow, near the railway. Let your son know, if he ever remembers that name again? Agnese! I've been waiting for a half an hour. I'm frozen. Sorry. I had to go through the town and was delayed. This must be delivered immediately to Michele, the guy from the mill. Take this to Tarzan. It's for the boys. It's a little money. I don't need it. Tarzan is dead. Tarzan? They took him last night. I'll take it to the captain. Is the captain shut inside with the boys? He is. Why? No reason. Just asking. It was a fine explosion! It was there before and now it's not. To rebuild a bridge like that? The boys put in the explosives. But? Who brought it to them? Who? Agnese! I brought some wine. Help yourself, it's the good kind. We've kept it hidden. - The war from 1915 to 1918? It was a disaster, a disaster? Stop talking, Papa! Come on! Drink up, go on! Drink, Hans. Drink. You drink too. - Here I am! Let's make a toast! The cat! Agnese's cat stole the sausage! Maria, close the door! Close the house door! That damn thieving beast! That rotten thing stole the sausage! Grab it and kill it! Go on, grab it! It ran behind the well! There it is! Damn rotten beast! There it is! There! Get it! Get it so I can kill it! Look, it stole the sausage! Rotten thief! - Mama, it's thief cat. Cat kaput! It's not the first time. It's always in the way. It has the instinct of a thief! - Forget about it! Why doesn't she keep it in the house? Cat? Cat? Cat thief. Cat kaput, Mama. Where is your town? My town? Me Prussia. You to come to Germany. - I wish! Who's there? - It's me, Palita's Agnese. I'm Clinto! Clinto! What happened over there? It's my fault: I killed a German. How did you get here? She killed a German. Cino, Zero, go and stand guard. It's best we leave here. Pir?n, Tom, prepare the boats. We leave as soon as we're ready. At night? - The moon's out. Agnese comes with us. See? We left just in time. - I'm sorry. You're sorry you killed a German? I don't care about the German. And I'm not sorry about the house either. How did you do it, comrade? Did you shoot him? No. I gave him a blow. Like this. I don't know how to shoot. Stop for a moment. Give it here. Like that. There. Come on, boys. Quick, hurry up! We're leaving immediately. Do you like this one? It's yours. Pugliese! Giglio! They've come! Everyone in front of Agnese's hut! Get the sacks! - Go! Hey, you! Do your hands hurt? Actually no. - Then help me! Take that. Do I look like I want to work? Hey, Pir?n! - Shut up, southerner! I've told you a 1000 times sound echoes in the valley. What were you thinking? Giglio, make another trip. Agnese! Are the Germans moving? No, it's all quiet here. And Clinto and the others? We weren't all together. They went to town last night. Agnese? - It seems there's been reprisals. However, when Clinto returns we'll find out something. Agnese! You hafta place this stuff in your hut. Please be careful. So much! Where did you get it? Where we can. The peasants take the bread out of their mouths to give it to us. No, I took it. It's my idea. Agnese! Agnese! It's for you. For me? But it's new. - She never used it. She got angry and didn't want to give it to us. Who? - The lady who gave it to us. Good morning, Agnese. Good morning. How are you? - Thank you. Good. I'm going to make coffee. It's Clinto. It's Clinto. How many were there? - 6, 7. They didn't have time to breathe. Did you get any weapons? Yes, but not much. A couple of pistols. You know, the truck burned down almost right away. Hey, look over there! Hey, what's that? What are you wearing? You're a great lady! It looks good on you! It's a Parisian dressing gown! It's the latest fashion! - It's a gift from Cino! What are you wearing? Continue. There were no reprisals in the village. What they had to do, they did at Agnese's house. They killed all 4 with bayonets. All 4? Who? Your neighbors: Father, mother and daughter. Spying whores! Let it be a lesson to all scum like them. Even the girls? They split open one of their stomachs. There was a baby inside. Which of the two? They said the oldest. That's what they told me. Vandina? Mario, Giglio, you two stay with Agnese. Africa? Like a visit? Damn it! What do you want from me? Damn it, I'll kill you! I will! Illusion! Sweet chimera? What do you want from me? Hush, African! Shush! Here. Where are you going this time? With the captain to make some noise. Say, Agnese, you like carrying stuff around that explodes, eh? Comrade! - Eh? Think about making a nice spread of garlic. One of these nights, I'll bring you a fine basket of eels. If the gamekeepers allow it. Hey, dummy! I don't give a damn about them, got it? Yes, a fine career for a poaching fisherman: More than 100 trials, 200 charges. He's lucky the war came! Why don't you tell her how I took down the gameskeepers? I hit them right in the middle of the forehead with my pole. They're all fascists. Not all, please! - You're right: All except those who died before '22. Tom! Pir?n! Quick, hurry up! - Come on, get your weapons. Get moving! - That Tom pisses me off. Come on, give it to me. Goodbye, Agnese. - Bye, Cino. Tom! Giglio! Mario! Tom! Where are you? I'm Rina, Tom's girlfriend. I'm Rina, Tom's girlfriend. They killed my father and my brother! Drink. Take off your dress. Now I'll look for something you can wear. Go away! Shoo! Take off your shoes. But how did it happen? I wasn't there when they took them. They tortured them all night along with 4 others. We women were in the square but they chased us away. At dawn, they shot them. How were you able to find us? Mag?n told me about it. My brother was in his group. Did anyone follow you? No. Keep drinking. It'll do you good. And when will Tom get back? - Soon. Was it a snitch? Tom knows him. His name is Veniero. I know him well too. Tom, come with me. OK, Pir?n. Come on. Pir?n, help me. - Yes. Lean on me. Go on. Rina? I want to stay with you. I'm afraid. I want to be with you. Keep this as a memento. Does it hurt? - Not so much. They say that would be worse. What's worse? When the leg doesn't hurt, that means it needs to be cut off. Who told you that junk? Tonitti, eh? No, he didn't tell me a thing. The opposite is true. If they cut your leg off, the cut off leg hurts afterwards. God's truth. Nonsense! I want to show you something. Look, this is a keepsake of ARMIR, from the Russian front. Just look at it. You know how I healed it? Disinfecting it with piss. You're luckier, aren't you? "Ay! Ay!" We're ready. Please, be careful. I only brought one magazine. No showing off! Did you study to be a doctor? Who? Me? No. Did you study to be a nurse? We're doing things we never thought we'd ever do. The problem will come later, when everybody will have to go back to what they did before. I understand what you mean but none of these boys can be farmhands, if things don't change first. It's not easy to change things. Would you like some grappa? - Yes, thanks. Thank you. You're quite good. - I do little. It's not little. - It is. I was a laundress. Palita was ill. We had no land. But I was happy. Do you want some more? - No, thanks. I never cared for it. There are many things here that aren't right with us. Palita said it was the people's fault. Change the people and things will change too. So he said. That's just what we're trying to do. At Veniero's, where Tom and the boys just went, his father bought for peanuts land from desperate people, like us. And the son does the same things. He's a gentleman, did you know? And also a snitch. I'm going to that poor girl. Did you know Palita? Yes. He was a good comrade, capable, prepared. He taught the boys many things. Then you saw him? When he'd go into town, did you meet him? I never met him personally. Back then, I was on the Russian front. Maybe he'd be here too. - What? No, I meant he would be here too. Why not? No, he couldn't do it. He was too sick. He was always sitting, reading. He had so many books. He'd take them down like medicine. But he didn't teach you to read? It was I who didn't want to. I had to work! Reading and writing? Stuff! We'll meet at my house next time. Bye, sweetie. - Bye, Veniero. You say that but never invite us. - Goodbye and see you soon. Bye, Veniero! - Bye! No! No! Help! They're shooting! They're shooting! They killed Veniero! - Let's go! The car! They're getting away! Help! They killed my son! Help! There's rust! - I see it. I got no sandpaper, I got nothing. - Fine, we'll take them apart. No and no! - Come on, Rina! Be reasonable! I've reasoned too much and now let me tell you: I'm not staying here and I'm not going to your mama either! You gave me your word. Right, Agnese? Go on. You're hardheaded! Please, make yourselves comfortable. What is it? - Speak out! Nothing, it's just that? Rina is all by herself so? It's nothing! But now she must stay with us. With me. Naturally, she wants to. And my mom wants it too. We all agree. I didn't understand anything. - We want to get married. Ah, well done! Congratulations! You've chosen the best time, eh? No, Captain, Rina didn't explain herself well. You must marry them. Me? - Yeah, that's what I meant. The certificate was ready but we had to go into hiding. And you're the captain, so? - Why would that matter? The witnesses are here: me and Agnese. Then if the witnesses are here, we're good to go. You shut up! Hold hands. Hold hands! For what it's worth, I'll marry you. Rina and Tom? Well? I declare? You are husband and wife. Is that OK? As soon as the war is over, do it again in the town hall, OK? We did it. Are you happy? Yes, thank you, Agnese. Rina! And the captain? Be still. Be still! Another big snake! Will you shut up, Africa? Always yelling. Kilos of them! Get down! Don't move! What is it? - We found him in the canal. He said the Germans are conducting reprisals. It's true and that's why I came to warn you. They burned everything at Tre Dossi. Sant'Antonio too. They're coming here. - Who sent you? Nobody. I swear. I thought it'd be right to warn you. Tell us where! Look, comrade, this one here, was the worst of the gamekeepers. That's not true. I always knew you were here. I never told anyone. I am your friend. Our friend! He's warning us today. And tomorrow? Tomorrow, he warns the Germans! How long will it take the Germans to get here? I think we can rest easy tonight. Are you sure? - Oh, yeah. Only I could bring the Germans here. Or maybe him! A pity. This will be the last time we dine here. You hear that? Agnese has decided for us. Tomorrow, we'll move. You look to the weapons. Come on. Any objections? - And what will I do with him? We'll hold him until tomorrow and then let him free. - What? He's half a fascist! So what do we do? Keep half of him? Tom! Tom, wait! I want to come with you! - You know it's impossible! I want to come! - Behave yourself, Rina! I'll tell the captain myself! Look, you're not saying anything! I will! - That's enough! Keep walking. Agnese? Do you remember where Walter is? - Yes. He's a good man. He'll take care of you. When will you come to get me? - I hardly know. Get going, you'll have to walk until evening. Goodbye. Come on, we need to go! - Calm down, there's no rush. Did you hear the captain? - Listen up now: Go get the oilcloth, then join me behind the hut where that hole is. Hurry! Come, go get the other one. There's more. It's getting late! - Hurry! They're here! They're here! The straw! More. More. Much more! Hey, Agnese! Wait for me. I'm going back there for a moment. You'll wait for me, right? - And where should I go? I'm on guard, right? They're shooting! Shooting! Don't worry! They're not after us! Let's stop here. No, let's go on. That way we'll arrive before night. No, we're still a long way off. Let's stop here. You just had to hide that stuff! We would've already been there by now! Come. They're still far away. Sleep. How can one sleep? Why didn't they take us with them? - Stop fretting. The Germans won't come here. Even they are afraid of the dark in the valleys. It's cold. Take this. Have you known him for a long time? Who? Tom? For 3 years. And they keep on shooting. It never ends! Will you go on honeymoon later? Sure, else what kind of marriage would it be? Did you go on a honeymoon? On foot, from the town hall to the house. Not in church? Just imagine Palita in church. The longest trip we made together was Ferrara, to the doctor. Palita went out of his way to miss the bus and so we slept over. He took me to the cinema, to the restaurant? I was so happy. Sometimes, he looked like a boy. Do you know the doctor took him for my son? Palita laughed for a week. And he called me "Mama." He'd say, "Mama, give me some medicine?" "Mama, bring me to bed." He was beautiful then. It's our camp. They're burning everything. Let's go away. I'm afraid! Afraid! Calm down! Agnese, let's go away! I'm afraid! I'm afraid! We coming from village! We airplanes scared! Bombs tonight! Boom! Boom! We escaping here! You partisan? - Oh, no! You partisan? White bread! Wine! Cheese! Salami! Here, here. You, Mama, nothing knowing of partisans? May you get cancer. Nothing knowing! No partisans! English bad! We go! Can we go? You going later. Now you sitting. Thank you. Thank you. Now you going. Going! Farewell, pretty young lady. Much love. Now they'll kill us because of you. Shut up. Are you the woman who killed a German? Yes, it was me. They're not looking for me, idiot. They're trying to scare us. They want to know if we've seen any partisans. And we've seen nobody! We took two partisans. One of them escaped. Partisan? You old partisan. Mrs Agnese! Come. Thank you. Agnese! Come here! Idiot! Mag?n wanted me to be a courier with him. I told him no. I can't do it and it's not work for me. I'll go to Argenta to stay with Tom's mother until the war's over. You understand? It's not for me. It's men stuff. It is men's stuff. I'm Walter. Come in. Cristina! Well done. And when you're done, I'll bring you a bathrobe. I warmed it up on the radiator. Let's go and leave her in peace. Now, Ada, let's find something for the lady. Let's see? We're sorry for leaving you alone like that, but it was getting late and we weren't sure? What is it? - Is the lady sleeping with us? She wants to know if you're staying. Yes, she'll stay for a while. Happy? Last month we had another guest, a professor from Ravenna. And before that, a doctor with his wife. Friends of the captain. That's what you call him, right? The captain? Have you known him long? Yes and I also knew his father. The captain is a fine lawyer. He has represented me many times, in matters of trade, business. Last time he lost the case though. - He was distracted. His head was already elsewhere. As you well know. Of course, I would've been happier if I went with him. But everyone is made as they are. But you're running a fine risk too. - Oh, no. Are there many of you in the valley? I really don't know. But you at least? - No! Don't ask such questions. Excuse me. - Sometimes just a word perhaps innocently referred to? Am I right? These are bad times. Today there are people who snitch for no reason. Sometimes out of fear or hatred. They are the first to run if they hear a cannon, or if a plane passes by. But when they see a partisan, they could go through a hail of bullets to report them. Not because they love the Germans but they can't stand people like you. Because you take the trouble to act even for those who won't move a finger. And their bad consciences are mortified by it, disturbed. A tip-off and their hearts are at peace. It is fear. Hatred and fear. Papa, what should I call the lady? She wants to know your name. It's lovely here. Thank you. Good night. Come, dear. The lady must rest. Good night. Are we letting her stay tomorrow too? Agnese! Agnese! You're a fine comrade. Seriously. Palita? You never told me anything. You never told me anything. Why? Who is it? - It's Mag?n. Agnese, it's Mag?n. Come in. You must come with me. The captain is waiting for you. They reached their new place. But on the way, they ran into the Germans. And then? And then? there was a shoot out: 3 wounded and 1 dead. 1 dead? Who? Well, I don't remember the name. He was the youngest. Cino? Aunt! Aunt! Aunt! You like it? It's a fine place. Yes, it's quite a fine place. I've had neighbors like these before. Here we are. This is my cousin. - Hello. And this is my daughter's husband. - A pleasure. Is your daughter coming too? She died under the rubble. - Oh, I'm sorry. Come in. I gave it a good cleaning. The German soldiers over there helped me too. Good. Well then? Is 3 months OK? Actually, a deposit was also mentioned. We all work, Ma'am. If you give us time? Alright. Did your cousin live in the city? - Yes, at her son-in-law's house. Then the bomb came and she could only save this stuff. Ah, if they ask you, tell them that my cousin's in good standing. Hey, Ludovico, do you have the todt card with you? But I wasn't asking for anything. Why should I care if she has it? Well, since you were asking? - Well, have a nice day. They seem like good people to me. Lorenza! They're evacuees. They lost their home and will stay here a little while. Where are the boys? Are they far from here? 2 hours by bicycle. That's a lot. Even if I made 2 trips a day, it wouldn't be enough? with all this stuff. You won't be alone. There'll be other women. And you will be in charge. In charge? Yes. Not the nicest words but that's the way it is. We talked about it at HQ and we all agreed. If I can do it. - Of course, you can do it. You've set yourself up nicely. Oh, God! I must get used to it. - They're on rations like you. In peacetime, you'll become friends. The war's success is in your hands: He who eats better wins. Then they've already lost. How can they win with canned food? Either it makes you sick or gives you diarrhea. Oh my God! Excuse me! To end up next to them, door to door? That's crazy! Who would've thought it? Pass behind there. It'll be better. See you tomorrow, at the same time, at the large dam. - Alright. There are Germans going about. Be careful. Here it is. - Thanks, Lorenza. Lorenza! Come inside! I see that I can trust you. You know, nowadays one has to get by somehow? Maybe you can buy something. It's sugar. Did you think it was a bomb? Imagine the cost! Don't worry about it. I bet your tenants do a little black market selling on the side, eh? Even the Germans do it. I'm ready to buy, OK? Thanks. - Here's another customer. Don't let yourself be seen. This is only for friends. Hey, guys! Agnese is here! Thank God, you're here! Mama Agnese! Hello! - Hey, how are you? I'll help you now, eh? I heard that Rina deserted you and ran away like a hare! Mag?n told you, I bet. - That's why he wanted her as a courier. A fast girl like her could furnish a whole brigade on her own. Is there pomade? - Hands off! I'm hurting! - You like our hotel? Tonitti! The Germans are in the street. Come, I'll introduce you to the other customers. Don't upset her. She knows that Cino's dead. She doesn't know how. Only I know and must tell her. - Knock it off! Come forward. Don't be shy. This is an English officer. He was a pilot. The others are English too. These guys are Yugoslavians. Comrades, eating? - Eating, comrade. That one's a Pole. This is Mama Agnese. - Mama? As soon as they can, they'll pass all the lines. Deserters. Austrians. Your organization is perfect. When do you come back? I must stay at the base. I'll send the couriers. They too have learned the streets by now. But Tonitti, what's wrong with him? Nothing! He was shocked by Cino's death. The water! The water! Quick, the stuff! The stuff! Tom! Tom! Pass it to me! Go back! What are you doing here? Hurry up! - Run upstairs! Hurry! Hold on to me! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on. Come on. Take it! Mario, what are you doing? You must bring it up! It'll be no use there! You too, Pugliese, get busy! Come on! Tonitti! Tonitti! Come on, we need to notify the captain! Water. Acqua. - I can see that! The Germans invaded the valleys to stop the allies and now? and now no more liberators, no more bicycles? For supplies, we would need Her British Majesty's navy, got it? You don't understand? Then you won't get mad. Go over there. Come with me, children. Mom, I want to stay here. - Be good now. When? - Friday. No more than 3. The watch has gotten tougher. With 3 at a time, we'll never finish. That's no concern of mine. British aviators? - British aviators. That's not all. - Half now. The other half when they cross the lines. And if something happens to me? Who'll pay my wife the other half? I didn't start this war! What are they shooting? Eels? There are no more Germans in Boscoforte. - Yes, there are. No, they all went away. They left by night. Very fine! Wasting bullets. They're shooting us! Get down! You leave and your companions will stay here. Don't understand! Not your comrades! They stay as hostages! Choose 3 civilians and put them in their place. You don't fucking protest! Now shut up and listen to me! You busted our balls, got it? We've had it up to here! Bombing wherever the fuck you want! Gunning down our boats! Don't even do one thing more! And then you want to know who we are! Whether we fight for us or for them! If we're Badogliani or communists! Our plans after the war! But when we risk our lives to save your shitty pilots, it's OK, eh? Don't understand. Don't understand! I'm sorry you don't understand. Because I want you to stamp in your head what I said. However, now you understand this: Don't shoot our boats anymore. Got it? If you shoot our boats again, I'll have these two shot! I'll have them shot, got it? Now go tell your command. I'll have you kill them! Here. And be snappy, eh? Tom, send me. Why those two? Send me. Don't start. Don't load up too much stuff or you'll find it hard to carry. Keep it light, OK? - Send me away, by God! I'm sick! I can't stand it here anymore! - Stop it! You hear me? - Stop it! Send me away! - Knock it off! Don't do that again, you understand? - Get him out. Don't do it again! - Get him outta here! Come on. Get moving. He's alone. - Go! Who is it? - Open up! Will you let me in? Who are you? - I'm getting wet! It's raining! Open up! Are you all crazy? - Who sent you? If you had a radio here, I would've saved myself a trip. I'm from the 14th. Which one is the captain? Give it to me. - It's as dry as a bone. I'd appreciate a drop of grappa, if you have it. Thank you. Mamma Mia! All this water! Mamma Mia! If you leave within 30 minutes, you can be at the base before day. I can't leave now. Why? Boy, am I thirsty! One more drop, thank you. Because there was a mess. I killed 2 fascists along the way and now I'm not welcome over there. Along the way? - Yes, along the way. There were two fascists with a motorcycle. With a wheel, halfway in the mud. I mean bogged down, that's it. And then one of them said, "You helping. You giving me a hand." And I couldn't say no. But I had a gun in my other hand. And now the streets are all blocked, full of water. And I don't like water? Thank you. Would you be offended if I say that I don't like you? That figures! Only women like me. You understood right away, no? - Will you shut up for a while? Clinto? The Allied Proclamation. General Alexander sends us packing. How could it be? Since the winter is harsh, the front has stopped, the allies no longer need us and advise us to go home. Read it. You're so kind, so good, but I'm used to eating before going to sleep. I'll make your bed now and after? - Thank you. What's your name? - The call me the Desperate. Desperate? - No, The Desperate! "The" is the first name and "Desperate" the last. I don't understand. What does it mean? It means there'll be no more advance. They're waiting for spring and the Germans will have 3 or 4 months to devote themselves to us. Some help? It's like the Munich Agreement. Scumbags! I expected it. Well, for all the help they've given us so far, we can do without the allies. Can't they see they're killing us? Roundups will become worse! Supplies will be low. The peasants will be afraid. They'll think twice before selling us a kilo of potatoes. And the boys in the middle of that water. Their nerves are shot. Listen to me: Get the boys and take them around to make some noise and we'll give the allies an answer. I must hear from HQ first. But even they? They must think of something. What do you think? If the General? What's his name? Alexander. I didn't even know he existed. What can I say? What you must do, you must do. Give me the bag. And the boys? - With the captain. Shouldn't you be in the barracks? - Agnese. I? can't take it anymore. Tonitti has gone mad. I don't know what to do. We need you. Did you see anything? Nothing! It's my fault. He threw himself from up there. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have left him alone. I told the captain. He should've gone out with the others. If he went into action, this wouldn't have happened. Tonitti wasn't crazy. We all need to get out of here. Tom. Tom! Come, hurry. Someone ran away! The Germans. They won't get far at night. With iron wire. Who tied them up like this? Untie them! We're not like them! With iron wire? You want your German comrades' forgiveness? - No? What do you want in exchange? - We don't? - Our lives? We partisans! - The entire brigade? We partisans! - Partisans! We wanting go home! - We not wanting leave! I leave it to you. Write down all the names. Ours and foreigners. We'll select 3 by lot. Alright. Agnese? Hurry up, we're all hungry! Come on, Agnese! My belly is empty! Great! - Aren't you drinking? I'll get you some. Easy! You always take the biggest piece! You're right because he is? I've said so! What can you do who look like a corpse? Can't you see you have one foot in the grave? Hey, you know what they put in the mortadella? Dead cats, old mules and a few Germans. Goddamn you, your mama and your relatives! Agnese, the wine! You two fight like husband and wife. Why don't you let the captain marry you? You hear that? Not even one word about Tonitti. It's like a dog died. Take it easy, Zero. He's the captain. He knows what he must do. Well done! - Happy Christmas! Grazia! Maria! Come give us a hand! What are you doing standing there? Come on! Merry Christmas to all! If I had a bomb, they'd be singing at their funeral! It's tough, Palita. I didn't think it'd be so hard. The captain was right. The allies and that general have abandoned us. This winter never ends. The boys are cold, hungry? and I'm in charge of supplies. Agnese di Palita is in charge. You would've never imagined it. If you were here, who knows how many things you would've taught me, I'm happy. I don't know how. For the first time, I'm happy. It's us, Agnese. The water's frozen. A sheet of ice like that, two fingers thick. The boat couldn't move forward. Do me a favor, put some wood in the stove. And possibly, a pot on top with something inside. And those boys? They won't have anything left to eat. I know. - They'll have run out of wood too. I know that too. Can't you walk there? - No, it's impossible. The ice can't handle a man's weight. Now I'll make some hot wine. It'll do you good. Pir?n knows what to do when the ice is in the valley. Send him a telegram. You'll see that he answers. I swear one of these days? - OK, but what did Pir?n say? He explained it all to me. When there are frosts, the poachers cannot go without. Alright, and then? - You'll need a sheet. This big. You fold it and put it on the prow. And the ice breaks like nothing. We have the boat. We need to find a metal sheet. Tom? What's the matter? Boys! Come on! Buck up! Come on, get up! You must bounce back. Come on! Pugliese! Pir?n! We brought food and drink. Come on! Tom! Come here. They can't take it anymore, huh? Can't you see? It is impossible to keep them in these conditions. They can't take it anymore. - Are you all hungry? No. Yes. Hunger is a part of it. But it's not just that. They're afraid. Afraid. We are afraid. Thank you. No thank you. Thanks, I don't smoke. Oh, yes. That's what we need. Thank you. Thank you. Listen up, guys! - We're tired of being here. Listen up! I found you in bad shape here. Worse than I could've imagined. You can't stay any longer. In the valleys, there'll soon be more Germans than eels. So we need to take action. We need a guide to get you past the lines. The lines? Let's cross the lines! The lines! One moment! - Alright! One moment! - Settle down! Not all together but in 2 groups. Captain, I wanna go with the 1st group! - And what are we? Idiots? One at a time! - OK. I must go to Rome! We have to go now, Agnese. Agnese! Agnese! And don't make your friend angry! Him? But I love this Southern jerk! - I'll bring him to my house! Agnese! Please, tell Rina. OK? Listen for one moment. - Hey, comrade! Hey, comrade! Hi! - Hello! Hi, comrade! Why don't you come with us? We can cross the line together. - No, I still have things to do. And then, we're not alone. We'll find the others. I salute you. - Captain, good luck. Now you're the captain. Come on! Come here! Come on! Come on! Go! What is it? - A minefield. What is it? - A minefield! Minefield? - I'll kill you! Where did you take us? What are you trying to do? But I've always been through here! Stop, guys! Stop! We need to find another way! - There is. Stay behind me! Over here! - Come on, guys, follow the guide! Come on, let's go! Where are we going? Where should we go? Come on, are you coming with me? You too! Follow me, come on! Where's the guide? Where did the guide go? Where are you? Here! Here, guys! Stop! Stay together! Don't move! Stop! Who's missing? Zero! Jim! Mario! Here I am! - Good! I'm here! Student! - The Student's not here! Student, answer! - Zero! Listen to Tom. - Let's hear what'll he say. Oh, God! Where's the Student? - I don't know. I don't know, he was here before. - And now what do we do? What do we do? - Enough! Will you stop? Keep calm! Tom! Should we go back? We can't go back! We must go to the appointment with the British. The minefield is behind us. We must go to the river bank. The allied lines are beyond it. We'll get there somehow. - Tom, stay close to me. I know a way to the river. It must be around here. I used to go fishing there. Fine, then boys, follow Pir?n! Go on! What's there? What happened? But that's not possible! It's impossible! Stop! - Look! Look over there! The Student and the Pole! The guide's not there! - He probably managed to save himself. He's probably wounded! You guys don't get it! We were taken for a ride! He left us here and ran away! He ran away with the money. He sold us all. And this guys! A fish and frog thief! He got us into this shit! You two-bit fisherman! He knows the way! What way do you know, eh? Shut up or I'll shoot you! - Oh, yeah? I'll gut you! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. From here, it's different. - Pir?n? This never happened to me with the boats. Honest. You are the captain. You must find a solution. You have to get us out. Let's go back, Tom. Let's go back to the barracks. No, there's no turning back, I go forward. Let's keep going. Because the appointment with the English patrol is from 6 to 7. If we're late, they'll shoot us. Even from allied lines. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Agnese? It's us. Pugliese! Pir?n! What happened? What was that? Come on. Come inside. Where are the others? Pir?n, where are the others? Pugliese... Where are the others? It was terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible? Pir?n! Pir?n! Pir?n! Stay down! Get down, come on! Goddamn you! Help me! Help me! My leg! My leg! Come on! Everyone to the river! Go to the river! Run! Run! Run! - Turn around! That way! Come on! Run! Get down! Murderers! Sons of bitches! Run! Everybody run! Escape! Run! Mario! Something terrible happened. I know. Who's up there? 4 boys from the barracks and 2 foreigners. What? They've been here since last night! - Are they crazy? In the middle of the Germans? Do they want to be massacred too? Pugliese, Pir?n, what are you doing here? What were you thinking? - I let them in! They were hungry and cold and didn't know where to go. Get ready, we're leaving now. Did I do wrong? Did I do wrong? I did wrong. - Yes. You really messed up. This time, you made a mistake, Agnese. Now this place will be burned forever. Don't just stand there, get something to eat. Did you hear me? I don't believe it. I don't believe it. Even these boys were given up for dead. But they are alive. Maybe the others will come back too. No, Agnese, no one will come back. Then they're dead: Tom? Mario? Giglio? Zero? What is the use of making a list of the fallen? Cino too. And the Student. And the Desperate. - Listen well, Agnese, if they're not here or have crossed the line, then they're dead. Got it? And now that's enough. Quick! Hurry up! Goodbye, Agnese. You stay here. I'll let you know where you need to go. Captain? I really mustn't do anything? Nothing. You mustn't do anything. Was I wrong with Agnese? She was wrong. She even knew that. I've never given her much credit. Isn't that what you think? You've never given much credit to anybody. Wait! Go to Agnese. Tell her? Tell her I sent you. Tell her Mag?n needs a courier. Go on. Hey, listen. Also tell her? Say whatever you want. I'll leave it to you. What else did he say? Tell me all. Many beautiful things, Agnese. I swear it. But you know that when he speaks? When you hear him you understand everything, as if you had thought of those speeches yourself. And yet you don't know how to say them yourself. Do you think the war will end soon? Who knows? Of course, if the war doesn't end, it will end us. No, that's not true! Them it will: the Germans, the fascists. When they die, they take away the living too. But not us! One of us dies and another takes his place. Well? Say hi to Mag?n. Clinto, I am old now and no longer have anyone, but you others can go home and you'll be able to tell what you've seen and done. In the evening, you'll gather? and start to recall: "Do you remember that time? Do you remember that other time? Do you remember Cino? Tom? And Giglio? Tonitti and Zero?" Because alive or dead, comrades will always be comrades. Even those who were nothing, like me. Look, comrade, I'm not here to complain. I'm just saying in the village? All right. The bicycle over there. There's no need to be afraid. They're not mad with us. They're not mean. If it weren't for those criminals who tormented them? They mustn't forget it was we who betrayed them. Well, in short, I meant if there were no rebels, after all? Oh, yes. You're right. The rebels die for the imbeciles. Mama Agnese! English subtitles by sineintegral@KG
