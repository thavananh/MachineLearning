foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Good morning, Madam. Where is Mr. Piaggio? He slept at the factory again. He's worried. Excuse me, sir. Your wife called, but I didn't want to disturb you. But then this special delivery letter arrived. I thought it might be urgent. -The bank, huh? -Yes. Tell my wife I'll call her later. I must talk to Mr. Rocchi Battaglia, please. I'm sorry. The president is busy and can't receive anyone. Nobody can go inside. What are you doing? How dare you? President, I am mortified. I tried to stop him-- Don't worry, miss. Close the door, thank you. Right away. -Will you explain what this means? -What do you expect? That you want to stifle me. Enrico, what an ugly word. This is my profession. Your profession should be supporting industries. And yours should be making them work. Even if your Vespa now has a competitor called Lambretta. When you have a competitor things go badly. If things go badly why are you asking for the money you lent me? You know I don't have it! Don't you think I should protect my bank's shareholders' savings? You don't pay the installments, I'm obliged to get the money back. You know very well I have to do this. The Board only gave you the loan because you made me insist. For Piaggio and its workers, who I remind you, started working again in 1946 and will continue doing so. Don't worry. Enrico, why are you making a scene? Go on! You'll see how much the other banks like you! -Miss. -Yes, President. Call Mr. Galvani of the Popolare bank for me. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. So, sir, how did it go? The banks are all in agreement. Rocchi Battaglia knew about the sales decrease. But so did the Popolare bank. I think one of us talks too much. -No. What are you saying, sir? -Oh, yes. -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. -Good morning, sir. -Tadini. -Good morning, sir. -Capecchi, how is your wife? A bit better, thank you. It seems the medicines are working. -I'm glad. Bye. Have a good day. -Thank you. -Ask him. -Sir? -You've nothing to say to me? -What should I say, Pacini? If the rumors going around are true. I didn't hear any rumor. What did you Union people hear? The factory is full of Vespas, competition is massacring us. It's normal that people talk about a crisis. We are worried. Everyone talks of a crisis! They always talk about a crisis! And yet Italy goes on. Even if it seems to bother you Communists. Huh? Everything will work out, Pacini. We just have to find an idea to sell these Vespas! I want to do my hair like Audrey Hepburn. They say she is shooting a film with Gregory Peck. -My gosh. -A modern fairy tale where the two lead roles fall in love along the lovely Rome streets on a carriage ideally transformed into Cinderella's coach. Lucky her! -Good morning, ladies. Remain seated! -Good morning. Finally, someone who is cheerful. -Was there a joke? -No, no, sir. We laughed because Wanda dreams of being Audrey Hepburn. -They're shooting a film in Rome. See? -Roman Holiday. "A modern fairy tale… ideally transformed into Cinderella's coach." ROMAN HOLIDAY Ladies! The break has long been over. -Yes, we're going. -Let's get to work. Suso, come to my office. Call Tadini, too. -Bring all your equipment. -All right. Here. Audrey Hepburn. And Gregory Peck. -What do you say? -Here it is. This really makes you dream. Two American stars fall in love in Italy, among monuments and Vespas. -It's a great idea. -Yes. Sure. If we are able to convince the film director. In fact. Mrs. Terlizzi, will you check the trains to Rome, please? -Yes, sir. -Thank you. You must leave now and try to talk to the film director. Me, sir? Yes. You and Tadini are our advertising office. -Maybe Tadini could go. -Tadini, do you speak English? -Actually, I don't. -You see? You must leave right away. I'll get expense money for you. -Sir, I don't think I am… -Stop calling me "sir". Rome, film, Vespas in the film. Go on, get going! An elderly man? -All right. -Thank you. We need 20 horsemen! Excuse me. Listen. Do you by chance know… Listen, excuse me. -I must talk to the director. -Do you have an appointment? -No, but… -Mr. Wyler is location scouting. He doesn't have time, anyway. -Please. -But… Actually, I must talk to the director… What manners! -Excuse me. -For what? On the contrary! No, I'll do it myself. Please. My name is Peter Panetta. -Yes. My pleasure, Mr. Panetta. -There's the American journalist. No… You're Peter Panetta who wrote the article on Roman Holiday? -Incredible, huh? Yes. Why? -Because I read it. Usually, articles are written for people to read them, huh? I am interviewing the director of Roman Holiday. I hope that you and others like you read my interview. Excuse me, Mr. Panetta for what happened. My name is Susanna Vannucci. Pleased to meet you. And I absolutely must speak to the film director. -Do you mind if I come with you? -Look. It isn't possible… What do you want to ask the director? That he must put a lot of Vespas in the film's scenes. -Interesting. -Yes. Yes, because the Vespa is modern, light, snappy. Yes, I fully agree with you. -Excuse me but I must go. -No. Please, Mr. Panetta. I came from Pontedera to tell the director all this. Excuse me, but… Isn't Pontedera that place near Pisa with the big airplane factory? There was. My parents worked there, but then the bombing took place and they died. I am… -I'm sorry. -But Piaggio is still there. It makes Vespas now and I work there. Now I see why you have this fixation for the Vespa. -Yes. -Well, come. -Where? -Your heel came off, right? -Oh, yes. -Come. We'll fix it. Please. -Easy. -Yes. -First airplanes, and now motor vehicles? -Motor vehicles? Vespa in an invention, a novelty. It got Italy on its feet again. -There. -Thank you. How did you make the Vespa from that destroyed factory? It wasn't easy. After the bombing, another terrible thing happened. Come on, quickly! To 33 and 31. -Bacco, come down! -Open! Puccini Giovanni and Patrizio, come down! Open the door! Vanni and Paladini, come down! Sir, they want to take the workers to Germany. Enrico, where are you going? -Sir… -Enrico, it's useless! -What do you want to do? -Enrico! Make way! Make way! -I said to get on the back! -Those go in the front. Stay back, stay back I said! What are you doing? A military operation is under way. Move! My workers won't go to Germany. Sir, don't do anything stupid. Go back to your friends and don't interfere. It doesn't concern you. Move from there! It's an order. Go! I said to go! Lieutenant! Lieutenant. Dad always said you were born to get into trouble. You'd had too much to drink? A little. -It's incredible. -Don't make me laugh. It hurts. Ralli had come to warn me. What could I do? Sure. But what will you do with them now? Fascists and Germans are running away, so… No, no. Fascists and Germans? Come see who is out there. -Your workers and their families. -Wow. You saved them and now you must take care of them. PONTEDERA, SUMMER OF 1945 As soon as the war was over, he was on the go again. Ready! Ready? Raise it! Come on! Come here, come here! Down, down. Capecchi, take this away. We'll put it over there. Yes, sir. Can you give me the scraper? Yes, but first we'll salvage everything possible. I'll be right there. -Dumini, shall I take this away? -Yes, go on. Capecchi, what did Mr. Piaggio say? When we finish, the bulldozer will pass, and then the masons will come. Miss Vannucci. Mr. Piaggio. How are you? So, so. I came to bring some flowers for my parents. Maybe you don't know, but they died here during the bombing. Yes, I know. We found them. I'm sorry. Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom. -Goodbye, Mr. Piaggio. -How's it going? Did you find a job? Did you keep up with your studies? I did domestic work for a lady in Florence. I'll see what I can do now. Your father said you were going to the Beaux Arts Academy. Yes. But I must find a job to support myself. Listen… Why don't you come work for me? You can be my secretary. What, sir? Everything is destroyed here. We'll rebuild it, Suso. We'll rebuild it. In fact, we're already doing so. See? Tomorrow morning at 8:00. Be on time, please. Oh! On one condition. That you finish the Academy. Your parents wanted that. Okay? -Thank you, sir. -I must go now, I'm late. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. Boys! I have an important appointment. See you tomorrow. -Thank you. -Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. More to the left. You must paint more to the left. Didn't your mom teach you where your left is? Left! Come on, little ones. Here's your food. You're hungry, huh? Come on, red boy, eat. -Wait here. -Thank you. You're welcome. -Thank you, sir. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Mom, look at the lovely kittens. Kittens, are you eating? -He's so cute! What's his name? -He doesn't have one yet. Where is their mother? Mrs. Luserna. Yes. This is all the International Red Cross sent us. -There's nothing else? -No, I'm sorry, madam. The colonel was suggested for the military valor gold medal. Thank you. Excuse me. Come, cutie. -Antonella, get up. You'll get dirty. -Can we keep him? Love, his mother is probably here. We can't take him away. -Go on, give him to the gentleman. -Darn it. Thank you. -Pardon. -It's nothing, madam. Mom, are you sad? No, love. Everything is fine. -His excellency will see you. -Tell him I'll be right there. Just a minute. Madam. -My little tiger. -Here it is. -It was over there. -What do you say? -Thank you, sir. -You're welcome, miss. Madam. Every day the press writes about this Italian industrial plan. But I've waited months for the factory's reconstruction financing. Your excellency, why hasn't it arrived? It's not in the Allied Authorities' interest that you build airplanes now. Not now, nor in the future. I don't want to produce new war planes again. I just want to transform them for passenger use, the military planes that the Allies left here in Italy. Listen, I will tell you honestly. You are just wasting time. -I understand. -Where are you going, Mr. Piaggio? You're very much appreciated. Everyone calls me and tells me about your heroic gesture or about your father. I don't want to disappoint people who care about you and your enterprise. So… I'll offer you excellent financing for a project study to transform your factory. A project study? And after that? Once the study is done, after that… maybe we'll find out that the project can't be developed. But meanwhile… you will earn. My studio, which I'm obviously not a part of during this period, because I'm Commissioner of Reconstruction, will receive an important assignment. Everyone will earn money and will be happy. Excuse me, but what will we produce? Income. Income for a certain number of people. People who know how to help one another. Thank you, excellency. But I already know who I must help. Excuse me, madam. I know I may seem inopportune, but I couldn't help overhearing at the prefecture. -I'm sorry. My condolences. -Thank you. May I offer you a ride? I haven't introduced myself yet. Enrico Piaggio. -Paola Bechi Luserna. -My pleasure. -What is your name? -Antonella. Pleased to meet you. Enrico. Please. Mom, what is in the box? -Nothing, dear. Little things. -Dad's things? Did you know I have newborn kittens at my house? And one looks like your little tiger. Do you feel like seeing them? Come. Here they are. -May I pet them? -Be careful. They run in all directions. He is so soft. If your mother allows it, you can take him when he's bigger. -Mom, can we? -We'll see, love. Here is the ladder, young men! Please, madam. Thank you. Miss. -When can I come get Musetto? -Oh, his name is Musetto? I didn't know. -It's because he has a cute face. -Yes. Whenever you want. Honey, go play now. I'll be right there. -Ada, will you hold it? I'm hot. -She's adorable. Easy. There's no need to rip the sleeve. -Thank you for distracting her. -Forget it. Slowly. Easy. You'll get hurt. -You want to give me a heart attack? -I was right in helping you. Helping me? -When? -When they shot you. They took you to the hospital and my Red Cross sisters and I were there and donated blood for you. Sir, when are you coming back? When your mother wants me to. -This is lovely. -It's my scooter. Ada and Mom don't want me to go on it. Excuse me, Armando, but I ran into a problem. My little brother is always late. -So, how did it go? -Terribly. The high commissioner only wants to make money. Who cares about the factory? -Can't you help me? -No, I'm sorry, Enrico. Unfortunately, the war has been tough, even for my facilities. I'm sorry. You're right. Excuse me. -Forget I said it. -What will you do? As Dad said… an entrepreneur must always invent something or he isn't an entrepreneur. But you didn't always follow in Dad's footsteps. Because I'm the second born. The second born can't be as boring as the first born, right? I've always had more imagination than him. Always. -So, what is left after the bombing? -There are some aluminum slabs here. -There should be some forks too. -Forks? Forks… Wait. I'll go see. Forks for the wheels of small planes. "Forks for the wheels of small planes." Then over there… there should be… -The landing gear wheels. -"Landing gear wheels." -Isn't there anything else left? -Sir… wait. There's a small engine here for starting planes. We can't build planes anymore, right? What is the engine size? This one is small, 98 cubic centimeters. What can we do with such small engines? Nothing. We could make those small motor vehicles that American paratroopers have. But they're ugly. I wanted to gather the engineers and department heads of the factory to think about something together, even if we don't have anything specific to produce. In Italy, we only have destroyed homes, roads, bridges, railways. There are very few cars in circulation. But for the country to rise again, it must be able to move. Tadini, please. So we have to create a simple method, one that is economic, one that everybody can buy. Excuse me, sir. We used to build airplanes. Which means we'll build a light, essential vehicle with the plane parts. Yesterday I saw a little girl on her scooter. -She got on, she got off, she curved. -Excuse me, sir. -Should we make a motor scooter? -No, we must make a motor vehicle. But one that isn't exactly a motor vehicle. A means that can be driven by everyone, even women. We're off to a great start. Did Fiat make the Topolino? We'll make the Paperino! Paperino? Now we must make the Paperino. This Paperino thing took up quite a bit of time. At a certain point they wanted to change the name. I would say so. Otherwise, Disney would have asked us for millions in royalties. For the copyright, that is. Thank you. May I call you by your first name now? No. -Are you interested in my story? -Of course I am. You didn't tell me how Piaggio got his factory working again. Where did he find the money? Where it was easy to find. In a place where it seemed there'd never been a war. -Great game. Let's have a drink. -Yes. Cosimo, I have to get my factory back on its feet, but I don't want to deal with the Reconstruction Commissioner. Don't worry about those Ministry people. My bank will lend you the money. How much do you need? -Will you be here on Wednesday? -Yes. Wait. Mr. Piaggio! -Look who is here. -Livia. You haven't been around, not even to beat Cosimo. Oh, no! I just beat him! And this gave me a nice opportunity to pay homage to you. Then I want many homages from today on. -You look very good. -Thank you. Enrico. -Let's get back to it. -Yes. -You want a fortune. -It's the least that I need. Are three monthly installments all right for returning the debt? -Yes. -Okay. I'll send you the papers. Thank you. I will rush straight to my attorney now. What will you produce instead of planes? I don't know yet myself, but you must trust me. Banks are founded on trust. How fortunate. I saw you at the club earlier and now I find you alone at home. The new governess. I need one today. Today the domestic staff is off. Children must never be left alone. -Will you drink something? -Whiskey, thank you. Let's see what our handsome man listens to. This one. Thank you, Rirì. Remember when you told me what they called you as a child? -I knew I would regret it. I knew it. -Little Rirì. You still haven't said to what I owe the honor of your visit. Well, I wanted to know what you were doing with Cosimo. Can't you imagine? Our past… is very hard to forget. Besides, you and I are alone now. It's not nice being alone. What a naughty boy. -The loan was given a while ago, huh? -Yes, excellency. And was it… employed? Yes. He spent it all to get the plant back on its feet, but above all to carry out a project. What project? The project that will soon give me the Piaggio brand. Something absurd! -Hop on! Put it in first gear! -Go, Capecchi! -Go, go! -Go on! That's it! Go, Capecchi! It's awesome! Enough. Stop, Capecchi. Suso, will you get on the seat, please? No, don't worry. Parked, just to try it. Please. NO SMOKING Sir, I can't… Wanda, do you want to try? Thank you. Sir, I… If a woman gets on it, you can see her legs. Understand? Women can't get on it. It's like a motorcycle. You can't take anything. It's worse than a motorcycle! Because it's uglier than a motorcycle! Then why bother producing it? The cumbersome part must be removed between the seat and handlebar. Away! -That is the engine. -We'll put it somewhere else. Sir, where should we put it? SCUOLA NORMALE OF PISA -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. -Yes, come in. -Mr. D'Ascanio. -Mr. Piaggio! -How are you? -What a pleasure! -The pleasure is mine. How are you? -Fine. I heard you're starting again. -Yes, yes. I was a refugee in a little town with goats, but don't think I didn't work on our project. Look. Isn't it beautiful? See? Gyroscopes and propeller joints are subject to less strain. Then I recalculated the thrust of the small back propeller so that-- Mr. D'Ascanio. I am not here to talk about the helicopter. -About what, then? -About this. Look. I want to produce a sort of motorbike for everyone. It's called Paperino. But it's not good. You must work at it. But sir, I do projects for flying machines. Engineer, you've used your intelligence for many important things. The punched card machine, the electropneumatic cataloguer. Oh, yes! The variable-pitch propeller that had Piaggio rise again during my father's days. Why not a motor-vehicle? Because I am interested in helicopters, not motor vehicles. D'Ascanio, life is starting over again. Men are no longer at war. They must go to work. Homes are being built, surveyors run from one building site to another. Children are being born again and midwives must go deliver them. Priests must travel around. None of these people will ever need a helicopter. Instead… All right, sir, but I won't take a colleague's project and correct it. -I prefer starting from zero. -Sure, I imagined you would. The problem, sir, is that I hate motorcycles. I don't want to construct a motorcycle. But a sort of motorcycle that is suitable for everyone. You see, sir… The problem is that a person who rides a motorcycle… gets covered with dust and is soiled with mud. The engine spurts out oil. -The chain rips your pants. -Right. We must cover the mechanical parts. But if we leave them where they are in motorcycles, we'll make another Paperino. And if you have a flat tire, there's no way of changing it. But you'll be able to find a solution, I'm sure of it. -The driving position is uncomfortable. -Exactly. That is why I don't like Paperino. I don't know why, but I've got a fixation on the scooter. I saw a little girl on one. She was so agile. -A scooter? -Yes. A scooter. A scooter. But on that scooter, we'll put a person seated. We are in a Democracy now. Women, doctors, priests, surveyors, even engineers that hate motorcycles. Everyone has a right to be seated comfortably. How will it hold up? With a self-supporting body. Like an airplane, like cars. -And the engine? -We'll put it to one side. Like this. If you put it on a side, it'll throw it off balance. No, we'll balance it with a fork from the opposite side. We'll make the fork like an airplane landing gear one, so if there's a flat tire, it's easier to change it. Right! Excellent idea! Right! Yes. But as for the cooling, the back brake and the shift, I have to think about it. Yes, sure. But we must hurry. Enrico, you may be a hero, but if a person gets a mortgage he must pay the installments. -You'll be paid, don't worry. -How will you pay me? -With your Paperino motorbike? -What do you know about Paperino? Word gets around. They say you don't like this Paperino. You may be a good tennis player, know how to choose clothes and cars, but as an industrialist… Your father always said it, too. -Then why did you lend me all this money? -Because I am sentimental. Let's do this. I'll cancel your debt and you give me the factory. I'll be the one losing out! What do you think I'll have left? Next week you'll have your money, even if I have to sell something. Who has the money to buy the things you sell? This is the Raffaello. They are bringing your car out here. -Please, madam. -Thank you. Have a good trip. -Good day, sir. -Goodbye. Treat it well. -Antonella. -Is Musetto here? Of course he is. He's become enormous. What are you doing here? Where's Mom? She's not here. What do you mean? How did you get here? -I took a walk. -A walk… by yourself? We must tell Mom right now. Come on. Come with me. -And Musetto? -Musetto… Guido, take the girl to the kittens and get the other car ready, please. -Of course. -I need to make a phone call. Did you see how much he's grown? Yes. Good boy, Musetto. We're almost there. -Does Musetto have a father? -Of course he does. But he wasn't there. When grown cats aren't sleeping, they always come around. -Did you know my father? -No. But I know that he was a hero. Heroes are never home. Antonella, you must never do anything like that again. Understand? Did you understand or not? Go home immediately. -And Musetto? -Give the cat back to Mr. Piaggio. Right away. That'll teach you not to run away next time. -What are these tears? -Mom is mean. -Now I'm mean? -No, Mom isn't mean. She was just afraid and she's right. Apologize to her. -I'm sorry, Mom. -Don't ever do it again. -Promise me. -I swear. You hear him? He's crying because he doesn't want to leave. Can he stay, Mom? Please, Mom. He's beautiful. -All right, we'll keep him. -Thank you, Mom. That's better. But if I hear you are naughty, I'll come and take him away. -Did you hear what Mr. Piaggio said? -Yes. Come, Musetto. Now I am your mistress. And you must do everything I say. -Ada, do you have food for Musetto? -Of course, dear. Musetto, you must eat if you want to grow up. Better not. He's already huge! -Thank you. -For what? -Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Why do you have all these papers? -I solved almost everything. -Really? Yes. I must come to the factory to start making models. -The shift? -On the handlebar. -Brake? -Pedal. -The cooling? -Dispersion wings. -Then we'll begin. -Let's go. Sir, where are you going? It's a prototype! -It doesn't have a license plate! -Where's he going? It's crazy. Sir, you're going out with a prototype? That's Mr. Piaggio. What is he doing? Mr. Piaggio! Let's get to work. -Good morning. -Hello. What is this? This is the future. Do you want to go for a ride? -Thanks, but I've got my house clothes on. -Good! You must be comfortable. Come on. Get on! Maria, please, hold these. It's so nice. Get on the side, here. -Perfect. -Wait. -Ready? -Yes. We're taking off! We're off! -May I try? -What? I want to drive. Are you sure? I have a driver's license. I can ride a horse and a bicycle. All right. -Come over here and I'll explain. -Yes. This is the clutch. These are the gears. A pedal back brake. The front one is here. This is the accelerator to be used with caution. -You don't trust me? -Blindly. That's why I'm willing to do it. Very funny. What is this contraption called? I don't know. We haven't given it a name yet. I think it should be a female. It's slender, full of curves. Right? The sound of the engine is like a buzzing. It's true. It sounds like the buzzing of an insect. Even the form. -It's like the shape of a wasp, a "vespa". -Yes, a vespa! It's true! It's strange for a name, but it's easy to remember, huh? -Get on. -Are you sure? -You said you trusted me. -I said that? All right, all right. So, the clutch. First gear. -Ready? -Yes. Slowly… Slowly, stop! Stop! You are crazy! Excuse me. I almost had you killed. -Did you hurt yourself? -No. -You got the wrong idea about me. -Oh, no. Forgive me. I didn't… -Shall I take you home? -Thank you, but I'll walk back. Hey there! Why did you disappear? I was very busy. Really? I understand. You were busy with a sort of nun who has a daughter if I'm not mistaken. You've started doing charity work now? Livia, I won't allow you to speak like this. -I know you're going to her now. -Must I ask your permission? It's fantastic! There's everything in this story. A man who struggles to make his dream come true. -A femme fatale and an angelic woman. -No, no. You can't tell anyone these things. They are private. Okay. So, a country that rises again and a man who struggles to create a dream. Yes. Americans like those kinds of stories. You have to put lots of pictures of Vespas in the article. Not those. They aren't Vespas. Convince the director of the film with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck to put a lot of Vespas around Rome. I promise that as soon as I interview him, I'll tell him. Thank you. Listen… I can call you by your first name now, huh? Yes. But take it easy, okay? Listen… But you… Do you have a boyfriend? No. What about you? -Peter Panetta! -Scott! Excuse me. Maybe Italian is better. No. I'll do some training. I was here to see Wyler. I was a consultant for his war films. What are you doing here? What kind of profession is that? You should've stayed in the Air Force. Maybe one day we'll see each other and talk about it. Sure. You're not introducing the lady? Susanna Vannucci, David Scott. You know something, miss? This handsome boy and I were in the same B107 crew. He was my bombing pilot. It's history. The lady isn't interested. I'll give you my calling card. Maybe we'll meet up, huh? -David Scott. -So you were his bombing pilot? And did you fly over Italy? -Germany, France, a bit… -You bombed Italy, didn't you? Well, actually… Suso, wait. -I wasn't alone. There was a war. -Don't touch me. My parents died under your bombs. Peter, Wyler has a half hour and he said to call you. Hurry. Oh, no, don't take it so personally. War is a terrible thing. And at times, even the best people, are obliged to do terrible things, believe me. Excuse me, sir. I made a mistake. I should have put my emotions aside. -I disappointed you. -No. You did everything possible. Yes? Sir, there's an American journalist out here. -He wants to talk to you. -Let him in. Maybe the trip wasn't totally useless. Remember not to talk about the film project. I've got the impression that someone is spying on us. Okay? -Mr. Piaggio… -Good morning. -My name is Peter Panetta. -Enrico Piaggio. Pleased to meet you. I had a chance to speak to Miss Vannucci and I came by car. May I interview you? Please. Could you really write an article for the magazine Life? Yes, I'm freelance. At times… -How many other times? -Three. -I mean, two. -Two articles published in Life? Did Miss Vannucci tell you how we started up again after all this? She told me about the contribution by engineer D'Ascanio and we got to the birth of the Vespa. I imagine it was all downhill from then on. -There are Vespas in Italy everywhere. -No, I don't think so. Italy is a country always going uphill. Please sit down. We presented the Vespa in Milan and in Rome. Big articles in the press, enthusiasm. Italy has started moving. But after two months we were full of unsold scooters and the plant had been occupied. I was obliged to take all the factory matters to my home. It's useless to call the police to have the factory emptied! The workers can't pay for owners' mistakes. -Bravo! -The Vespa is a flop on the market! And thousands of families risk being without salaries. This is true. Doctor Piaggio, either ask for help from the Reconstruction Institute or give everything to the creditors who can maybe pull the factory out of this situation. -That is what we should do. -Mr. Mayor! When my family took this factory, there were 100 workers. Seven years later there were 10,000. Pontedera was a small town and has now become a little city! We had roads, houses, schools, kindergartens built. Remember? -Nobody is denying that. -We built something together. Then the war took it away and we raised it up again! That is why I don't want to leave the factory to those who didn't do anything! Sir, the problem is, how long will you be able to pay salaries? -For as long as it's necessary! -That isn't an answer. For the time being, you must be content with this answer. When I can no longer pay the salaries, I'll do as you say. No, it's unacceptable. Wanda, why the hell aren't we selling this Vespa? I don't know, sir. It's so beautiful. -Sir, it's something so new. -Maybe it's too new! We must publicize it, we have to get it into the hearts of the Italians. Suso, get the drafts for the posters and fliers ready, everything. -Sir, I have never done advertising. -And I never made scooters. You know how to draw, huh? Then try. Get an idea. Let's all try to come up with some great ideas! MORE ITALIAN VICTORIES The workers have been striking for weeks, two late mortgage installments, and he throws away the last of his money on advertisement! He seems to do it well, he hired a big shot from Milan. He is digging his own grave. -Do you think he can last long? -That man is stubborn, your excellency. But it won't be long. -Let me know. -Of course, your excellency. -I want to get into this, too. -Dearest Livia! I saw you with his excellency from Reconstruction. And suddenly I realized why you lent Enrico money. -Livia, I am a banker. -No, you want the Piaggio brand. Because with that, whatever happens to the workers of the plant, you can pretend you want to reinstate the company. And with the help of the high commissioner, put your hands on a big amount of lost financing for funding. Let's suppose you are right. Why should I let you in on the deal? Because a beautiful woman, even if penniless, is always useful. You don't seem very penniless. My father practically ruined himself buying the Piaggio bonds before the war. The least I can do, is get some of that money back. Do you have any idea how to soften dear Piaggio? Beautiful women have many friends in strategic places. And arguments that can convince another friend. Well? Shall we partner in a company? We'll begin with something that bends him. THERE'S NO MESSING AROUND WITH SKILLED WORKERS -Maso, when are you returning home? -I don't know. The occupation is all-out. -What does "all-out" mean? -It means until it ends! Hey, what is it? Bettini, did you turn off the electricity? It must be Piaggio. He's even cutting off the electricity! I see. Have the generator turned on. I don't want everything switched off. All right, thank you. Sir… what is going on? They cut off the electricity and telephone at the factory. -Did the workers do it? -No. The Union advised me. Vanni, you must open the grey door and push the red button! -I can't see anything here! -On the right, looking at the doorway. The iron door and a red button. Red! WITH THE WORKERS -There! -Oh, Vanni made it! Bravo. Turn on the electric heater. Now check if by chance the telephone works again. The telephone has nothing to do with the electric current. Does anyone know how much fuel we have for the generator? Santerini knows, but he's coming for tomorrow's morning shift. -Did you do it? -What? Everything. They cut off the electricity and phone. I didn't even know that the factory was still occupied. I came to remind you of the installments you didn't pay. Why are you doing this, Enrico? You still have time. You give me the brand and I'll give you a nice amount that'll allow you to live as you please. Don't oblige me to turn to lawyers. -Cases, paperwork… -Go to hell, Cosimo. Excuse my vulgarity. Ralli, do we have a month? I've gone through accounts a thousand times. I don't know if we have a week. -I don't know. He seemed worried. -Miss Terlizzi. Prepare them for tomorrow morning. All right. It will take quite a while to type all these letters. But don't worry, sir. We'll work all night. Thank you. Sir, excuse me. -Are you sure? -What else should I do? I can only fire everyone. But you must not worry. -I don't want special treatment. -Enough, enough. I'm free to at least do that, right? Damn it. At least that. -Enrico. -Good evening, Paola. Pardon me, it's just that… I really need to talk to someone tonight or I'll burst. Did I disturb you? -Forget it. -Enrico. Did you eat? -I'll take her upstairs. -No, don't. I'll take her. -I'll lead the way. -Thank you. -Ada, please, can you clear the table? -Right away. I sent Rocchi Battaglia to hell. But I had the dismissal letters prepared for my employees. I never would have thought I'd do something like this. Never. Some of them were hired by my father. I wonder what he would say. Maybe I made a mistake, but what could I do? I don't know if you made a mistake. Or if your father would disapprove. But all those people put their trust in you. And I think that a leader, before anything, must trust himself. Yes, because others entrust him with their destiny. And maybe… Maybe they do it because they know he has a bigger dream. And he's the only one capable of having it come true. Would you trust me? I already trust you. I opened my home to you. I had you take my daughter in your arms. And you are here with me now. Let's go open, come on. Come on, guys, Go on! Come on! The change is here! Here they are! Great, comrades! This way. Come on, go inside. Come inside, come here. Come inside. Bravo! -Get down. -Come on, come on! There are drinks, too. Something warm, come on. Come on, Giorgi. -Come on. -Close the gate slowly. -Everyone united! -Hold it, it's hot. -Cheers! -Come on, guys! -What are you doing here? -Why did you come here? -You can't stay here! -Go! -He came to tell us the usual lies! -Please, let me speak! -Let him speak! -Please, let me speak! Calm down, be quiet. Let's hear him. You see these? They are letters I had prepared for your dismissal. Calm down! But then I thought of what they would mean for all of you! -For your families. -Yeah. So I decided they are better off here. -Did you come to make fools of us? -No! No! Two years ago some of you did not go to Germany because I did something crazy. Now I am asking you something crazy, to resist a bit longer. But all together! Last night a lady told me of her midwife friend. This midwife wanted to buy a Vespa to be able to reach her patients quickly, but didn't have money. We did all we could to keep the Vespa's cost low. But it's not enough! Because not everyone has money in cash to buy it. And the banks want guarantees. -Right. -Yes, it's true. So this midwife is putting money aside, a little every month. But we must let her have our Vespa right away. -Well said. -We must give her a hand! Allow her to return the money a little at a time. -Then installments must be made? -Yes! And not just to her! But to everyone who wants to buy a Vespa! Sir, but what if all these people don't pay, what do we do? Ralli, they'll pay. Aside from what everyone says about us, Italians just want to work and pay their debts. It's true! They are honest people! Honest people like all of you! And we must trust them! Right? Trust? What trust? What's trust have to do with it? You sell with installments and people pay? It's absurd! Yes, all right. Anyway, keep me informed. Thank you. Did you hear? Incredible. They emptied out the parking areas and picked up production. It seems that ever since he's been seeing this Bechi Luserna, he's been more forceful and trusting. Livia, are you listening to me? I need your car and your driver. Children, don't run so much! You'll perspire! Children! -Hello. -Good morning. I heard about this initiative and wanted to contribute. These poor children are so little, with those thin legs. We must have them eat something. Steaks? -I don't know how to thank you, Mrs… -Miss. -My name is Livia Rivelli. -Paola Bechi Luserna. Thank you. Meat is so costly and difficult to find. Don't worry. Lucilla, please accompany the gentleman to put it in ice. -We'll have it cooked tomorrow. -Go on. I am available, if there's anything to be done, Thank you. There is always need for an extra hand here. Come. I'll give you an apron. Usually, we make a plate of pasta and some jam or cheese, on alternate days. But today one of our sisters brought us sweets. -Enrico finances this initiative? -"Enrico"? -Yes, Enrico Piaggio. -You know Mr. Piaggio? You're right. I call him Enrico because I've known him a long time. We played tennis together. Does he still have that lovely record collection? I don't know. Excuse me. What reason brought you here? I came to help you. Listen miss, if you have something to tell me, do so. I just came to warn you. Enrico and I were very close. But at a certain point, another woman came and he dumped me. I just wanted to tell you, it's what Enrico always does. And why do you think that would interest me? Oh, it doesn't interest you? Well, I am happy that it doesn't interest you. -Happy for you. -Have you finished? We've nothing more to say to each other. Good luck. Lots of luck. -Thank you for everything. -You're welcome. See you tomorrow. Hi. Good morning. -How'd it go today? Good morning. -Good morning. Hi. What is it? Are you tired? Miss Livia Rivelli came to see me today. -Your friend. -She was my friend. Or maybe something more than a friend. -She warned me about something. -I imagine what she told you. Yes, I went with her. Maybe I've been inconsistent up till now with women, but… Enrico. Look into my eyes. Will you cheat on me? No. -Will you make me suffer? -No. I've found a marvelous woman. A family. They are two things that I don't want to lose. Maybe there's a way to make you understand more clearly. Cheers to the newlyweds! Then the Lambrettas arrived with all the other scooters. -Good morning. -Good morning. There was a real neck and neck race between us and all the others. Who won? A new idea was needed and… Oh, Suso! I was telling him about the competition. Will you continue, please? I must see Tadini about something. Thank you. -All right, sir. -Thank you. So, Tadini… After competing with Lambretta, we needed a new idea. But sometimes ideas are right under your nose and you just have to see them. Capecchi? Capecchi! Capecchi! What is this? I needed something to transport the parts. Sir, I'm sorry, but it seemed like a good idea. Oh, no. Good for you! Excellent idea, Capecchi. Go ahead. Excuse me. Not bad! Engineer… Italy is one big building site. We got men moving and now we have to get things moving. -Yes. -Capecchi is right. Can't we create a cart to hook in the back? No, it would be unbalanced. We must transform our scooter into a little truck. No, a truck is too big. We need something more slender. But maybe… So… we'll put a small box in the back. But at this point the transmission has to be changed. We'll put the joint here and a chain that transfers power to the two back wheels. -For it to pull more. -Yes. Maybe in the future we'll put a body on it to protect the driver. And that is the first prototype. I imagine you destroyed the competition with this. I wish! No, that's not so. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Yes, Suso. What should I do with her? I bombed your country, but I was following orders. Take her out. Take her for a nice ride on the Vespa. -But you say-- -Of course. What are you waiting for? Go on. I'll go to the testing office and have one prepared. Go on. Run, go on! Suso, hey. Listen. One week before I was assigned to the base in Sicily, news arrived that my brother had been bombed in Anzio. By the Piaggio P.108s. But… your brother is dead? No, but he lost an arm. But I don't hold it against your people. I don't hate you. Are you making a fool of me? No. You don't joke about these things. Can we make peace? Mr. Panetta? Mr. Panetta? Mr. Panetta. -Your Vespa. -Thank you. Let's at least make a truce? Maybe over dinner. Come on, just a short ride. All right. -Mr. Panetta, keep your balance! -Oh, oh! Keep your balance. Clutch… Clutch and gas. Hold on, Miss Suso! Wider turns. A little… Mr. Panetta, watch out. Clutch, gas… A little gas, go on. Go with the gas. Suso! -Panetta, come upstairs! -What is it, Mr. Piaggio? I've got an idea. I need you both. Come on! I'll hold it. Let's see what Piaggio's big idea is. This is old stuff. This is the idea. The actors of the film on a Vespa. -Good evening. -Evening. The American director Wyler will ask me a question. Why would an incognito European princess, and a sort of sloppy, American journalist go on a Vespa? -What do I answer? -Mr. Piaggio already told you. Because the Vespa represents lightness, youth, desire for love. It isn't just a thing. It's an image. Have we made peace? Maybe. -You want to dance? -Here? Yes. Why not? -No. I don't have the right shoes. -Is that them? -If I hadn't broken the heel… -I'd still have noticed you. Believe me. What about you? -What did you think when you saw me? -That you were a pleasant, clever guy. But then I changed my mind. I still don't know what you want to do in life. I want to win the Pulitzer Prize. -Oh. -Maybe two. Write the greatest American novel. Win a Nobel Prize. And above all, I'd like to find love. But this dream has already come true. Right? -Come. -No, no. -I don't know how to dance. -Let's dance. I'll teach you. -Come on! -All right. You dance and I'll watch. You can do anything. Look. -No. See that I can't? -Yes, you can. Come on! Did you know my hotel is near here? -Peter, I'm not that kind of girl. -I know, and that is why I like you. There. Just like in Cinderella. Darn. I'll take you home. Darn. Mr. Panetta. Do you have five minutes? Sir. No. Forget it. Luckily, you Americans are practical people. So… Let's say that for a while now, I've had an open account with Enrico Piaggio. Please. -Yes, I was told about that. -Yes. But you are a journalist and see things as they are. A business matter. I lent Piaggio a lot of money. Lots of money, to carry out an even bigger deal. To carry it out, I need for Piaggio to get rid of his factory. I've had a lot of patience until now, but the time has come. If you now come out with an enthusiastic article about Piaggio, -it would clearly damage me. Understand? -Look, in the United States we… In the United States business is done same as here. In the United States I write what I want. Of course, I don't want to tell you what to write. Of course not. That is clear. I'm just asking you to think about the timing. What changes if the article comes out in two or three weeks? It could come out after the choice for the film has been made. Hollywood creates myths throughout the whole world. If the Piaggio scooter should become one of these myths, he would be saved, and I would be very irritated. I don't know you. But we all have needs, dreams that maybe money could make come true. Everyone needs money, maybe not for themselves, but for a parent, a wife, a brother. The problems of a brother! There is almost nothing that money can't solve. Here. I already signed it. I put the zeros. You write the first number. A lot of money in exchange for time. Did you see the amount? He didn't bat an eyelash. We remained talking for a while. I tried to understand how he had access to this information, but he never revealed anything. Thank you. Most people would have accepted. If you help me, I will know which deal interests Rocchi Battaglia. -Of course. -I must find out who informs him. Surely it's someone who is here in this factory. But… he has access to personal data. So it can only be Ralli, Tadini or Terlizzi. -Have them all watched. -No. It would take too much time. We must find out right away. If I send a very reserved note today… Only to Ralli, to Tadini. I'll leave the third copy here on the desk so that Terlizzi can see it. It's hard for me to speak in person. I prefer saying it in writing. I am very ill. An incurable disease in my lungs. A very serious cardiac problem. An aneurism of the brain. Nobody must know. He wants to know who is spying on him. Three different notes. Very shrewd, but you caught him. Good. Talk to you soon. And advise me if there is news. Come in! President, sorry to disturb you. The journalist is here. -Did you call for an appointment? -Yes. Let him in. Perfect. Come, Mr. Panetta. -Panetta! What is so urgent? -Important news on Mr. Piaggio. Maybe it could be worth a few more dollars. You're developing a taste for this. I am sorry, -but your information is worth nothing. -No, let me speak. It seems that Mr. Piaggio is seriously ill. What do you say? -Interested? You want to know more? -Yeah! Lungs, cigarettes. -I always said he smoked too much. -Oh. Okay, forget I said it. Thanks anyway. Please, sit down. You must sign this letter. Sir, how can you think I… Maybe someone else knew about the illness. Or is spying on me. Or someone got into my office and read your notes… Ralli. Ralli, a little dignity. Your dismissal will go into effect immediately. Game, set, match! -Things are going well today. -You were ruthless. He wanted to be a wise guy, but he kicked off the wrong person. My spy sensed the trap and told me everything. But this means that he is not ill at all. -Maybe he is preparing a surprise move. -Livia, he's run out of gas. I don't think so. He has his wife. She saved him when I had his electricity and telephone cut off. She comes from an excellent family. And she is perfectly capable of moving contacts and money. Your orange juice. Madam. Let me talk to your spy. -What do you want to do? -Something very old. But that has the merit of always working. -Good morning. -Good morning, madam. Hi, love. -Antonella? -She's eating at school. Oh! Wasn't she supposed to eat with us today? Mrs. Ada forgot an earring. -It doesn't belong to Mrs. Ada. -Oh, no? -Who does it belong to? -You don't know? There was red hair. Your secretary, Suso, has red hair, right? Yes, but how could Suso have lost an earring here? -I don't know. Maybe in the car with you. -In the car with me? She was never in the car with me… Why don't you sit down? Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. -Did you find it in the car? -Yes, on the front seat. Are you jealous? Paola, I assure you… With Suso, of all people! -Where are you going? -Don't touch me. Are you kidding? Paola! She returned to her home with Antonella without getting her things. She said she'd send someone. Darn. Excuse me, sir, but you… I mean you and Suso… What are you saying, Corradino? With Suso? She's like a daughter. Miss, are you sure you never got in the car with Mr. Piaggio? Yes. -Not even to put an envelope inside? -No, no. I don't know how my earring possibly… The other day I was talking on the phone and they were bothering me. I took them off and put them on the desk. I never found them. I didn't bother because it was custom jewelry and I didn’t care. I don't know how it's possible. -We must tell Mr. Piaggio. Maybe… -No. No, not him. -No, no. -Suso? Yes, I understand. No. His wife returned to her home. He is distracted. Very nervous. He didn't take it well. Of course. Sure, I'll keep you informed. Don't worry. Goodbye. Miss, who were you talking to? My mother. She isn't well and is home alone. Miss, it's D'Ascanio. Can you give me the last number that this phone called? I don't want to live here. You were born here. You'll get used to it. No, I won't! I'll go. -Madam. -Listen… -Mom, who is it? -Nobody. Don't you have homework to do for tomorrow? Madam, I don't know how it was possible. But I never went in your husband's car. I swear on my dead parents. I would never… Mr. Piaggio has been like a second father to me. You must believe me. You must! I'm asking you on my knees. -Yes, get up. Please. -I am not like that. And neither is your husband. He is the best person I've ever known. And you know it. I am sure you do. I am sure. -You know it. You do! -Yes. Yes, I know. Get up. Thank you. -Enrico! What-- -You exaggerated, Cosimo. I personally came to tell you what's going on. You wanted the brand to have Reconstruction contribution, right? -But I… -I will get that financing! I talked to the Unions, the politicians, and I called Rome. Your friend, his excellency, will lose his position at the Reconstruction and I must decide whether to report you or not! Even if you report me, you still owe me money. Less than what you paid to try to screw me! Enrico. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Ralli, welcome back. -Thank you, sir. Please forgive me. -Come. Your office is waiting for you. -It's marvelous, sir! It just arrived. A big advertising hit. Suso gets full credit for it. -You should promote her. -You're right, Tadini. But the moment is a bit delicate for promoting her. -Antonella. -I missed you so much, Dad. Hi. What are you doing here? Where is Mom? Where do you think? That is excellent. I hate to admit it, but at times advertising is worth more than what you built. Yes, but it's not enough. Our objective is being in a Hollywood film like Roman Holiday. Not on the pages of a magazine. A magazine that the director will read. Or that we'll have him read. -Couldn't Panetta help you? -Yes, I think so. So what are you waiting for? -You know how these cinema people are. -Enrico. You are a person who stood in front of a convoy of Nazis. But you're also humorous, and you must exploit this quality, your brazenness. You must have this big American director choose the Vespa. It isn't so easy. Yes, but if someone can do it, that person is you, love. And not the person who wants to look like his father. The one who looks like you. Was that the carriage from the film? Wyler read my article. He was quite impressed, but hasn't decided yet. This way. And above all, Mr. Obarth hasn't decided. He takes care of the production side and his opinion is important. Please. Mr. Obarth is surely around here. There he is. It'll be done in five minutes. Three minutes. -All right. -Mr. Piaggio. I'm sorry, but I wasn't able to set up an appointment with Obarth. Shooting will begin in a few days. I don't think it's the right moment. The moment is perfect. Believe me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Good morning. -May I rent your costumes? -Of course. -You can go to my atelier. -No, I'm interested now. -No, look… -I'll return it in half an hour. Thanks. Put on what looks best and find a Vespa. See you outside. When I nod, go. See you later. He said to look for a Vespa and we'll look for a Vespa. Come, we'll choose an outfit. Go, Carla. Think of being Hepburn who is going to Gregory Peck. Go. The dress' neckline is too high! A European princess doesn't dress like a Texas oil man's wife. The skirt is too long, without sleeves. It's not possible! The problem isn't the outfit but the means of transportation. Who are you? Your cinema is one of thoroughbreds, not of gigs. What do you want? Can someone take him away? You want to put your lead roles inside a gig instead of on a horse. You are crazy. You think an American journalist in Rome rides a horse? Why not? Maybe a modern horse. You have 30 seconds? May I have them. Come. Well? What is it? A journalist and a princess on a Vespa around Rome. It was 1953 Italy was young and cheerful and the Vespa was about to become one of the most unique and popular symbols of Italian talent.
