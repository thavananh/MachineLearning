You ready to come back? - Yeah. (unsettling music) Here's the thing about euphemisms. It's like getting kicked in the balls with slippers. Softer, yeah sure, but it's still a kick in the balls. - I know that we talked about the pain probably being muscle related. But what we see is this. - [Ryan] I mean, don't get me wrong, they serve a purpose, I get it. You know sometimes they're hilarious. Sometimes. - [Nurse] Look forward. - [Ryan] Euphemisms. Here, try this one. Living with cancer. I mean that just makes it sound like a shitty roommate, you know? - The tumor has spread. Basically what I'm saying is that it's hard for me to justify continuing with the course of treatment. - [Ryan] I guess it all boils down to optimism. I mean that's what all of this comes from, right? - [Doctor] We do offer at home services. And we could offer you that for sure. - [Ryan] A silver lining, a light at the end of the tunnel. (waves crashing) (peaceful music) Living with cancer. I mean those three words, they don't sound like your body's revolting against you. They sure don't bring to mind the images of foreign bodies dissolving your own. - You doing okay sweetie? Do you need anything? - I'm good. Just feasting on my meal fit for kings. - So Steven and I have that thing tonight. But if you don't want me to go I can stay here, if you need me. - Go nuts. And have fun. You know what you should do is it's like a bar crawl. You know where you stop at every bar and take a shot. Get plastered. - Yeah right. - Be fine, Paisley'll be here. - Okay. - Hey Mom. - What? - Seriously, have fun. - [Mom] Alright, uh huh. (imitates gulping) - I've totally come to grips with the situation, by the way. I'm heading for the great beyond. I know why that sounds shitty. It's a euphemism. Death is in the air. It has its own magic. Can you feel it? (melancholy music) (muffled rock music on radio) - [Mom] Hi Steve? Hi, it's Linda. - Sorry. - Uh, hold on a second. Could you bring the tray up sweetie? - Sure. - Thanks. - So anyway about tonight, I don't think I can make it and I really am sorry. I just can't. But maybe we could do it another time. Oh great, thanks. Okay well, we'll talk soon? Alright. - And here we have the ever radiant Paisley. And she is my very own bit of sunshine. (Paisley giggles) It's like the change in the guards in flower form. - You look good today. - Right. But I appreciate you lying to my face like that. - Um hmm. - You, however, look beautiful. Glowing, like you don't have a care in the world. - Hungry? - Don't move. - What? - Don't freak out, just slowly walk backwards to me, okay? Slowly, slowly sit back down, on the bed. - What is it? - Okay, it's probably nothing. It's just, oh my god, it's gross, it's huge. - Ryan, get it off. - Relax, what it is. It's a lightning bug. - Don't do that. - [Ryan] It's a firefly. - [Paisley] That's kinda cool. - Remember when you were little, those summer nights where you'd stay out as long as possible, just chasing fireflies? Dreading the moment your parents would call you back in for the night. Whatever happened to those nights? - He's not lighting up. - Well you know it's a mating thing. No, it is. Listen, hear me out. So the female, she flashes her light and then the males flying overhead, they flash back and then they flash back and forth until da da da. - I'm me, without a light. - I just told you you glowed. Because you are my firefly. - Aw. Oh you're trying to be romantic. - Shut up. - Okay. - [Ryan] Take it somewhere nice. They only live like two months. - (laughs) I'm not gonna even ask how you know that. I'll be back. - And cross it off of my list of things to do today. - What? - [Ryan] Catching a firefly. - That wasn't on your list of things to do today. - You don't know that. - I don't. I'll be back. (uplifting music) Hey. - Hey. So which one was it today? - White rose. - [Linda] Oh. He appreciates it Paisley. - I know. So what about you? You have a date tonight? - Oh no, no, no. I had to cancel it. It's not good, time wise. Are you excited Patrick's coming? - Pat's coming? When? - [Linda] In three weeks. Ryan didn't tell you? - No, he didn't. He must've forgot. That's great. - Yeah. You know, let me do this. - No, no, no, it's okay. It's just tea, I got it. Do you want one? - Yeah, thanks. - Yeah. (rattling) (pensive music) Here you go. (heart beating) (panting) Did you eat? Ryan? - Hmm? - Did you eat anything? - No, not yet. - Well your mom wanted me to make sure you did, so. - Ah, well in that case. Umm, this food that I'm eating is so good! - Do you wanna do it now? - What, like right now? Like with my mom downstairs and, what, yeah, I mean do you think we should shut the door or? Open. - Always with the jokes, move over. You think you're funny. Ready? - You feel like home to me. (gentle reflective music) - I love watching these develop. I think it's a good one. - It's a keeper. - Ah, it's definitely a keeper. - [Ryan] He's not gonna recognize me. - Yes he will. - Yeah, I mean I know he'll recognize me, but it's not like the same me. You know? - Well I think he's nervous and scared too. - I'm not saying I'm scared. I'm just saying I don't want it to be awkward, you know what if he looks at me and then just gasps, 'cause of... - I'm sure it'll be fine. Ready? - [Ryan] Wow, look at this smile. - I know. Full service. Good job. - [Man] That's just how it is. - I'm sorry, I just can't endorse blanket statements. - Oh, here we go. - Come on, just say it. Was it crazy or what? - That was crazy. And this is next time. My man here, Pat. Can make it nice with his Barbie girlfriend. - [Man] Oh yeah. Now we're talking. - Yeah, I'm probably gonna have to skip that next one guys. - [Guys] What? - [Man] Ah, come on, why? - [Man] Come on, you gotta be kidding. - I'm going home for a few days next week. - [Man] Oh shit, you never go home. - Ooh. - [Man] He's serious, what? - It's nothing, it's just a visit. - Where are we going? - It's just a visit. - Well I guess in that case, tonight we're gonna party twice as hard. - Whoo! - [Man] Yeah. - [Man] Rebecca. - [Man] Come on. - [Woman] Come on Patrick. - [Man] You doing? - [Pat] I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. - Come on Patty. Patty, Patty, Patty. - [Ryan] It's amazing the things you appreciate when time just has the slightest bit of importance. When you don't have the option of doing it tomorrow. And the phrase, some day, loses all meaning. In a way it's like being unburdened. But see, by the time anyone realizes this gem of an idea, it's too fucking late. Think about it, I'm free to do whatever I want. And I can't do anything. (startling tone) Mom? (unsettling music) (knocking at door) - What's up buddy? - 'Sup? You back already? - Can't have your muscles all atrophy on me. I'd lose my job. - That's all it takes? Man come on, atrophy let's go, let's go. - Smart ass. - Slave driver. - Sunshine for ya? Looking good today buddy. - [Ryan] (laughs) Don't you start now. - No seriously, you do. - Not that I'm agreeing with you, 'cause I'm not. But, I feel alright. - Really? - [Ryan] Yeah. - Why do you think that is? - [Ryan] I don't know. - Sit up for me. Alright. Oop, sorry. Deep breath. Deep breath. One more. You know you're doing a lot better than most of my other clients. - Wait a second, is that supposed to make me feel better? Knowing that other people are worse off than me? That's real cheery. Hey, I mean that's an uplifter. - Hey man, you take it however you want. Let me see that. 98.6. Oh dude, brought you a present. Forgot. - Wow, you are a total dick. - I'll be back, alright? (whistling) (somber tones) (rattling) (unsettling tones) (rumbling) - What? (panting) (peaceful music) - You okay? - Yeah, yeah yeah. These just fell of the desk. - You sure? - Yeah, yeah, just startled me is all. - [Nurse] Okay. Well, got your grub here. Your mom's taking a nap downstairs so I get to be the one to make sure that you eat it. - I'm really not that hungry. - Dude, you gotta eat. Gotta take your pills. You know the drill. - Yeah, I guess I do. - [Nurse] Two of these. - People believe all over the world that tragedy is God's will. If an Indian man's wife dies, God's will. If a kid in Africa gets AIDS, that is God's will. You know we have to have reasons for things we don't understand. But what if maybe, just maybe all of it is just a shitty bit of luck. Why not? You know I look at what's happening to me and all I can think is, I must have done something wrong, somewhere. We were brought up thinking that our negative condition is owed to our sinful ways. What about the outstanding citizen who never drinks or smokes, never breaks the law, only to get killed by a drunk driver? What we're really asking is why me? You know the only answer I can come up with is... Why not? Paisley has hope. Sometimes I think it's all she has. I mean hope is just another word for God. And I don't have either. (sighs) So where does that leave me? - [Paisley] So are you excited? - Yeah, I don't know. - Come on, it's your best friend. - Yeah, I wouldn't wanna see me like this. - Hun, you look fine. - I'm not talking about me. Alright, I'm talking about him. You see me every day. I mean Pat hasn't seen me in months. - Pat's a grown male adult. I'm sure he can take care of himself. You trying to make him feel better is not gonna change anything. (car door slams) He's here. (hopeful music) If it's any consolation he looks as nervous as you do. - It's 'cause he knows what this is. (knocking at door) - Patrick! - I love you. - Hey. - Look at you! - How are you? - Oh you look so good. Oh I've missed you. - I've missed you too. - Hey you. - Hey! - Someone's getting all the attention, huh? - Paisley. You look beautiful. - Oh thanks. - [Linda] How was your drive? - Ah, it was long, but traffic was okay so it wasn't too bad. - [Linda] Good, do you want something to drink? - Oh, no, I'm fine. Is Ryan upstairs? - Upstairs, yes, go, go. (laughs) Oh I'm so glad he's here. - Yeah, me too. - Wow. (laughs) How much exactly are you spending on those acting classes? - Uh, too much. - Alright, I'll make it easy for ya. I'm gonna play out the scene as it should go. Alright. You walk in and you say, hey man, how ya feeling? And then I'll say, ah you know hanging in. Then you'll reply, you're looking good. You know not nearly as good as your girl downstairs. To which I'm gonna come back with stay away from my mom dude. - You're still an asshole. - [Ryan] You're still a dick. - Hey, guess what I brought? - Oh wow. I cannot believe that you kept this man. - Are you kidding? Of course I did. And you're up. - I mean. (slow, thoughtful music) Weird, right? - Yeah. - They're videos that I'm making for people. Still working on yours. - Right. Picture a day? - Yeah. Yeah, you know it's Pais. Man. Not the script you would have written for us, huh? - Alright, what do we got? - Uh, I don't know. - Nice. - Nice. - Have you ever had a garden? - Yes, my parents pretty much have like a little farm in their backyard. - Oh that's so... - They have chickens and everything. - Really? - [Pat] Cha-ching. - [Ryan] Oh. - [Pat] As you requested. - Merci. - [Pat] So you're sneaking alcohol by your mom again? - Just like old times man. - Yeah but, are you even allowed to drink? I mean I don't know, aren't you on a bunch of pills and junk? - Ah, it's for Pais, you know, I wanna do something special. - [Pat] Let me get that. - Thanks. I wanted to share a drink with my best friend. - Wine in coffee cups. We're still class act. - Oh yeah. - (laughs) Oh I got too much. Will you take more? Nice. There we go. To the times we've had. - To us. (sad music) I guess I had no idea. - He missed you. - I know, I know. It's just with work and all, and... It was, just got a little. It was. Yeah, I gotta go. Okay. - You okay? - [Ryan] Yeah. - Wanna talk about it? - [Ryan] No. - Dance with me. - What? - [Paisley] You heard me, come on. - I can barely walk right now. I can't get outta bed and dance. - You can and you will. And I'm gonna start it here. And we're gonna dance to whatever comes on. - (scoffs) No we're not. - [Paisley] Yes we are. - I don't even know if that thing will play. - Well if it doesn't play then we'll dance to silence. Okay? I'm gonna start it. ("They're Calling" by Setting Sun) Oh yeah, this'll work, come on. Get into it, come on. Move. (laughs) Come on. Come on, ready. You can do it, I totally know. Let's go. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. (Ryan moans) - Wow. - Wow what? - No, I feel like an idiot. - [Paisley] That's good, 'cause you look like an idiot too. Thank you. For dancing with me. That was perfect. Something on my to do list. - We can cross that one off then. (gentle music) You're welcome. (sighs) Well this is it. Out of all the things we had planned for ourselves, all the adventures, all the craziness. All the success. It got cut short. It's all on you man. At least we got to say goodbye, right? (scoffs) I love you bro. - Um, you feel good. - [Ryan] That's 'cause you like snuggles. - I love snuggles. - (clears throat) Okay. You weren't supposed to see that. - Yeah, what is this? I'm not laughing, it's not funny. - [Ryan] It's kinda funny. - It's not funny. - (laughs) Relax, look, it was supposed to be a surprise for you. For us, for our date. - [Paisley] A date? - My mom's going out with Steve tonight, so I figured. - I'm not gonna sleep with you. - Oh, I was thinking more dinner and a movie. Right here. - This dinner? - Well and you know we could get drunk afterwards. - Uh uh, I don't think so. Not with your pills and everything, I don't think it's a good idea. - [Ryan] Wait a second, relax. It's gonna be fine, alright? Please? - Why do you do that? - Hmm? You can have whatever you want. I mean Hungarian, French, Cantonese, Thai, I don't know, and you pick pizza? - [Paisley] This girl wants pizza. - The girl want pizza. - Thanks for mocking me, that was nice. - Um hmm. - That's good. - Well, then your wish is my command. - [Linda] Hey guys. - Oh Mom, just uh, - Oh sorry. - throw a warning flare or something. - Sorry. I was thinking maybe we could rent a movie tonight. Maybe we could make some popcorn. - (sighs) What happened to you going out with Steve? So what, you just called him up and said sorry Steve. No go, again? I wanna spend more time with my son, again, 'cause he's not here long and God knows, he can have peace when he's dead. - I enjoy spending time with you. - I know Mom, that's the problem. Is all you wanna do is spend time with me. - Well I'm sorry. I love you, I... - Oh come on. Don't do that. Don't try to make me feel guilty, alright? All I'm saying is treat me like an adult, alright? I can take care of myself. - I understand that. - No you don't. - [Linda] You're not the only one going through this. - Neither are you! You going out one night isn't gonna kill me any faster. - Got it. (somber music) - She's gotta stop doing this. - Linda? (sobs) He didn't mean it. - I forget sometimes that this is harder for him than it is for me. I just. Oh I just wanted us... to spend some time together. - I know you do. - Sorry. - I just think he really needs a little less time too. You know? - Yes, of course. - And you need your time too though. You need to get out, need a break. - Yeah. - Go do something fun, something crazy. - Okay. Crazy. Oh look at me, I'm a mess. - Oh. Nothing we can't fix, right? - Thanks sweetie. - Ready? - Yeah. - Three, two, one. Do you love it. - Oh, you did a great job. - It looks nice, right, it's very natural. You look beautiful. - You're so good. Well I knew that, looking at you, but you don't wear make up. Oh my gosh. Thank you. - You're very welcome. - (mumbles) again, granted I don't die or anything. See you. Can't believe you actually talked her into going. - I just told her the truth. Why do you make these? - It helps me bleed it out, I guess. Everybody wants to leave something, right? - You know when you talk to me, no jokes, no sarcasm, just talk to me? You tell me some of the most amazing things. It's just if you'd open up to others the way that you do me, I really think these could have an effect on people. (thunder rumbles) - It's a sign. (Paisley chuckles) - What about this one? - Whatever you want. - [Paisley] I wanna watch something funny. - Then pick something funny. (knocking at door) - Hi. Steven wanted to say hello. - Oh yeah, come on in. - Hey man. How ya feeling? - You know, good. - Yeah, well we, just wanted to say hi before we head out. - Great, yeah. No, you kids have fun tonight. - Well, I'll do my best. (Linda chuckling) - Whoa. - Whoa. - Okay, I think I have. There we go. You have a candle, something? - [Paisley] Yeah, no, we have a couple. - [Steve] No, no keep it. You may need it again. - [Paisley] Thank you. - So we're gonna go now. - You know unless you need us to stay, 'cause we can always order in. - [Linda And Paisley] No. - I'm sure that's fine. I know where the flashlights are. Everything's gonna be fine. - Alright, I'll catch you soon pal. Alright, you kids be good. - Have fun. - [Steve] Okay. (somber music) - It sounds nice, huh? It's calming. You falling asleep on me? What? - It's just... When you leave at night, I lie here waiting for the sound of the gate. And your car door. The sound of you driving away. That's how I feel alone time. Like I'm alone in my room. Just waiting for something to happen. - [Steve] It's a monsoon. - I know. Here, give me the ice cream. - Here, take that. - [Steve] Ah, ah, hurry. (both laughing) - [Linda] Wow. - Wow, it just won't let up. - I know. I took the vanilla, right? - Yes. - Yeah. - You took the vanilla, put that there. Umm. - Oh this looks so good. - Oh, it does. Um, wow. Well. I did have this whole dessert in the park thing planned. - [Linda] This is perfect. I'm so glad I came out tonight. - You know, Ryan actually called me. And told me that if you tried to cancel to not take no for an answer. - He didn't. - Yes, he did. The thing is, my daughter said the same thing the other day. Yeah. - Funny how that happens. When we stop taking care of our kids and they start taking care of us. I forget that sometimes. - Yeah. (sighs) I do too. (hopeful music) ("My heart's a Machine" by Astoria Kings) ♪ Never gonna lose my place ♪ ♪ I'm burning up so hot and clean ♪ ♪ This heart's a machine ♪ (gentle music) (humming) - Hey! - Hey. - Uh, you know I'm gonna. - Yeah, I'm gonna. You do that. - Oh okay. (pensive music) (creaking) (unsettling music) (heart beating) (yells out in pain) - Ryan. What, what, what? What's wrong? - [Ryan] Can't hear. - What, what's wrong? Linda, I need your help! - Please. I can see it. I can see it there. - [Paisley] Linda! Get up. - I can't feel. (voices muffled) Ah, make it stop. - Hang on. Where does it hurt, what's wrong? Where's the pain at, what's going on? Linda! - [Ryan] Make it stop. - [Paisley] It's alright, I'm here. Linda? (machine beeping) - So, the tumor is pressing on his spine. They got him on steroids, but it's hard. I don't think he's gonna be able to walk again. - Is he hurting? - No, I don't think so. But they have him on morphine, just to be sure. - Can I see him? - Yeah sure, yeah I think he's awake. - Go ahead. - Hi sweetie. Hi. - I love you Mom. I don't tell you enough. - I love you too sweetie. (thoughtful music) - Living with cancer. That was conjured up by people who can't face the truth. Made for us poor bastards who are forced to face it kicking and screaming. And the worst part is they want us to cling to stupid things like hope. Trying to fool us into believing that God actually gives a shit. That we're not just gonna rot from the inside out and that everything has a purpose. Well I'm sick of it. I'm not just gonna sit here and buy into it like some idiot. Cancer has taken everything from me that I care about. I haven't learned a god damn thing lying in this fucking bed except that this is where the sidewalk ends. There's no secret, there's no great epiphany. Just pain, grief and loss. Hellish fucking loss. Anything that I had that was good is now total shit. So fuck you God. The worst part is the look on Paisley's face, seeing me like this. I'm just bringing her down. (slightly energetic music) (pants) - Hey baby. Okay, so today I'm thinking goofy. Not really goofy, but kind goofy. Just... Where are the pictures? - Burned 'em. - What do you mean? - I mean I got rid of them. - What? - [Ryan] I didn't want 'em around. - So you just? - I don't wanna be remembered like that Paisley. I don't want you to ever think of me like that, like some nagging, depressing memory. - They were ours. - I don't want a bunch of pictures of me dying laying around, alright? Let it go. - Let it go? (sighs) I'm trying to deal with this too, you know? - You don't have to Paisley. There's no happy ending here. - [Paisley] You're just scared. - I'm not scared. Okay, I'm not scared. Stop saying that. I'm just through. Through with the bullshit, with you, with everything, with you coming here every day. - You just think that because I'm here. - I'm not a fucking firefly Paisley. I'm not gonna light up or do whatever it is that you think I'm gonna do. - Asshole. (stifles a sob) (screams) (sobs) (gentle, sad music) - Oh, I woke you. - No, I was just resting. - I keep pulling photos from the album thinking that they should be framed. (laughs) I guess I should just leave it in my room, huh? - Nah, it's fine. What do you got? - [Linda] You hated that jacket. - No I didn't. - You did, you kept cutting holes in it. What a cut up. She loves you so much. I don't think that's ever gonna change. Hmm. I'll let you get some sleep. (wind howling) (phone ringing) - Thank you for calling Bradley's Flowers, can I help you? Uh yeah, no problem. About 20 minutes. Thanks. - Hey buddy, how you doing man? Let's take a listen to you first, before we do anything else, alright man? Get you to jump up here. Alright? Deep breath. It's nobody's fault, you know? Room feels empty. - Can't believe he did that. - I wasn't talking about the pictures. - Hey Eddie? - Yeah? - Um... He's seeing things you know. - What kinda things? - I don't know, he won't talk to me about it. I just catch him staring and reacting to things and... - Well, I know it's hard to understand, but morphine does that sometimes. It can distort things. I used to take care of this old lady once, named Beth. She was super sweet. She swore that she could smell flowers. Roses, lilacs, jasmine. It's all she'd ever talk about. There wasn't one flower in that place. - That's sad. - Yeah, well, when she died I went back to her place to pick my stuff up, you know? And I'll be damned if I couldn't smell flowers. You know no matter what happens, everything's gonna be alright in the end. - You really believe that? - Yeah, yeah I do. - If you don't want me here? - Of course I want you here. I'm sorry. (gentle music) I'm so... I'm so sorry. It's my fault. I just didn't know what to do. I'm so scared. - [Paisley] It's okay. It's okay. (labored breathing) - Hang in there bro. So, I don't think he's feeling any pain right now. But, I'm actually surprised how lucid he is with the amount of morphine he's on. But it's close. (melancholy music) - I love you, you know. Baby, there's nothing there. It's just me. It's just me. (gentle peaceful music) It's okay baby, go ahead. - I love you. - I love you too. - [Ryan] An angel told me to make these my own. To try and be positive and find the light in the dark. And I guess you could say I found my own silver lining. I sort of entered light in my waning hours. It's not any great epiphany or anything. It's just so obvious. Just to realize that every single moment matters. Take the time to notice the fireflies in your life. And if you can somehow change the life of one, just one, you change the life of plenty. - They say that we remember those who don't run the longest, but the brightest. I don't know if I cry for myself or him. Or all the things that we won't get to do. Probably all of the above. - [Ryan] It's in front of us all the time and we just, we never see it. - But I know he's here. - [Ryan] The secret to life? Live it. - [Paisley] He's with me.
