You have to see it. - Okay, all right. Just keep things buttoned down,less than five minutes away. - Roger. - Arnold, give me a hand. - Yes sir. - Boy, did I scare you guys. - Yeah, so what did it win, you jerk? - Satisfaction, and that's plenty good enough. - Leslie, grow up. - Hey, are you guys gonna cut class today? - I am, Jeff Elkascored some great weed.

Hang on just a second. - Queen? - Say Carol, check out our new Sister. - Thank you. - You bet. - Julie ain't no Sister yet, Kitty. - Well, she's past everytest you've given her. - For your information, Leslie, I'm far from finished with her initiation. Well, I see Doug still brands his animals. - Ooh! {laughing) - You stick my milk? - I never saw Steve act that way when you were with him. - Yeah, well that's why I dumped him. - I thought he dumped you. - Well, you thought wrong. Besides, I never really cared for that jerk anyway. - Oh no? - Oh my God, a straw. - Then why are you putting Julie through all this? You're jealous. - Kitty, shut up! And take that stupidthing out of your mouth. She's wanted to be a Sister long before me and Steve split up. - Well, it sure seems like a lot of trouble for someone you don't even want in. - It's no trouble at all. Besides, I have a new test for her tonight, and this one will for sure be the one. - The body of famed Russian psychic, Karl Raymarseivich, or Raymar, as he came to be known, is about to be entombed here. But the feeling among those with me here today is not one of mourning, but of mystery, curiosity and anger. That anger coming from the close friends of the girls who were found dead - Here they come. - In Raymar'sapartment two days ago. - Get away. - Mrs. McKenna. - Mrs. McKenna. - Get through to the limo! - Mrs. McKenna! - Are you Olivia McKenna, Raymar's daughter? - Please, not now. - Do you have any idea why your father murdered those girls? - There's no proof that he murdered them. Please, no questions. - Since none of the girls were sexually or physically abused, do you have any theory on what happened? - My wife said no questions, please. - Mrs. McKenna! Excuse us, let us through. - One question please. Please, let us through. - Mrs. McKenna!- Mrs, McKenna! - Mrs. McKenna!- Mrs, McKenna! - All right, all right, ooh, ooh. - Unfortunately, not much is known about Raymar's life in recent years, for hehad become a recluse. Karl Raymar died of an apparent heart attack, but the bizarre condition of his apartment and the true cause of death of the missing girls remains a mystery at this hour. Larry Kel reporting for KTIV News. - Come on, let's go. Olivia, Olivia, are you all right? - I just feel so-- - I know this thing is very tough on you. - Allan, I'm so sorry you got dragged into this. - Honey, why don't we get a breath of fresh air? - But I wanna at least say goodbye to him. - Why? Okay. We'll come back afterthe service, all right? - Okay. - Come on, come on. - All my life, you've kept me away. I wish I could have helped you. - Let's go, honey. We'll go straight home,you'll feel better. - Yes, yes I'd like that. - Got it! - Hey you! - Kiss me real quick. - You're coming with me. - What's wrong with it? - I don't know. - Hit it again! - Get in! Poor baby, I'll kiss it and make it better. And you said you were chicken. - Steve? - Hmm? - What do you want more than anything else? - To take off our clothes and dive in the ocean. - No, come on! Seriously. - Is this career guidance? - Come on. - I don't know, besides you, who I do have. - You egotist. - I guess to make the USC team when I graduate, why? - So being part of a group or team is important to you. - Julie, let's not argue about this Sisters thing again. - Look, I've got to prove I can do it. - Why? They're such jerks, You can belong to any group at school. - I want to prove I cantake their initiation. - Julie, they're just accepting you so Carol can torment you. She's so jealous of you! All she wants to do is show how weak and chicken you are. - Yeah, and that's all the more reason why I won't back down! - Listen, I didn't mean you are, I just think it's stupidto go down to her level. Hey, come on! I mean, you don't have to prove anything to anyone. - Yes I do, I'm tiredof being called a pansy! All I ever hear is "Julie's such a nice girl, "Julie's such a nice girl." - What's wrong with that? - You don't understand. - Oh, heyJulie, where you going? - I'm going to walk home! - Julie! Julie! Julie! - Allan. Allan. - I'll handle this. Can I help you? - Are you Olivia Raymar? - I'm Olivia McKenna. - But Karl Raymar is or was, your father? - What do you want here? - Mrs. McKenna, my nameis Samuel Dockstader and I'm a feature writer for The World Of The Occult. I wanna talk to you,concerning your father. - All right fella, get off my property. I'm not gonna ask again. - No Allan, it's all right. - I was once very close with him. - Oh please, please come in. - What your father did Olivia, was due to an obsessionwith his work. - His work? - Do you know anything about bio-energy? It's the electromagnetic force in all living things. It can be photographed with Kirlian photography. Every living thing contains bio-energy in varied degrees. - Allan. - I don't see how that means anything. - When I first met your father Olivia, I was very overwhelmed with his ability to move objects with his mind. Karl Raymar was one of the only true practitioners of telekinesis in the world. - But I was raised by myfamily to believe that he was-- - He was a fake. No, no, your father was no fake, he was a genius in his field until ... - What? - There is a phenomenon, it's called psychic vampirism. Have you ever known anyone who's left you feeling physically drained of energy? - Yes. - Most people who are psychic vampires and do this to youdon't even recognize it. Raymar found that he could drain the bio-energy from things and then use that power to move, or levitate, objects. - You mean that my father drained those girls of life? - He didn't mean to. He would pick up a hitchhiker and then take them to his apartment. He would there frighten hisvictim to an incredible degree. Then he would drain the energy from the adrenalinethat he had stimulated. He wouldn't listen to me, it was a negative energythat he was dealing with and valuable power is what killed him. - Oh brother. - Olivia. Your father allowed himself to die. Listen to this in private. The tapes from my research associate, he conducted some studies with your father. - Mom, can you get that? - Why can't you? - Mom, please. - All right, all right! - Is Carol home? - She's upstairs. I thought we weren't gonna be seeing you anymore, Steve. - I just need to talk to her for a minute, please. - All right, but don't be long. She still has todo her homework. - She still has to do her homework. Hi, Steve. What a surprise. - Yeah, I'm sure it is. - Well, what's the matter? - Oh, knock it off, I'mfed up with your games. Now if you're mad about our breakup, you take it out on me. - Steve, I have nothing against you. I really wish it couldaworked out between us. - But since it didn't, you started taking it on Julie. - Julie's wanted to be in The Sisters for a long time. - Oh, right. - She has to go through initiation just like anybody wouldwho wants to join. - Carol, how dumb do you think I am? I know The Sisters consist of you three. - We're expanding. - Listen, I don't wanna hear anymore about any initiations, is that clear? Now, you understand me? Well, I gotta go, I gotbasketball practice. - Steve, I miss you. - Your mom's downstairs. - I don't care. I wanna be with you again, I'll do anything you want. She wouldn't do that for you. - I gotta go. - Mom? Hello. I'll be gone till Sunday night, don't forget to clean the oven. Great. Wells residence. - Wells residence. - Hi Carol. - Are you ready for your final test, soon-to-be Sister? - Sure. - Good, I'll be over in 20 minutes. Oh, and bring a sleeping bag, it's gonna be an all nighter. See ya. - She said she was coming. - That's what she said. - Come on! - What is that girl doing now? - Hi, here's my sleeping bag, I guess I'm all set. - Oh, and so are we. Get in the back, girl. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. - Boy, do you want one of these, huh? - Yeah, that would be great. - Well, after tonight, you could have one. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's book up. - What's the big rush? - I wanna get there before it closes, nerdle-brain. - Nerdle-Brain, very nice. - Hey, where's Steve tonight? - I don't know, basketball practice I guess. - Have you talked to him? - No. - Good. - Where are we going? - Oh, um, you'll see, just relax okay? - Olivia, look what you're doing to yourself. You're all worked up over this Dockstader character. Forget him, will you dear? He's a kook, it's plainand simple, Olivia. How could you have believed anything he said? He's just some nut. - I don't think he is, Allan. I have a very strong feeling about those dreams I've been having again, those images. - Don't start with that ESP crap again. You promised you'd stop all of that. We've been through this before. Look, I'm sorry I was rude to Dockstader, but all of that Raymar. - He was my father! - I'm sorry, okay? - All my life, he stayed away from me. Allan. - Oh, where's that deposition? I wish you'd tell me what's really wrong. - Nothing. - You're so quiet. - I was just thinking. I'm all right, really. - So I'm supposed tostay out here all night? - Now come on, Julie. How mean do you think we are? It's cold and damp out here at night. - You mean I'm not staying out here. - Of course not, you'restaying in there. - Mausoleum? - Uh-huh. Here you go. After tonight, you'll be an official Sister. - You ain't scared, are you? - No, I was just thinking-- - Liar. - Hey, we've been generous. We could've made youspend the night out here with the worm-infested bodies. - But no. - You'll be safe and warm, locked in, protected inside. Also, it's a higher class of people in there. We figured you'dappreciate that. - And here, here's some downers. Now, if you can't go to sleep, you just take a couple of those,they'll put you right out. They're just so that you don't think you hear things. - Sister, are we makingthis easy for you? Oh, and here's a flashlight. - I say she doesn't wanna do it. - Course she does, she wants to be a Sister. - She ain't going in, that's it, let's go. - No, now come on. Let's be fair, we'll all count to ten. If Julie here hasn't gottenout and gone in, then we'll go. We'll take this chickenhome and that'll be it. No chance of ever being a Sister. Think of all the gossip that'll go around school. - Hey, that sounds fair to me. Here. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. - Okay, you're gonna have to stay until they open up in the morning and you won't be able to get out. We'll be back in the morning to make sure you stayed in there all night long. You'll be surrounded by the dead, nothing but dead bodies. - We're closed. You gotta leave right now to the main gate. Anybody still in here? - Let's go, come on. - I miss you,I'm sorry that you died. I wish you'd come back to me and mommy, I love you. - Come on baby. - I'm sorry. - Come one, Breaker, weon for tonight or not? - I don't know, I gotta make a call. - Well make it, I'llmeet you in the showers. Breaker, that's not an invite. - Hey, we looked good out there, huh? - Yeah. - Oh God! - Julie? Julie? - It's been a long day, time to hit the sack. You coming upstairs? - I'll be right up, I just wanna finish this chapter. - Okay. - This tape is a summary of my notes for Samuel Dockstader concerning the Karl Raymar experiments, which I must admit, I found quite astounding but ultimately frightening. During the telekinesis experiments, there were time's when Raymar's mental force was so great, you could actually see a discharge of energy. Once, when we were trying to make a photograph of the energy flash, it reflected off a mirror in the lab and broke some equipment. It was that strong, that powerful. Raymar was able to create the effect at will. - Boy, are we gonna scare this girl good. - So what makes you so sure the window latch is still broken, huh? - 'Cause, my brother was there no more than three weeks ago and they were pledging those new fraternity guys, they broke it. - Yeah, so, what'd they do in there? - I don't know, my brother never tells me nothing. I think they made that pledge stay in there, then they snuck in later through that broken window. - So, did the dude stayin there all night? - Hell no, they scared his ass out so fast. - All right! - Wait, what if we get caught in there? - Who's gonna catch us? - I don't know. What was that pill you gave Julie? - Demerol. She's gonna be so messed up, she won't know what's going on. Well, what's the big deal? - Well, I don't like it. - So? - So, I just don't like it. - Then you're not coming? - I don't know. - You know, I ought to pullover right now and let you out. - Yeah, why don't you? - Kitty, open the doorand let this turkey out. - So then what, you're really gonna let me out here, huh? - You named it, you claimed it. Open the door! - What Kitty, you're going with her, huh? - She sure as hell is, she's a real Sister. Come on, Kitty, shut thedoor, we're out of here. Geeze. Gimme the sack. - Look out. - Okay, let's get up to that mother. - What's that? - Okay okay, I'm going. I'm going, I'm moving, I'm up, okay. Okay, okay. - Do me a favor. Don't stop to sight see anymore. - Lucy, have you seen Carol tonight? - No. - Hello Mrs. Mason. This is Steve, is Carol there? Yeah, I know it's late, it-- She's at Leslie's? All three of them? Okay thank you, I'm sorry to bother you. Goodnight. Lucy, do you know a Leslie Winslow? - Yeah. - Do you have her number? - Yeah. - Could you give it to me? - Sure, but it wouldn'tdo you any good. - Why? - 'Cause she's not home. - Well, how do you know? - 'Cause she just lefthere a few minutes ago. Boy, is she mad at Carol. - For what? - Who knows? Stopped by looking for Doug, said Carol's a sicko and left. - Do you know where she went? - I guess she's walking home. She lives about a miledown Greenfield Avenue. - Did she say anything about Julie? - Who? - Never mind, thanks. - Hey, I thought you and Carol broke up. - We did. - Oh. - Later on, Raymar worked with some small laboratory animals. By touching them, he could actually drain the life from them. Then he would animate them, that is, not bring them back to life, but move them with his mind to startlethe other animals. It was shocking to realize what this man was capable of, literally the power of life and death. He seemed obsessedwith trying to discover the actual experience of dying. - I remember, my brother said they got in through the back. This looks like it. Ready? - I guess so. - all right. Let's get her. Now what? - Nothing, I'm just checking it out. - Would you come on? - Aww! - What? - I think I hurt my foot. - Great. - No, it's all right. It's all right. - Ooh, scary. - You ain't never lied. - Now, we gotta be really quite. I don't want her to findus before we find her. - Hey, wait! What's that? - Come on. Over here. Where the hell is she? - Maybe she left. I would have. - Look! Gee, you're emotional. Julie. Come on. It's her. - How do you know it's her? - Who else would be breathing in here besides us? Come on. - What are we gonna do first? - First, we gotta wake her up. - Julie! Oh Julie! Julie! Julie! Here she comes. This gook is the best. Did you see that? Right on her neck. - Remember that Peter Lorre film where the hand got it. - Cut that out! You should take that thing down there and see if you can hit her in the face. - All right, what are you gonna do? - I'll be right here when you chase her back this way. - Cool. - Wow, that was fantastic, we sure couldn't have planned that one better. - Yeah, you sure scared her. - Now we got her going so she'll start seeing things on her own. - Hey where's Julie? - Why are you asking me? - Why do you think? - I guess she's still in there. - In where? - It wasn't my idea, okay? - In where, huh? - Well, they're initiating her. - Damn it, Leslie, now, where are they? - They're in the mausoleum. Look, we really didn't think she was gonna do it! - Listen, so you mean she's out in the cemetery somewhere? - No. She's inside the mausoleum. - What? - I told Carol the wholething was really stupid, but she had to go inthere and terrorize her. - Damn her. Stupid. - It was some sort of broken window they were gonna sneak in through. Watch out. - Listen, come on. - What do you mean come on? - Well you're gonna show me where it is. - No! No way, I'm not going in that place. If you wanna go, you go, Hugo. - Thanks a lot. Those guys are in a lot of trouble now. - Doingsome hereditary studies, we found that members of the same family often possess similar psychic powers, even children raised apart from the parents may be capable of psychic abilities. When I asked about Raymar's daughter, he almost violently,refused to discuss her. His reaction wasstrange, strong, almost protective in a way. The children can often have psychic abilities and not realize what they are. It may be worth testing the daughter at some time. Considering thestrength of his powers, it would be interestingto follow up on. - Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be they name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. And give us this day, our daily bread, forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the ... - Hey Carol, here's her stuff. Wouldn't it be really funny if we were to plant the stuff around. - Hey, it looks like a new arrival. - Hey, what are you doing? - Wait a second. I just wanna take a look. Well, what's the matter? - All this stuff reminds me of when my uncle died. Funerals are weird. - Mm, this one sure smells fresh. - Don't do that! - Do you prefer yourcorpses fresh or rotted? Karl Raymarseivich. Raymar? Wow. - Who's he? - You haven't heard about this weirdo? He could move things with his mind. You know, tele, tele-something. Anyway, they found a whole bunch of dead girls in his apartment. Real bizarre guy. - He could really move things with his mind? - Of course not. My dad said he was a fake. - Why's that cracked? - I don't know. Maybe he wants out! Hey, guess what. I still have half a joint in my pocket. - You wanna smoke it right here? - Well sure, why not? Who's gonna bust us? This is definitely better than that last smoke. - Uh-Uh. - Why do you alwayschew on that toothbrush? - I don't know, I guess I just like the way it tastes. - Oh well, let's get back to business. Hey sicko, want a hit? Come on. It's Julie! Come on, let's spread out. - Spread out? - Yeah, I'll go thisway and you go that way. - But Carol -- - Let me out! Please! - Hey Kitty. Kitty? Kitty? Kitty? Kitty? Why did you do that? Take that stupid thing off. - Sorry. - Did you see what she did to that chapel? She tore it up! She must've gone crazy. - Oh, let's get out of here. - Okay. - Girl, let'sbook out of this place. - No, no. - Julie! - Whatever Raymar's powers or capabilities were, the temptation for him to use them wrongly seemed to have been great. You could sense an evilpresence about him. His special abilities and powers made me very afraid of what the man was capable of in this life, or even in death. - Mausoleum. The mausoleum. Show me the mausoleum. - Let's get out of here. Let's try to get out the front door! Somebody! Somebody! - Carol! Carol, I'm so scared. How are we gonna get out? - I don't know. - There's gotta beanother way out of here. - Maybe we can find something to break a window. - What about one of those chairs from that funeral down the hall? - Good idea! - Olivia, what happened? - I'm going back there, back to the mausoleum. - Why? - I've got to stop him. - Who? - My father, Allan. There are things you don't understand and there's no time to explain. - Olivia. - Don't try to stop me. - Do you realizehow crazy this sounds? Olivia. Olivia, you can't keep on with this. - I have to, Allan. - Oh no, Kitty, no. - Get away. - Come on, we gotta get out of here. - I feellike a - No Kitty, we gotta go. Come on. Come on. - Just a minute, please. - Carol! - No, no, no! - He's gone! - Kitty. Oh no. - Open this door, open this door! Open it, open it! - It's all right, Julie. You're safe now. Everything will be all right. - It wasn't, it wasn't. - No, now look. It was all a prank. It was Carol and Kitty, they've been scaring you. - No, not them. - Julie, listen to me. It's just those stupid girls, that's all. But it's over now. I'm here. You're safe. You're safe, okay? - Okay. - Let's get out of here. - Julie! Julie no! - No! I don't fear you. You're all right. You'll be fine. He'll be okay. Let's get him up.
