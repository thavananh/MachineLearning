Well, if you do, could you just do me a solid and, uh, be wary of the traps? Should be totally fine, you know, cos they're signposted. But, uh, they're close to the track in case you wanna run off for a mimi. - OK. - Almost killed all the goats. They do untold damage to the bush. You wouldn't realize it, eh, but if you compared goated land to ungoated land, well, you'd be surprised. Walking on your own, eh? - Yeah. - Oh, well, I'll leave you to it, eh? - Ow. - I'll line it up, babe. - OK. Perfect. That'll work. - Sweet. All right. - OK. So... - So, let's... - I reckon... get me when I'm, like, going up. - OK, I'll try my best. Promise. - OK. Three, two, one. Go! No, I didn't think so. Let's do it again, and then make sure, like, it kind of looks natural. I kind of wanna make it to look like I'm going into the bush. OK? - OK. Sounds amazing. - So, one, two, three. - Go with it way more. - Oh my... Austin! - What? - How can you say that's a good photo when my-- the frond is over my face?! - Amazing. That's the reason why it's good. OK? - You're the pits. Look at it! - Hot! - There's some good ones... - Yeah? - Babe. Are you kidding me? Look at that! - Oh, God. Oh, God. - Oh, golly, gosh. - Motoring ahead. - What? - Motoring ahead. - Ah. - Wow. - Crazy. - This is... - Nice. - Wait. Hang on. What is...? Babe, look at this! Look. Look at this. Look at the color of these. - Awesome. - Oh! Oh, they don't really smell much. Wow. This place... so beautiful. Smell that. Sort of a smell? Not really, though, hey? - Hey, mate. - Oh! - Sorry. Did I frighten you, bro? - I didn't know anyone else was-was here. - Oh. Yeah, I'm pretty light on my feet. Hold on. Where are you going? - Oh, I've got to-- I've gotta keep going. - You gotta keep--? I mean, you only just sat down. I saw ya. I first saw you about half an hour ago, actually. You were quite far ahead of me, but I said, "You know what? "I'm gonna catch that guy, and I'm gonna track him down." Here we are 15 minutes later. Found ya. Well, you'd stopped, but still, not bad. Ah! Agua. Water. I'm Nicky, by the way. - Oh. Uh, nice to meet you. - Am I gonna hear your name, bro, or...? - Uh... Ian. - Uh Ian? Well, it's good to meet you, Uh Ian. It's your first time up here? - Yeah. - Yeah. Big on hiking, though? - Uh... not really. - And yet here we are on one of the biggest tracks in the entire country. That's bold, Ian. - Um, I'm gonna keep going. - Oh, yeah. Cool. I'll come with ya. - Oh, you don't have to do that. - Yeah. It'd be fun. I don't mind. - No, no, you don't have-- you don't have to come with me. - Don't have to do a lot of things I do, but I do 'em because I like 'em. - No, honestly, it's fine. You rest, and I'll-- - Nah. I've done enough resting. I'll tell you what. You set the pace. OK? We go as slow as you want. I'm going so fast. Quite enjoy just the peace and the quiet. You know, just me and the bush. And you. Me, Ian and the bush. Come on. I kind of bounce around, d'you know what I mean? From place to place. Always, you know, doing little different bits and pieces at different spots. I guess they kind of call it innovation nowadays, don't they? I think it's something like that. But I don't think your job title should be what defines you as a person. You know what I mean? Ian, do you know what I mean? - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh! Watch your feet. That's it. That's better. You really gotta lift over these roots. You don't wanna get caught on anything. Imagine spraining your ankle out here. - Y-You go... - Huh? - You go first. - Oh, no, you go. - You go first. - Nah, honestly. Go for it. Good man. Anyway, you've gotta do what you've gotta do to earn a crust. What do you do? Some kind of administration, reception or something? You're a secretary somewhere? - No. - Hospitality? You serve drinks and that? - No. - Right. Retail? Selling clothes? - No. I... - Selling some kind of a product. - I had my own business. - You had your own business? - Yeah. - Oh. Yeah, no, I was gonna say that one next, obviously, but... Huh. Wait, hold on. You had your own business? - Yeah. - You don't have it anymore? - No. - What happened? - Oh, listen, I'm just gonna go... I just gotta go, um... - What? - I just gotta go... - What? What, you need to take a slash? - Yeah. - Oh, right. - Yeah. - Well, just go here. I'll turn around. So I found all the texts, got all the grisly details, and that's when I ended it. Honestly, it was any guy. Like, any guy. Even old guys. Do you wanna go ahead of me? - No. - You do? - No. - You can if you want to. - No, I don't. - Doesn't matter anyway. We made it. - The light's on. - Well, yeah, there'll be other campers there. Maybe even a couple of honeys, if you know what I mean. One for you, one for me. Unless there's more than two of them-- maybe two for me, one for you. - I might carry on to the next hut. - The next hut's a day's walk away. - Yeah. - Well, you'll die of exposure, ya twit. Come on. - OK, OK. Oh, God. Oh my God. - Word of warning, mate, these ste-ink! Oh... I think it's hormones. Hurry up. - I just- I'll just sort my feet out. You go in. I'll be in-in a sec. - Righto. How do I look? - Yeah. Good. - Good. Hello, hello, hello! I can imagine. - Oh, mate. You don't know what it's like. - No, I can imagine. - It came at me, you know? I just held it like this. Like, literally... - There he is. This is Ian. - Oh, Ian. Hello. - Made him my personal challenge. I said, "You're gonna catch him in 20 minutes." Ended up catching him in 10. I always catch whatever I put my eye on. Oh, uh, Ian, this is Monica. This is Austin. They're from Australia. - Hi. - Austin used to be a safari ranger back in Zimbabwe. - Hey. - That's how they met. - OK. - Have we met before? - I don't think so. - Yeah, we have. Haven't we? - Mm... I don't know, babes. - Oh. Where should I put my bag? - Oh, just go and claim one of the bunks, doll. - Just not too close to me. I don't wanna wake up cuddling. You know, I don't want spooning or anything. I hope you don't bloody snore, Ian. Oh, I think they're on their bloody honeymoon. So I'm going to have you in one bed snoring... and them in the other... rooting. See you out there. - OK. - Do you guys like cards? Soup time. Ooh, mama. - Do you think anyone else is gonna come tonight? - I wouldn't have thought so. Fuck walking in that, anyway. It's like liquorice soup. Plus, it's the end of the season, so not likely to be anyone around. - Sorry. - Don't apologize. Take your time. - OK. I think I'm done. - Come on, Ian. You barely finished cooking your meat. - It's- It's fine. - Finish cooking your meat, Ian. Come on. I wouldn't live with myself if you got sick. - It's all right. It's fine. - You brought meat? - Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was weird, too. - Hey, did you pack the hemp milk, babe? - Yeah. - Oh, but... I just can't find it. - I'll come take a look. - Come on, cook your meat, Ian. - No, honestly, you cook your thing. - No. Go ahead, please. - Yeah. OK, the milk is not here. - Well, maybe I didn't pack it, then. - Austin, I put it on the bench for you to pack specifically. What are we gonna put on our muesli in the morning, then? - Jesus, Ian! - For... - Geez. We need to do something. Get some water or something! - You don't put water on hot oil. - Yeah, you do. Water combats fire. - It'll make it worse. - Yeah, maybe in Australia. - Put a lid on it or something. - Oh, shit. Fuck's sake, Ian. - Cover the flame. Suffocate the flame. Gosh. My Lord. Is it out? - Yeah. - All right. - It just smells. - Open a door or something. Open the window. Open the window. - How do you open the window in the cabin? - Open it. - Well, how do you open the window in the...? - You all right? - Yeah. - Are you leaving us? - No. Um... - That's your pack. - Oh. Uh, I was just airing it out. It's... - What are you looking for? - I think I just... saw a... an animal or... - You got bears around here? - No. We don't have anything. - Mm. I killed a lion back in Zimbabwe. It was attacking my dog, so I killed it with a rock. It's a protected species, you know. And I had to go to court and... stuff, but what was I supposed to do? It was mauling my dog. - Really? - There you are. We've just been cleaning up your mess, mate. It's not a very good hiking etiquette, is it? - Oh. Ian, doll. You look terrible. Did you sleep? - Yeah. - Huh. OK. - Better get a wriggle on if we wanna walk with these guys. - Oh, no, no. I-- - You'll be ready in 10, yeah? - No, no, I'm-- - Listen. Mr Austin Big Shot keeps going on and on about how great he is at hiking. I doubt he's even that good. I reckon even you could outpace him. - I don't wanna... go with them. - Before I forget... For your blisters. They're thick, so you won't have all that slipping and sliding. There you go, mate. - Thank you. - No worries, mate. Gotta take care of those tootsies, eh? Plus, you can just give 'em back at the end of the walk, yeah? Cos they're a bit expensive. Cheers. - When I was a kid, I used to go fishing with my dad, and he took me to South Africa when I was 15, and I saw a great white. - Oh. - You seen a great white before? - Oh, yeah, I've seen a few sharks, yeah. - ...and then I stopped, and then that was when he proposed. Like, right there in the Jeep with the herd of elephants watching. It was... Oh my God, Ian. Look at these! They're like wild African daisies or something. Ian, can you take a photo of me? - Uh, yeah. OK. - Yeah, perfect. OK. Now, I'll just do this. Ian, you should be in it. - Oh, no. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Quick, come here. Come on. - No. - Come on. Come on. Down here. - No, no-- Oh... Oh. Uh... - Come on. Come here. Oh my God. This is gonna be so good. OK. We'll put that in. Matchy-matchy. All right. Arms up. Nice angle. Beautiful. All right, now you just have to, like, keep on pushing that, cos we're gonna do heaps of photos... - OK. - ...and we'll just do selection. OK, ready? Go. Go. Go. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going, Keep going. - OK. We should go and catch up with the others. - Let's have a look, hey? Let's have a look. - Should we go and catch up with the others? - Ugh! Ian, they're rubbish. - Oh. - We haven't seen any of your native birds yet. - Nah, we saw that seagull. - That's not native, is it? - Oh. In any case, we thought we would've see, like, hundreds of birds in the forest by now. - It's so quiet here. - Yeah. - It's the weasels that get them... and rats.... and everything, really. Eats their chicks and their eggs, too. - Oh. Hey. We saw a dead animal in a tree on our way here. - Yeah. It was, like, all furry and that. - Yeah. - I have zero idea as to what it actually was, though. Ooh! Nicky, should you be doing that? - Beautiful. Aqua. Water. - Yeah, I know what "aqua" means. No, like, we've just read about the bugs in the water. - Not gonna get me. Don't you worry. Stomach of steel. - You caught any fish yet, brother? - No, I'm not trying to catch fish. If I was trying to catch fish, I'd come up here with an armful of fish. - Oh, hey, Ian and I got onto a really interesting topic of conversation before. - Oh, yeah? - We were talking about types. - Oh, yeah? - Well, I was actually talking about mine. Um, but, Ian, you never told me yours. Well, so go on. What's your type of woman? - Oh, I reckon I could probably guess Ian's. Someone a bit rough. Someone to really be firm with ya. Am I right? Kind of take charge of you a little bit. - No, like, are you married or maybe got a partner or something? - Uh, no. No, I don't. - No? But there was something, wasn't there? I can kind of pick up on these kind of things-- little signals. You were married or something? - Yeah, I was married, uh, before. I was, yeah. - Was married? Well, what happened? - Oh, Nicky... - What? He's all right. Come on. - Yeah, we separated. - Ian. Have you gone on any other tramps yet? - Uh, yeah, once or twice. - Mm-hm? - Um, I'm gonna... I've just gotta... Anyway, I'm gonna... just go toilet. - Good one. - What? - Oh my God. - OK. OK. - Oh my-- Ian, are you all right? - Yeah. Why? - Just you look pale as fuck, bro. Must have been a hell of a shit. - I just saw some blood. - Gross. Are you OK? - Yeah. No, it was-- it was something else that was bleeding. - Well, what was it? Did you see what it was? - No. - Hey, maybe a weasel eating a kiwi, right? - Should we get going? - Yeah. - Yep. - It was so stupid. I was kicking my rugby ball around inside. Of course I knew I wasn't meant to, all right? This is one of the periods where we were staying in a hotel cos, you know, Dad had gotten really angry-- Oh, Father. Sorry. Meant to call him Father. But we were staying in a hotel, right? Because, well, there was an argument. I dunno. I don't really remember a lot of it. I think I was, what, 13? And, um, yeah, I was kicking the rugby ball around inside, and I hit the, uh... the picture frame, and it fell down and smashed into the glass table. And then, man, we had to, you know, pay a bond to the stupid hotel. Oh, man. And then my mum... - Austin? - Yo. - Austin. Can you see that? - What? - Can you see--? Look, can you look down that path? - Uh... - Can you see that black shape that's...? - Sorry, my man. My eyes aren't that great. I don't... What do you see? - There's a black shape. Can you see that? It's... - Uh... I don't-- - I think it's been, like, following us for the entire-- - What are we looking at? - Ian thinks he can see some kind of dark shape. - Can you-- Can you see that? It's just-- Can you see that? - What is it, like a tramper? - I don't see anything, bro. - Yeah, I don't... I don't see anything either. - It's probably... It's probably just a trick of the light, I think. - OK. - Well-- - I think- Let's just... - Well, no, is--? - Let's just keep going, I reckon, guys. - Is it like an animal, or...? - Or... like, a pig, maybe? - Um, yeah, it's probably a pig. - Oh, it could've been a goat. Was it a goat? - Yeah. It... - Or a deer. There are deer out here as well. - Yeah, it's probably a goat or a deer, I think. - Ah. There we go. It's one of those things. Mystery solved. - Uh, I don't think you think it looks like any of those animals, Ian. - Oh, no, it-- that could have been a... it could have been a goat or nothing. - Yeah, I mean, they kill goats around here, so it's probably just a goat. There are goats around. - Yeah. Let's just go, guys. Let's... - There are goats around. - Oh, so good we're the only ones again. Honestly, sometimes I just can't be bothered being around other people. Do you know what I mean? - Uh, I was kind of hoping there'd be some ladies here. - Babe, look what I found. That's what I was telling you about. - Nice. - Someone else is here. There's some packs. - Oh. - Ooh. - Maybe they've gone down to the stream or something. - Ah. Yeah, well, they must be girls, cos it's purple and pink. What do you reckon, mate? - Babe. Mon! Check it out. - Whoo-ow! - Oh! No, no, giz it here! Giz it here! There we go. You ready? - Yeah. - Here we go. - Oh- Oh! - Hey! Whoo-hoo! Ian, mate. Come and have a boogie, mate. Hey. Monica... Monica, she is into me. She's been flirting up an absolute storm. Austin doesn't seem to give a shit. Do you reckon they're open? Like in an open relationship or something? Yeah, like, maybe it's like a wife-swap situation. - I wouldn't... I wouldn't know. - Or maybe like a... uh, cuckolding. A "cuckolling." You know. Oh... Oh, well. Come on. Come and have a dance. Oh-oh-oh! Nicky's back! - Hey! - You've got five more minutes. - Come here. - Five. - Sorry. Sorry. I should have said something. I didn't wanna scare you, but I guess the torch is pretty scary, too. What's going on? Ian. - Yeah. What? - What's up? - What do you mean? - What do you mean, what do I mean? You don't seem to sleep. You're all... edgy. You know, your whole vibe. Your whole vibe is just so... Do you want some sleeping pills? I've got some. They'll help. - Yeah. - Yeah? These are great, mate. Honestly, they'll knock you out. There you go. Just take one. Yeah, one's plenty. Oh, I've got a bit of a dicky tummy for some reason. Ah. That's better. You having trouble switching the old brain off as well, huh? Yeah, I know what that's like. What's on your mind? Actually, no, you don't have to tell me. Sorry. I shouldn't have asked. Prying. - I'm just so tired. And I can't sleep. Sorry. Sorry. You don't need to... ...hear my problems. - No, don't say sorry. - I just wanted some quiet. But it's so quiet out here... that all I can hear is my brain... turning over every fuckin' thing I've done wrong. All the fuck-ups I made because I'm so fuckin' weak. - What makes you think you're weak? - I just am. Sorry. - No, you're all right. - I might just grab a water and... and go to sleep. - Yeah, OK. Yeah, me too. Me too. - Thank you. - You're all right. - Honestly, they'll knock you out. Just take them. Yeah, one's plenty. - Oh, good morning, sleepyhead. How did you end up on the floor? - Nicky gave me a sleeping pill. - Well, it must have knocked you right out. - Where is Nicky? - Oh, him and Austin are outside trying to catch fish with their bare hands. It's so fucked up. - I have to show you something. - Yeah? - Who put the... packs back? - What do you mean? Ian? Ian, doll, you shouldn't be doing that. Ian! - There's a photo of Nicky on here. - So? - So he must have done something with them! To them. - Who? - These girls! - Oh! So good. - Well, there weren't even any bloody fish in there, so that was a complete waste of time. Hey! Finally awake, boyo. - Who put these packs back? - I did. And I put a sleeping bag over you, too. You would've bloody frozen out here. I could've lifted you into the bunk, but... I didn't really have the time. I didn't wanna wake you guys up. - Where are they? - Where are what? - The girls. - What girls? - These girls with the-the... who own the packs. You're in one of their photos! - Am I? - Yes. - OK. Give us a look. Show us. - The battery's dead. - Wait. I was in one of their photos? - Yes. You were looking at them. - Um, I don't know what he's talking about. - He killed them. - Whoa. OK. Hold up, hold up, hold up. OK. Obviously, this is some kind of misunderstanding. I mean, come on. - Well, why are their packs still here and they're not here? Where are they?! - They probably just left them here while they went on a day trip. - It'd be really good if we could see the photo, Ian. It could be a trick of the lens or something. - And he drugged me. - What? - You drugged me last night. - You said you needed a sleeping pill. You couldn't sleep. - Yeah, well, no sleeping pill's that strong. - Ian, you might have a sensitive constitution or something. - Yeah, obviously. - No-- Well, why...? You were still in-- Why--? When you were... - What are you trying to say?! - You were in front of me. But when you met me-- when I met you, you were coming up from behind. - Well, I had to go back. I went back to the car park. - Hang on. What for? - I had to get something from my car. - Hold up. So you went back to your car? - Yeah, that's why I ended up behind Ian. - Well, why didn't we cross paths, then? Why didn't I cross you? - Uh... - Wait, so you were in the photos? Do you know the girls? - No. No. You guys are the first people that I've seen on this whole walk. - Well, why didn't we cross paths when you went back to the car park? - I don't know, Ian! You were off the path for some reason. Hiding or something. Look, I didn't murder any fucking girls, OK! - Hungry? - Oh my God, I'm dying for a proper coffee. And I need a proper shit. Hello. - How far away was it? - Like, 10km up. - Yeah, there were no signs or anything. - And we thought we saw something, but... they were probably just bones from anywhere. - But where did you guys sleep, though, last night? - In one of the caves. - Shit. - Uh, we're hard-out. - So how did you know about the bones? - Well, it pays to date a paleontologist. - Uh, we weren't even dating. Anyway, he said there were moa bones around here. And then he showed me how to find the cave. Talia's got some photos on her phone. Honestly, it's all you need to see. - Cool. - Is... that my camera? - Oh, look, we were just, like, trying to figure out where you girls were last night. That's it. - I'm sorry. - This was charged before. - Do you know him? - Apparently, I'm in one of your photos. - How do you know what photos were on there? - Uh-- Oh. - Ian... Ian hasn't been sleeping very well. Have you, doll? - We were trying to work out where you were. We were worried. That's all. - You guys gonna check out the Kauri forest? - Oh, yeah, definitely. - It's pretty amazing. - Oh my God. - Fuck! Looks awesome. - So have you done anything in Aussie, or...? - Yeah, I lived there for like five years. I did the Crocodile Hungee trek. - Hey! - Yeah, have you done that? - Uh, no. I heard about it, though. - Yeah, we haven't done that. - It's a 21-day trek. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. - Um, do you pay for it? - Yeah. It's, like... - Milford, tick. Tongariro, tick. Easy. Couple of times a year, maybe. Gave myself 20 minutes to catch up with him, caught him in about five. I always catch everyone I have my eye on. - Nicky, could I have a word? - Uh... I'll just... - See you soon. - Um, Nicky, I just wanted to, um... I just wanted to apologies just about before. I just-- My mind just went... My mind just always goes to the worst possible scenario. And I'm sorry that you got caught up in that. I shouldn't have gone into their bags. What a... I'm so stupid. I'm so sorry, Nicky. - Bro, it's actually totally fine. - Really? - Yes. Ya noob. I know you haven't been getting much sleep lately, and... I know what that can do to a person. - Yeah. - You thought I was a killer. Argh! Plus, I'm in too good a mood to be angry today. I'm catching quite a vibe from this Talia girl. - We've already been, but, um, you-- you go. You'll have so much fun by yourself. - Yeah, nah, I reckon the whole squad should go. It'll be fun, the whole team all together again. Like a whole crew. - We've kind of already made plans. - Like joining forces. - All right. Ready? - Yeah. - Hey, guys. - Mm? - I just wanted to apologize about... just before-- - Oh, Ian, stop. It's funny. - I thought he murdered them, though. It's so... It's so stupid. - Yeah, but I would've come to the exact same conclusion. I'm paranoid as hell. Hey, babe? - Mm. Seriously, dude. She thought our neighbor had a secret family hidden in the attic. - Yeah. I still maintain he did, cos he's a psychopath and a creep. So, we're off. Come on. Ian. Up. - Yeah. It looks like you guys are heading off anyway. - Aw! - Are we? - What a shame. - But one of the guys tries to jump over a creek, and he slips! His ankle jams, like, right in between two rocks. But his weight pulls him over-- crack, crack, crack! All the bones go through the skin. Blood everywhere. All down the stream, little ribbons of red blood. His friend faints immediately, of course, scared of blood. So I have to jump in. I have to run to get help. So I run about 20, 30... actually, probably 50km. It's a good thing I was so fit at the time, actually. I was, uh, training for a marathon. All right. We going to the Kauri forest? - Yeah. Uh, actually, we thought that we'd check out the waterfall. - What?! No, no, no, no, no. Kauri forest. This is, like, the whole reason I came on the whole trip. - Yeah, well, you two can go, and we'll just meet you at the next hut. - We can go to the-- We'll go to the waterfall with you. We go to the waterfall? - No, I wanna go to the Kauri forest. Apparently, it's meant to be beautiful. - Yeah, well, you two can go to the forest, and we'll, um, meet you at the next hut. - OK. Yeah. We'll see you there, you guys. Let's go, Nicky. - Bye, Nicky. - Bye, guys. - 'K, you're making a huge mistake. - Bye, Ian! - Aw, maybe we should just go to the waterfall. - I think they wanna be alone. - What? Why would they wanna be alone? What, you think they're gonna have sex? Of course they fuckin' are. It just doesn't make any sense. I mean, cos the next guy she was with, they end up engaged. And, I mean-- And it happened like that. Which happened to the last girl I was with before her as well. I mean, it just doesn't make any sense. You talk about you having a breakdown, but, I mean, that was a breakdown. - Hold on. Where's the path gone? - Well, the sun is there, so... Come on. And Mum, she got pregnant with me when she was about 15, so she couldn't really leave him, you know? Well, she could have, but... I don't know. - This is definitely not the path, Nicky. - No, yeah, it is. It is. It is. It-- It goes from there, and it... - See, I don't even think that was the path that we came up. I don't... - No, no. That's definitely the path. - Look, I think we go back to the fork where the waterfall-- you know, go- and then we go via the waterfall, and we just go that way. - No, we've been walking hours since then. No, no, no. This is it. This is definitely the-- Hey. Feeling lost, mate? Just go straight. Yeah? - OK. Nicky. Nicky, this isn't the path. - Yeah, it's obviously not the path, Ian. OK? You were right, and Nicky was wrong. We're just gonna have to sleep in my pup tent. - No, we can't do that. I don't wanna stay outside tonight. - Yeah? What would you rather? Should we just walk through the night? - No. - No. OK. Yeah? So we'll just-- we'll make it to the bottom of the hill. OK? At least. - Hey, watch out! Oh my God! Oh my God. Are you all right? - Ah! What the fuck is that?! - It's all right. 'S all right. - It's a-- It's one... It's a trap. They've been trying to trap goats, apparently. - Goats? - Yeah. - What, in this big fuckin' thing?! - No, no- - Ah, shit! Ah, shit! - It's all right. It's all right. It's only me, OK? - Oh. Toilet break. - What? - Urgent toilet break. Sorry. Two seconds. - Watch out for traps, though. Watch out... - Ian, you're gonna have to speed up. The sun is starting to set. - I know that, Nicky. I just don't wanna stand on any hidden traps. - Oh, shit. - What? - Shit, shit, shit, shit. - What? - Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse the pun and excuse me. - OK. - Oh! - Oh, God. - Oh! Oh! Whoo! - Nicky? Nicky. - I'm coming. I'm coming. - You good? - Yeah, let's go. Barely touched the sides. Oh, God, now we're going fast. - Nicky. Do you ever feel like you're being watched? - What, by the government? - No. By something in the trees. - No. - You don't feel that? - Feel...? Feel...? No, I don't feel anything, Ian. There's nothing here. Honestly, there's nothing here. - OK. - Wait. Hold on. Wait. - What? - Can you hear that? - What? - The waterfall! Ian, the waterfall! Ha ha ha! He-he-hey! Yes! Ian! We made it! We made it, Ian! We made it! I told you, you didn't have to worry. I told you. - Oh. Oh. - Ah. - It's getting pretty dark, though. Should we... keep going? - Yeah, I guess. - Yeah. It's beautiful, though, so... - Yes! What's wrong? Ian, what's wrong? - I don't... I don't-- I don't wanna... I don't wanna go in there. - In here? But it's the path. - Yeah. No, Nicky... - Come on, let's keep moving. You were just in the trees with no path, and you were fine. - Look, I know I-I seem really on edge, but... I've just got this feeling that something really, really bad is about to happen. And it feels really strong right now. - Ian, you always have that feeling, even when there's nothing to worry about. Do you have a torch? - No. - Well, lucky for you, Mr Sensible got us covered. - Look, I know you think I'm stupid, but I think something was following us before, and I... and I feel like it's gonna be in the trees waiting for us. It's... - The thing from the other day? The pig goat? Let's do this. You take the torch. Come on. You got this. Let's do it. - OK. - OK? - Yeah-- Yeah. Let's go really fast. Can we? - Yeah. - OK. - Fuck, it is kind of creepy. I can see what you mean now. - Don't say that. - Sorry. - Ooh, fuck! - Ian! - Shit. - Ian. - Shit. Oh my God. Let's run. - What? - Let's run. - No, no, no! Come on. Come on. You've gotta get it. - What? But it's... But it's... all the way down there. - Yeah, it's down there because you dropped it down there. Go and get it. - Oh my... No, I can't. I can't. - Ian, that cost me $300, that torch. - A torch cost you $300? - Yeah. Gotta grab it. We kind of need it. - Oh, fuck. Can you come with me? - What? No. Come on. It can't have gone far. You'll be fine. Just go. Come on. - Fuck. Please, let's just go. Let's just-- - Ian. No. - Fuck! Oh, shit. Yeah, OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shit. OK. Yep. Yep. OK. Oh, shit. Ah! Ah! Oh my God! Oh, shit. Something was chasing me. - Was that you screaming? - Where's Nicky? - Well, who was chasing you? - Oh, yes! - Ah! - Ian, there you are. - What are you--? What--? - You were screaming, and we were trying to find you. - Did you find my torch? - Ah! - Ah! What's going on? - It's-- Did you see it?! - See what? - The thing that was chasing me. - No. - But it was just down there. You were just-- Where--? It was where you were. - I didn't see anything. - Did you hear it, though? - The only thing I heard was you screaming. Was it you? - What? - Was it...? Was it you chasing me?! - What? - He snatched the torch off me cos he thought something was actually following him. - Yeah, that's what he was saying right before we ran into you guys. "There's something after me. There's something after me." - So there's definitely nothing that could've been chasing him in the bush? - No. No, it's New Zealand. I mean, there's nothing around. Maybe a pig. Maybe. - You know, we've really-- we've gotta get him home. - I agree. I mean, he's not even sleeping. - You guys can't take him. You're on your honeymoon. So, what, I'm gonna have to fall on the grenade, am I? - Is that OK? I'm sorry. - Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. - Oh, man. - Fuck's sake. OK. Hey, buddy. Um... Hey, this, uh... this... the thing you saw... - Yeah, can you explain that again? - I'm not making it up. - We're not saying you're making it up. - Yeah, no one's saying that. - Yeah. Um, it was as big as a man? - And it was... hairy? Yeah? - I don't know. I... I only saw it in the shadows. - OK. But, I mean, you- you thought it was Austin for a second there, right? You thought he-- he might be chasing you? - I don't know. I... I was just-- I wasn't thinking straight. - You weren't thinking straight, Ian? - I was thinking straight. I just wasn't... I wasn't sure what was chasing me. - So it's kind of like when you said that Nicky killed those girls? - It's just we don't have any animals that size here. D'you know what I mean? - It could be, like... I don't know, um, when you're... on edge. - Yeah. - Yeah? Cos you haven't been sleeping very much. - And it's hard to sleep out here. - Yeah. It's... Things can seem, like, way bigger than they actually are. - Totally. And, you know, sometimes they're not even there, maybe. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Would that be fair... to say, Ian? Um, Ian, we've had a chat. And, like, um, by no means are we trying to, like, make decisions for you, Ian, but... And, um, we thought... Actually, Nicky thought... Didn't you? You thought... - Yeah. You know what, bro? You know what I reckon we do? I reckon me and you get up early, like crack of dawn, yeah? And we just-- we just rip it out, man. All day. We just walk for it. We get to the last hut around mid-afternoon... - Yeah. - ...but we keep going. - Keep going. - Yeah. We'll get all the way to the car park. - And when you're at the car park, you're gonna be in range. Yeah? - And so Nicky, or you, could call someone to come pick you up and, you know, look after ya. - Anyone. Anyone you need. You all right? - Yeah. - We're making good time, so... how about we stop and take a break for a bite to eat, drink of water or something in about five minutes? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yes. - Yeah. OK. Break in five minutes. We're almost there. - Oh, for shit's sakes. I'm so sorry that you have to look after me, Nicky. It's so humiliating. - Look after ya? - Yeah. - No, no, no. I just need to get back. So this all-- this all works out well. - Am I crazy? - What? No. No. - You all think I'm seeing things that don't exist. That sounds pretty crazy to me. - But you know that it doesn't exist. Right? - I guess my mind's just... Fuck. I'm such a fuckin' loser, man. Fuckin' hell. - Hey, come on. - Such a fuckin' loser. - Ian, don't start all this again. Oh... - Fuckin' hell. - Uh, hold on. Nope. Sorry, mate. Two seconds, yeah? - Fuck. Nicky? Nicky? Nicky? - M, Maldives. - Nice. - N, Namibia. - Yes. - O... Oof. Wait, there is one. Hey, wait. There is one, or there isn't one? - Yes, there is. - Ah. Well, it-- I was-- OK, what's up? - Is that Ian? Wait. Where's Nicky? - What do we do, babe? Austin, what do we do? - We stay calm. What's happened? - It killed him! I told you! I told you! - Wait. Nicky? - Is he still alive? - No, it killed him, and it ate him! - The... big creature? - Yes! You said it wasn't real. - OK. All right. We're gonna keep walking. - No, you can't! You can't go that way. That's where it is. We have to go this way. I know you think I'm crazy, but please. - Ian, if-if we go that way, it'll take us days to get back. OK? - Yeah. And maybe if he's hurt, we can-- we can save him. - It killed him! Look, I know you think I'm crazy, but we have got to go this way. Please. I-I promise you, we have to go this way. - Ian. Ian, doll, is it OK if Austin and I just have a quick conversation? - Oh no. God. - OK. Keep behind me. - OK. OK. Hey, Ian, doll, we're gonna keep walking in... this direction, OK? - And you're not coming with us. All right? If you follow us, it'll be a big mistake. Understand? - No. No, please. No. - Oof! OK. All right. Let's see. Do you think we're even gonna make it to the hut before dark? - Yeah, of course. - Are you sure? - Promise. We'll make it. You all right? Monica! Monica! Monica! Monica? What have you done with her?! - Shh. It can hear you. - What have you done with her?! God. No, no, no! Oh, God. Oh, God. No! - Look, I know you're freaking out right now, but we've gotta get out of here. - You fuckin' monster! - Oof! - Ah! You fucker! - I thought you were gonna kill me! - Fuck! - I didn't kill your wife, OK? Let me help you. Let me help you. Austin. Oh, fuck. - Ah... Ah! - Almost there. - No, we're not. What... What the fuck was that? - A bird thing, I think. I don't know. - God. God. I'm bleeding everywhere. You should just leave me. - You're all right. We're almost there. Promise. - It'll find us. - In the morning, I'm gonna run the rest of the way, and I'll... get a helicopter to come and pick you up. - Doesn't matter anyway. It's coming to get us tonight. It's hungry. Hey. I'm sorry. For not believing you. Hm? For thinking you were crazy. - I thought I was crazy as well, so... you're not alone. - Come and get me! Come on! Come on, you fucker! Come and get me. Ah! Ah! - Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh, fuck. Ah! Ah! Ah! Fuck. Fuck. Hey. Help.
