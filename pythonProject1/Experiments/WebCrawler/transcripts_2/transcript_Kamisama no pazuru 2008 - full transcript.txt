It is shaped like infinity; thus the name. An accelerator which produces elementary particles... accelerating protons and electrons to the speed of light. As they collide, they're disassembled into elementary particles. Like the micro world similar to the advent of our universe... right after the big bang. Observing these particles scientists investigate... the genesis of our cosmos and how matter came about. Particle accelerators are ordinarily shaped in a line or a ring. However, Mugen was designed using a new system called cross-tron... with two rings aligned side by side. The person who devised this method was a Japanese woman named Saraka Homizu. Surprisingly, she's 17. Saraka is Japanese but was born in San Francisco. She doesn't know her father because she was an lVF child. Her mother selected a donor from a US sperm bank. Saraka displayed amazing talents in physics and math. At 12, she entered Carnegie Mellon University. After graduation, she entered the PhD program in computer science. Her cross-tron graduate thesis was adopted in Japan... and she's returned for this reason. 'Mugen' will start testing its beam firing system momentarily. We interviewed Saraka Homizu... who is involved in the official operation this fall. What are your roots? Outer space. Not Japan or America? So now you'll dispel any doubt about the secret of your birthplace? This has been Jennifer Collins reporting from Tokyo. SUMO HlGHLlGHTS KlYOFUJl SUSHl Welcome. Working hard Motokazu? Working my ass off. I doubt it. Why watch those nude fatsos while eating sushi? You..... You always change the channel during the match! A fish needs water; All rockers do. Got a job for you. Something big is clogging the toilet. Yours? What? Thought he graduated cooking school cutting fish the way he does. Makes pretty damn good sushi for an amateur. Him? I should've hired his brother. He's got a brother? He came to lunch once. A very well mannered guy. There you are. She's fuckin' beautiful. She was going with a friend said she'd... have to cancel unless I came. A sure thing on a southern island! Island? Where? Pipi Pipi? Thailand. Just show up for roll call at uni. The labs are small with no roll call. You don't have to go. Feel free to use my place. I got my own life dude. Why change the sheets if you're going? You may not mind but any girl you bring here will. Clean sheets are best. Bought you new ones. College girls love clean sheets. Figured you'd know how to please the ladies! Mommy, these flowers are pretty like you. Yoshikazu? You think so? Yoshikazu. Listen up. I don't care 'bout... Putting up a photo like helps too. My... Shiratori? Got no boyfriend now. Goddamnit. He's forever the ladies man! #Chasing pussy, my dumb brother... #flew off to a southern island at sonic speed. #I was chasing pussy too... #which had me challenging the enigma of creating a universe. So, now... beneath your asses silently sitting in those chairs. Both fat and skinny ones. Beneath your asses our 13,000 km Earth lies in an expanding universe. And it extends upwards too. So what exactly is it? Put simply: matter. This is matter; I'm also matter. You're matter and so's the air. The universe seems to be full of matter. So what percentage of the universe is matter? Only 4 %. So what's the other 96 %? Around 23 % is dark matter. And about 73 % is dark energy. Yet their makeup is unknown. We live our daily lives in a mysterious universe. In classical physics... matter defined as particles. Light was considered to flow in waves. But in the world of quantum physics... both matter and light are particles. Both act in waves. Even one renders a wave. In quantum physics, one can equal a wave. One particle is a wave. But simultaneously, a particle possesses both features. This is the basics of quantum mechanics. Quantum position and movement can't be calculated simultaneously. The result is always greater than Planck constant H. Planck constant H is incredibly small. What the heck are 'elements' and 'waves'? They're, you know... Was he talking about sperm? Whatever. Student? Auditing student. Getting old and wanna go out in style. Thought you could never graduate. Come on. Why choose... There are easier, more interesting majors, right? Last year... my wife passed away. Retired with my wife gone... suddenly with time on my hands... I thought, where am I? What am I? Dying without knowing that, it's too sad. Excuse me, you're? Watanuki. Hashizume. Then Watanuki... you think our universe was created accidentally from nihil? If that's what people say. If accidentally created from emptiness... couldn't humans make their own? The universe? Impossible, right? Why not? Impossible if you believe in God's act of creation. But if you don't, the answer lies in this 'nihil'. Like using a particle accelerator... to create anti-matter which doesn't exist in nature. Let's talk theoretics. Theoretically, is it possible? Watanuki. Got a moment? It wouldn't take long, follow me. See you then. OK. Heard you're good at asking girls out. Let's just say, I've got a way with words. Sit down. ! I want a certain student for our lab. Shiratori... said you were the man for the job. Shiratori... wants me to help her? DELUSlON And your reward for helping is my body. Bring Homizu to our class. Who? Saraka Homizu. She was supposed to join our lab. The administration is letting her graduate without attending class. Despite low attendance, she's reached the level of our class. I want her to graduate under the same conditions as others. You there? Aunty Physics asked for my help. What should I do? #Do what you want. I ain't coming back soon. What... happened? #Life sucks. Her 'friend' was... #a dude.# A dude? #Her ex-boyfriend appeared right before take off. #I thought we were delayed. It was his fault. #He came in, apologized all over. #She was so moved she hugged him. #What else could I do but say 'that's great'. You still went to Thailand? #What could I do? Gonna be a nomad. Nomad? #Don't feel like coming home. #Off to Delhi. Always wanted to see India. What about your classes? India? #Whatever. #If anyone calls, bullshit them. My flight's boarding. #Who is it? I've been sent by Professor Hatomura. I'm in Saraka's seminar. Today's an auspicious day for Ms. Homizu. #Come in. Really? Saraka? Someone from college is here. Go ahead. Is it alright? Huh? Can I come in? I'm... coming in. I'm in. Hey. Your guest is here. Face me. Your guest has come to see you. Face me. I said 'face me'! Or I'll mess you up. You really a physics student? Yeah. I'm full of... physics. I'm... Check out my atoms. List the 4 basic forces of physics. The 4 forces... Oh, those, um... I know them. 'Course... I know them. But... if you were gonna gimme a hint, what kind would you give? One is gravity. Name the other 3. Name the forces. The three... forces of marriage, right? Three important points of departure for the bride and groom. There are three forces of marriage. Patience is the first one. You in Hatomura's lab too? 'Course. If I'm not in that lab, who is? I'd like to see that. You... look hot in sweats. Keep it to yourself. So? I heard from Shiratori. Heard you chased her away. Didn't ask her to come or leave. Have the research projects been decided? Research projects? You must choose a research theme, right? Oh, is that right? What's your theme? If you must know, it's about creating the universe. If you're talking 'relativity' or Higgs boson, you're wasting your time. Intriguing. Hey, Yoshikazu. Yoshikazu. Motokazu, right? Yeah. Can you keep it a secret? Roll call? And you're going to lab too? Don't worry. How'd you know it was me? That... t-shirt gave it away. It says 'physics' to me. E=mc squared? It's like going to the US with an I LOVE NYC t-shirt. I'm... a nerd. Wanna trade? Wanna swap? Come on! No way. Morning. Shiratori. What's with that? Excited about the lab? She likes it. Thought she would. You do like it. Good morning. Morning. Who's that? Airi, a grad student. He helps in the seminar. Have you decided your themes? Mr. Sudo? Something to do with quantum mechanics. Sakura? Superstring or dimension theory. Tricky. Shiratori? Maybe... it's too safe but I like relativity theory. Every year, many students choose relativity. Proving your own theory of relativity, are you Einstein? No. Lately, I'm interested in... the creation of the universe. What do you think? Open mouth; insert foot. What? It's a theme. Why choose that? Sounded good to me. I wanna go with that theme too. Without a big theme like that I was gonna take off. Creating the cosmos? Ruling it impossible? Yes. Why? How will you harness enough energy? So conversely with enough energy, it's possible? Impossible. Why? Take this for example. Epsilon, what does it stand for? The fraction of M into E when hydrogen turned to helium during big bang fusion. As an integer 0.007. Let's say that was 0.006... Protons and neutrons wouldn't bind. And if it was 0.008? Atomic fusion would've continued leaving no hydrogen. If the value varies slightly? Life wouldn't exist in the cosmos. And Omega? Relative density of the cosmos. If this was off one nanosecond post big bang? Our cosmos wouldn't have expanded. Making all life nil. N? Electric energy as a value of gravity. And if this were weaker, no stars. If it were stronger, too much heat. Rendering star life too short. No time for life to evolve. Lambda? The cosmological constant. Q? The amplitude of cosmic microwaves. D? The value of spatial dimensions. These 6 delicately balanced values... miraculously made our 'cosmos of life'. If any were even slightly off... then our cosmos wouldn't exist. Energy isn't the only issue. How could this delicate structure have been created? Without God it would be impossible? I won't say that, but... But what about the idea of miraculous accidental creation? Or your own convenience? The multibirth hypothesis! But even accidental creation could... If using multibirth then... 'all you need to do is create the start of the universe'. I see. Multi-what? The theory of infinite universes. Like cheap sci-fi? It's a serious theory. How interesting. Can humans create a universe? How about debating it? Divide into those for and against it? We must take this theme seriously. We'll have a weekly presentation followed by a debate... picking the next topic from the debate. The winning side passes. The losing side fails. Homizu and Watanuki on the affirmative. If one more joins their side, it's 3 versus 3. Anyway, it'll be 4 versus 2. Let's start with an overview of cosmos theory. Watanuki can start. To create a universe, we must understand its structure. God's Puzzle. Your words, right, Einstein? Yeah! I'll skip class. Forget Yoshikazu's credits. I'm a musician. A troubadour working at a sushi bar. Oh no! Come on, Miho. This is bad. Shit. Wait for your paycheck 'til we rebuild. For real? Lend us dinner money? You serious? FLASHBACK This part-time job is located... in a field beneath Mugen. They're taking applicants from our university. They still have openings. Great news. The second force of marriage... is your salary. Hi. #Yoshikazu, it'z your mother. #Doez Motokazu have a cell? #Got hiz number? He don't anzwer at the apartment. Touring with hiz band? #That ztupid band, never happen. #Hiz terrible songz no one wantz to hear. Music izn't 'bout good or bad... if he doez it with spirit. #What? #Zaying school is horrible and he hatez ztudying. #He alwayz ran from responziblity. No good at all. #How can twinz be so different? Are we so... different? #Very different. #You were never an embarrazzment. #But Motokazu is alwayz embarrazzing. Fuck off. I'll master this in no time. The mystery of the universe? I tell you I... am totally clueless. Master. Master? What don't you get? What? Inflation. Anti-matter. Superstring theory. Strings? Don't! Gimme. Not that. You got plenty. I gotta buy medicine for my mother. Work harder! Honey. But Shiratori could never leave her pimp's side. Women lead sad lives. TO BE CONTlNUED HlMO (string in Japanese) A bit long, eh? M M Theory. PlMP M Motokazu, 21 Calm down! Understand the birth of the cosmos? It's shaped like this illustration. Here's the start of everything. Then 'inflation' and then the big bang. Gravity, strong and weak interaction, and electromagnetic force split. Follow me? What don't you get? First... how does this appear 'poof' from nothing? No one knows that. Which is why we research it. Which is why we enjoy it. Enjoy it? The universe is a mystery novel. Finding criminals, clues and motives is fun, right? OK. So how about 'inflation'? What about it? Wasn't matter created after the big bang? So didn't the universe come after that? Never imagined anything between nothing and the big bang. And how do you know it existed? What's the opening of Beethoven's 5th? 'Fate Motif'. Wrong. It's this. I'm right. Wrong. Where? First, there's an 8th note rest. Look. Got it? 'Thus Fate knocks at the door!' according to Beethoven. What does this rest indicate? Like taking a breathe? Then, an instant that says, 'No way!' The instant when the mind is silent must be 'fate'. But the silence before the music... that 8th note, did you hear it? Nope. So when did the music begin? The 8th note rest before the first note? But what conductor can hit that rest without being a nanosecond off? Even if he could... So we study the universe using math? Observations and calculations based on them. New phenomena overturn accepted theories. Personally I think Beethoven's 9th is cooler. I agree but you've missed my point. But... it's fate. Before 'fate' was written, Beethoven was there. Meaning? Before the universe someone was there? Dunno. Like you said, too skillfully constructed to be accidental. Thus the multibirth hypothesis. Sounds like bullshit. Try understanding it like this. Each bubble is a universe. If mankind can create a universe, think about this. As this root appears from its parent, a new universe is born. Our universe is where this new root is. Split off from the older ancestor root. Of course, this hasn't been observed. It's unknown if it's multibirth. But it's an accepted hypothesis. With infinite universes with different laws and values... the balance of our universe could be 'chance'. Not a godly miracle but miraculous infinite accidents. So we just need to create the advent of our universe. With some random firing we might create one that breeds life. The problem is whether it can be created on the outside or not. But it might not be? No one on Earth has tried. What if it was created on... the inside? Our current universe might collapse. Creating one is impossible, right? If we used Mugen and... But... you won't, right? Even if you could. Maybe not. Mugen has been built... with two rings, the eastside and westside. Each with a 2 km diameter. Here's the talked about cross point. The accelerated particles collide here. Is its control room here? Yes. One control room in each wing. The westside control room is here. The cross point has a counter hole and observation room. And a data gathering electric hut. That looks good. That passageway. Only smoke and you would wanna climb it. Get it? You and smoke. For a #Kansai# boy, you sure ain't funny. I heard Mugen can create black holes. Is that true? We have high hopes but don't know yet. Won't a black hole suck up this place? Mini-black holes soon evaporate. Don't worry. Stop it. You're embarrassing! How can a black hole evaporate? Hawking radiation. Go home and look it up. Trust me; it evaporates. #On our field trip, I stopped by my new job. #An old lady living in a rice field. #She's raising seedlings and told me to come for planting. #Said Hashizume is coming too. #Probably the only job advertised at uni that took old folks. You gonna work here too? Get real. Cool, eh? Still using sheet iron roofs. Forever living her life stuck to this slope. Born and stuck here, she eats... and will die soon. What can she say about her life? Let her be. You're Japanese, right? That's what being down to earth means. If she doesn't get swallowed by the universes below... it's virtual reality. An illusion. If you've got time, follow me. Making a virtual program but can't figure something out. If you can't then I sure can't. Not entirely true. I gathered jpegs to make a porn site but... I dunno which ones make men hot. Could you pick some? Running a side business? Borrowing memory. My program eats it up. Gonna hijack PCs world-wide to create a universe. Does that happen when accessing? porn sites? It's possible with even one access. I can't do it without you. Please help. Are you... you... flirting with me? Who'd do such a beastly thing? Beastly? Animalistic. Something non-intellectual entering my body... makes me sick thinking about it. 'Cause you've never been in love. Not my fault. No men worth falling in love with. Not genius enough for you? I never said I was a genius! Go home and choose them ASAP. You... Is that any way to ask a favor? Shiratori's the girl for me! ElNSTElN FOR DUMMlES You came to Japan and ate shrimp and #kohada# sushi. Did the sushi get your brain working? Didn't do a thing, did it? I know as much as this bearded geezer. Wait for me baby. Next time we meet, my intellect will intoxicate you. People say our universe... was born from 'nihil'. How we define 'nothingness' is... what makes it difficult. Physics defines it as... a 'supersymmetrical' state. Right? Why's he asking me? But 'symmetry' involves line and point symmetry. The same shape, right? Turn over one... we get 'line' symmetry. Flip it up like this. At a glance, it seems different but... the point symmetry is intact. Basically, the same shape. Some conditions change but the basics don't. The symmetry remains intact. Right? I said don't ask me. So our universe... exists because of four forces: gravity, strong and weak interaction... and electromagnetic force. But before our universe, these were bound together. Their 'symmetrical' force was perfectly intact. This is called 'supersymmetry'. Then suddenly it broke. Dunno how but... 'Crack' it split right open. This is called 'CP-violation'. Wait a minute. In this case, don't you think that's a generalization? Don't you think that's a generalization? Shut up! It feels damn specific to me. And from this, our universe was born. From the rip in symmetry like a tiny bubble going 'pop'. Its size or Planck length 10 to the negative 35 m. The advent of our universe. Reaching 'inflation', the Planck length swelled to 1 meter in diameter. The CP-violation split further. Gravity separated. Gravity separated. After gravity separated... After gravity separated... the energy in the inflated universe changed to heat. You know, 'hot' to touch. Particles got electrical. The so-called 'Big Bang'. Then inflation subsided. And the temperature declined gradually. But then the symmetry ripped again. 'Strong Interaction' separated. Inflation temporarily ended and... turned to expansion mode. Then the final division of forces. The CP-violation once again. Electromagnetic force and weak interaction began. matter and anti-matter were created. This anti-matter relates to matter like heads and tails on a coin. When they meet, a nuclear explosion occurs, changing them into gamma rays. Einstein's E=mc squared means... energy and matter are the same. When matter and anti-matter meet, they morph into energy. If this matter and anti-matter were perfectly the same... everything would be gamma rays and our universe wouldn't have existed. But thankfully... matter was a tiny bit bigger than anti-matter. And so matter remained. The difference was only one billionth. If matter was one billion particles... anti-matter had 999,999,999. Thanks to this tiny gap, a matter universe was born. FYl, the time it took from... the start of inflation was... a millisecond. Will this commentary of 137 million years end in our lifetime? I'll wrap it up. Okay? When the temperature lowers enough... protons and neutrons can't remain apar Nucleuses are formed. Right? Around the nucleus electrons fell and formed atoms. About 380,000 years post Big Bang... via astronomy we can measure our universe. The scattered elementary particles formed atoms. 'Cause many gaps were formed... photons took flight. This muddy white plasma universe... turned to our black one. So-called 'transparent to radiation'. Then stars were born. Any questions? Shiratori? So what you're saying is... without CP-violation, our universe wouldn't have been created. So why did this CP-violation occur? That's it! Way to go! I dunno. So why? If I answered, this wouldn't be your presentation, right? If there was 'nihil' at first, super relativity is far fetched. Not super relativity but 'nihil' relativity. Calling it 'super' don't make it so. So how should we view 'nihil'? Symmetry's anti-opposite. Our universe is matter and anti-matter, plus and minus. Basically opposites that attract. Like men and women. So what's the opposite of symmetry? Anti-symmetry? Right! Right? Anti-symmetry surrounds us now. When did it first appear? What do you mean? Symmetry and anti-symmetry. If they're a pair, they appeared together. And before they appeared? I see. With 'perfect symmetry' intact simultaneously, an anti-symmetry state? Never happen. They're inconsistent. Neither would exist. If neither exists then they can't form anything. And so this is 'nihil' I guess. So... from nothingness, a cosmic action and a chaotic action occured simultaneously. Anti-symmetry as the fundamental truth? Cosmos and chaos... harmony and disorder. In this case, harmony and anti-harmony. Forget physical feasibility. The symmetry force and CP-violation fought each other... or cooperated to form our universe, right? Right on! Toying with fundamental laws is no game. This isn't a humanities class. You're the only one bothered by this. Can I ask Airi a question? Go ahead. A rift in matter and anti-matter occurred. Why was that? There was no rift. They were the same number at the start. 'Course they were. Matter and anti-matter are opposite pairs. They were the same volume at first. But their collapse rates: independent and different. You said, pair annihilation ended at '999,999,999'... with one independent antiparticle. So one billionth of matter remained. So matter and anti-matter are opposite pairs. And their asymmetry exists. If opposite pairs exist, perfect symmetry is ideal but... why did the difference occur? I don't... If we inquire further... why do the plus and minus pairs... remain opposite in the first place? Doesn't matter. That's the fundamental law. Doesn't matter? The defeat declaration of a scientist? You sneering at humanities department? If it's the law, then define the 'law'? What 'law' occurred from 'nihil'? Who's 'toying with fundamental laws' now? And 'it's no game'? Are we to only discuss your kind of science? Before talking about the universe do yuo know what you're talking about? Hold on. You're talking too fast! Sorry. I'm not as smart as you. This debate is pointless. Why? They made their point. Where was that? There's no ultimate learning. You pretending to be our parents? You're a tough student. Do those two hate each other? Saraka's got a bad rap too. Shiratori's the kind of girl who agrees with her boyfriend. Before Airi dated Shiratori... he courted Saraka. Made them rivals I guess. Shiratori's dating him? Yeah. India India Since when? End of last year. Yoshikazu! What? How's Yoshikazu? Dunno! You Japanese? I guess so. Be in India long? What do you think? Think it will work out? I panicked when my passport got stolen. But humans can live without such stuff. But that's bad. Tried the embassy? Yeah, I went. Said, 'Show me your passport as lD.' Said it was stolen. And then? Security rushed in, caused an uproar. I ran for my life. Then a child nearby went... BANG! Got hit by a car. Went flying... in the air. C'est la vie I thought. My passport? Who needs it? The universe is everywhere. Everyone as particles. India rocks. By dipping yourself in the Ganges... nothing seems to matter. Take care. India... the first to discover the concept of zero. A civilization fathoming emptiness absolutely. Fancy a break? I've got sweets. Oh thanks. Here you are. Wow, thanks. I can't make anything fancy. You made this? Yes. Hope you like it. Amazing. Thanks. You're welcome. Thanks. Is farming fun? Not much. Only do it 'cause I have to. We live in outer space. The static on your cell phone since the transparent to radiation era... are mixed with electromagnetic waves from hundreds of millions of years ago. Making a date with a friend or confessing your love. Or while talking bullshit on your phone... these distant electromagnetic waves secretly crossing. Disgusting yet moving facts... of our every day lives. While taking our class, Shiratori... started looking for a job. To become a working adult amid our suspicious universe... what will I do? What can I do... in our stunning, wide open universe? News that Mugen's operations were behind schedule hit the scandal tabloids. MUGEN POSTPONED, schedule hit the scandal tabloids. MUGEN POSTPONED, LlABlLlTY DEBATE ERUPTS Saying that Saraka's theory was wrong. It was a waste of tax money. She got bashed by the media. She was an easy target and they made her the victim. Saraka looks stressed out. Hiding out in her room, she didn't come to school. HlDDEN CAMERA PRETEEN SCHOOL SUBMlSSlONS WANTED Somebody uploaded this Why'd you call us here? I know this locker room and I know this girl. Saraka? Is this the girl's locker room? You filmed this? No. No chance you idiot! No, I just found it on the web. By accident. Don't look at me like that. Complete coincidence. Besides, I called you, right? Gotcha. I know. This is bad, eh? You can see it all! What's up? Maybe this is... from last month's intercampus event? Another school did this? Are you nuts? Prove it. What the fuck! It's me. If you're free, can you come over? Gotta ask you something again. Coming in. You look horrible. Ain't no skin off my nose. Really? You... you said the chaos and cosmos pair appeared from 'nihil', right? You don't quit. I made it up. I don't get intellectual stuff. Doing a simulation? Got the right perimeters and memory. Thanks to the 'exposure', access is up. You saw it too? Can't just stop at the 'exposure', eh? I put it to use on my site. The net perverts loved it. You... Who cares now. Unlocking the universe is more important. You've got the naivete I don't. Naturally, that's not enough. Chasing the phenomenon since the cosmos was created is a dead-end. If you can imagine 'nothing' properly 'something' can't objectively be seen. Like life and death. Something born from nothing. Giving birth to the format of pairs. So what force split the pairs? Coincidence? God? What specific force? If they split, something split them. What force? How'd it work? I tried programming a reflective magnetic repulsion force but no luck. Of course. Repulsion pairs with gravity. But even so... it's part of something. What split the pair? The start should be extremely simple. Well... you'll... figure it out. You're a genius. Wanna take a walk? I never said I was a genius. The media called me so. And now they say I'm not one. What the fuck! Everyone was wrong about me. How can I make you all happy? Get naked on TV and apologize to everyone for letting them down. Apologize and commit harakiri. Will everyone forgive me? For what reason was I born? Normally, parents say "we were in love". But not me. She wanted a genius... and bought sperm. I was bought. And. And put on a pedastle without asking... and knocked down. For what reason was I born? Make up your damn mind. Stop playing the good little girl all the time. Hiding away like this is making you moody! If you're human then... get to the rice fields. Stop. Lemme go. Dirt and grass will calm you down. Let me go! Look... hiding alone in the dark makes you lonely. Wrong. What makes me lonely... is being around others! Say whatever comes to mind. Don't talk like you know me. Now go. Leave! Leave! Leave! Einstein and everyone... dies never knowing the secret of the universe. Einstein said this. "I'm the true lonesome traveler." And he also said... "I understand nature a bit but... as for mankind, I hardly get it at all." For what reason... was I born? 'Teach...' 'me!' The massive Typhoon No. 7 near Okinawa... Guess it's headed our way, eh? Will the rice plants be alright? Who knows. All we can do is pray. Did you prefer hot tea? No, it's fine. Why do you have so many? My husband's mementos. He was always collecting this stuff. Boxes of it. A researcher, right? These wares are from the Jomon era. This spiral pattern was present in all ancient civilizations. A symbol of vitality according to some. I get it. When they ate swirling noodles they felt alive, eh? They probably viewed the world... in a totally different way. A different way? Spinning, spinning... Spinning, spinning... Everything's spinning round. Everyone's living. Typhoons, Earth... galaxies, particles. You busy? I got a question. You there? Answer me. What do you wanna ask? If you got a question, ask it! Why are we spinning? Why we spinning? Why we spinning 'round?! Spinning? A spiral. Is this it? A spiral and reverse spiral. Causing isolation and unification. Is the spin the source? I gotta setup the spiral and its vectors simultaneously! Saraka! Answer me! One more factor. What united the spiral and pair? That's the final piece of the puzzle. No, to create the universe, I don't need the final piece. If I have the physical elements... all I need to solve is the energy value! Open up. You... face me! Stop messing around. How do you define God? The creator of the universe. And if humans could create one, God doesn't exist, right? No better method to prove God's absence. You... wanna prove it? On the contrary. If God exists and he loves this world... he would stop my work! Guess I'm an idiot. A layman like me doesn't understand talented people. Okay. I won't stop you! If created on the inside, everything might explode. It can't be helped. And I got no right to stop you. I could kill you 'cause I don't wanna die. If there is someone out there... you don't want to see die... he can stop you. When's your universe gonna be done? Well... Well... I'll go live my life. Let me tell you. If you create it, fine. If you fail, you can't live to the fullest till doomsday. With the resolution to erase all life... pull the trigger. And if... you misfire... you'll... go crazy or... commit suicide. No other options. Either way, I'm alone. We ain't even friends? One message. Yoshikazu? It'z your mother. Call me for a change. I'm zending rice and veggiez. Good luck with school. Call you. I can't. Got no talent. Always embarrassing you. I'm good for nothing! As for the theory... that much I got. Now all that's left is... the trigger mechanism and the size problem. The massive typhoon No. 7 will... hit Tokai and Tokyo this evening. Call if Saraka does anything strange. WATANUKl What's this? The same as before? Yes. What about the other substations? Normal. No electric supply malfunctions. You nuts? Everything is malfunctioning! We must've been hacked with dummy system data! Chief! They detect no malfunctions at Shin-toyosu. Double check everything! All train line operation is suspended. Proxy buses are standing by. Shinagawa, Kashima, Hirono, Hitachinaka! All central thermal power stations report malfunctions! Energy output is rising! Chiba stations report no malfunctions! Boso, Shinkisarazu, Shinkeiyo, Shinnoda... their electrical supply data is normal. It's not. Where's the power going? Mugen has been hijacked? The OS is malfunctioning. Not control. How come? Mugen just started moving. The eastside ring is spinning backwards. And a collision angle is set. Spinning backwards? Call if Saraka does anything strange. WATANUKl Saraka. Fukushima nuclear reactors and Kashiwazaki-Kariya are out! Niigata's reactor too! What? Saraka Homizu is behind this? I don't know. Who else could hack the system? Cut the outside lines. Cut the outside lines. from the outside or inside. Now? Cut them. How's the Westside? Dunno. Nobody answers the phone. Security is on their way. Security is on their way. I'm there. Call my cell! Cut those lines? Cut already. What? They were already cut. They can't be fixed. Yes, please. Electric, hydraulic and nuclear power stations... are down in the Chubu region. All of central Japan? Then we're not being hacked. The entire grid is! Hold on! If the hacker can penetrate the grid then... the JNSC is being hacked. Hacking the Department of Defense mainframe? Get real! Glass. Break the glass. What the hell! What's wrong? DON'T TOUCH: THE BALANCE lS DELlCATE! Saraka. The finger print lD system has been cut. No doubt it's her. She's in Mugen. The lines were cut. No wonder I couldn't call. I tried the internal line but no answer. TOUCH lT AND THlS HAPPENS I tried the internal line but no answer. TOUCH lT AND THlS HAPPENS What the --- The program is laid with traps. Let's call the police. We've been criticized enough. Leave the police out of it. This is no time. Who could be guilty of this craziness? She might create a universe! What are you on about? The HF wave unit input is... over 150 %! Why so high? What about the interlock override? The FPGA has been reconfiged! Can't you cut it? If this keeps up, Mugen can't contain it! I'll call the police. Send security to the Westside. OK! Come on! I can take the rain, Split up! You go south! why can't you? OK! Anybody here? Sekiya! Airi, bring your cell! Central control room! It's me. Call the police from --- Hello, hello, hello. What's wrong? Got a waterproof cell phone cover? Got a water-resistant one. Bring it here! Don't think I brought... Go check! What happened? Got a phone? Give it here now. Saraka... Saraka? Saraka did what? She hijacked Mugen. Hello. Airi? Why? This... Upload it... Or I'll upload your photo. What's wrong? Where is she? The Westside control room I guess. Airi, Airi! Where are you going? Shut up! Don't come near! Airi! No doubt. An Iridium phone is... hacking via low orbit satellites. The lD? A rental shop in Minato-ku. But the line owner is on holiday at Christmas Island. Has the lD been copied? Hacker probably bought parts in Electric city and built one. We hacked that lD. And the hacker's whereabouts? Means disclosing the US military satellite data for the Far East. They'd never do that! We don't know if the hacker's in Japan or Eastern Mongolia? And the PM? On a military helicopter from Yokohama. Yokohama? His mother's birthday. Oh no! That's hot! I can't move ahead! No way. Falling back. You rammed the Westside? In the control room. I can't move my legs. No sign of Saraka. What!? Watanuki! What did Saraka do? Where is she? I don't know where! But she's operating Mugen! That passageway. With the emergency exit. With the emergency exit. And uh... Is there a control room? Depends. Maybe the observation room or the electric hut. The cross point? The electric hut has direct access. With an outside line you could --- You gonna climb the catwalk? If she fails, she'll commit suicide. Get in from the Westside. Airi drove his car through. You see that? Now? Disappeared for a second. Is that a... black hole? You okay? Fine. Hurry and get to Saraka. Electric hut. Which way? Electric hut? Saraka controls the inside. Only one way in. The advent of... a universe. No better method to prove God's absence. Daughter of Elysium Touched with fire, to the portal Of thy radiant shrine, we come Your sweet magic frees all others Held in Custom's rigid rings All men on earth become brothers In the haven of your wings Whoever has won a lovely woman Let him add his jubilation Yes, whoever calls even one soul His own on the earth's globe And who never has, let him steal Weeping, away from this group The luminosity... suddenly dropped. Stop! No closer! Hey girly. Sushi. Brought your sushi! You got time for some sushi, right! Put my soul into it. Eat it up! I put my soul into it. Eat it! You're lucky. I made 500 since lunch. Didn't have anything else to do. Have some #kohada#! Tasty? Tasty? Really? Is it good? Then I... got talent. Naturally... Saraka was arrested. Don't know what charge they trumped up but... it's not impossible considering what she did. She ain't no kid. And as for Airi... LAST WlLL: And as for Airi... Why 'ego' came from 'nihil'? And as for Airi... Why 'ego' came from 'nihil'? It abnormally drove me to this. When he died... did he see the universe expanding below his legs? Or did he forget that too? What went on that night caused a stir in the world. The management and professors almost got fired but... were saved by the skin of their teeth. Naturally, Auntie Physics resigned. The others were saved 'cause... Saraka's mother jumped in saying, "If you ask me, It's all my fault." With a mother like that, surely Saraka can get through life okay. The three forces of marriage: patience, salary and... one's mother are important I thought at last. But the attitude of the media really pissed me off. "Fuck off. Why do you care about such shit!" I barged right in. And so... I had to move to another "residence". And then my brother Yoshikazu got deported from India. It seems the embassy had been searching for him. The sushi shop owner came to visit me. He's planning to reopen and hired me back. But I think it'll be a while before they let me out. I decided to write the graduation thesis. GRADUATlON THESlS! MY OWN WAY Why'd you... 'Cause you're my teacher. Later. DEAR ElNSTElN THE THEORY OF SUSHl RELATlVlTY READ WHlLE LlSTENlNG! Graduation thesis, baby! Dear, Dear, Dear... Mr. Einstein... When asked about death... heard you replied "I won't hear Mozart again." Einstein and Mozart. Beethoven would work too. Science and art plus rock... give you what two shining inventions? If science is lost from this world... mankind would be unconscious. Yoshikazu! If art is lost... mankind would be dull and uninteresting. Open your eyes. The right to science; the left to art. Imagine how "solid" our world would be. But Mr. Einstein... heard you came to Japan and ate shrimp and kohada sushi. Was that all? Where was that sushi bar? What loser made it for you? Heard you admired shrimp tempura. Hold on buddy. You best not be rating tempura with sushi. That kid! My sushi will be so great, you'll say, "This is delicious. You rock." Guess it's all 'relative'. Studying physics and then becoming a sushi chef. Delicious! Thanks to that incomprehensible science... I was led to the world of Edomae sushi. And finally, as for "seeing" mankind in all creation. The pair of science and art are the exact same cognizance. That cognizance itself might just bring the pairs together. Or keep them walking along together. It's about 'free will'. Understanding our world is mysterious to man. And free will being born from 'nihil' is damn mysterious as well. Someday I'll make you the best sushi on the planet. And in this small corner of outer space, the best sushi in the universe! Long time no see. I came to eat sushi. Welcome!
