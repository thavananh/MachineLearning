According to informed sources... ...El-Sayed Jaffa, perhaps the most feared and Wanted terrorist in the world... ... was abducted yesterday afternoon... ... while secretly attending the wedding of his daughter in nicociocyphrus. He was then handed over to U.S. authorities... ...where he was arrested, and taken to an American warship at sea in the Mediterranean. Wire service intel reports. No one's answering, no description of Nazi Hassan as one of the casualities. There is No indication he was even there. He was there. All Right. ...Come On, have to, make it. You called this one right. Half the Middle East is back in Cyprus, if only in principle. Well. We wanted him and now we got him. And all the baggage that goes with him.

You have to Remain in your seats with your seat belts securely fastened. Do exactly as you're told. . . . . .and there will be no need for any further violence. Where's the passenger manifest? I said. Where's the passenger manifest? I destroyed it. You destroyed it? To protect the passengers? Or someone else? That was a very brave thing to do. . . . . .and totally unnecessary. Here's all the data you want on white rose. Sorry to spoil your evening, BOSS. Yeah. That makes two of us. What do you Got. It's him, no doubt. One from London, is a recording. Other one from the plane is live. This doesn't make sense. What the hell is he up to? General Wood just called. Briefing with crisis team at 6:00 in the Situation Room. 10 Minutes. -Pentagon? -Welcome to the big leagues. David. -You Got anything that I can change into? -Play for Grey T-shirt. I got a jog bra and a pair of running shorts. Thanks to anyway. Keep at it, guys. Donot Forget, This is a think tank. They pay us to think. Oh! By the way. . . . . .who is heading up the anti-terrorist unit? Colonel Austin Travis. Special Forces Command. You know him? Jesus! They said it was "come-as-you-are. " -Excuse me. -David Grant. This was recorded from the aircraft... . . .shortly after the bombing. This is AI Tha'r. I have a message for the American President. The London bombing will have indicating the string of my resolve. I am in control of Flight 343. This Aircraft and its passengers shall remain in my custody... ...until Abu Jaffa Criminally health against his will.............. ...is released from captivity. Mine Instructions are to be Follwed precisely. No theater. No negotiation. Abu Jaffa will be released and taken to Gatwick Airport... ... where a private jet will be given clearance to land then allowed to leave with him. Of on the release of Abu Jaffa, Flight 343 will continue on to Washington... ... where half the passengers will be exchanged for fuel... ...and 50 million in gold bullion. Jaffa must be Airborne and in communication with me by 6 a.m... ...or the Citizens of London will suffer another punishment on Your behalf... ... that will make today's bombing pale in comparison. Mr. Grant. This man. . . . . .AI Tha'r, who is he? Voice Print analysis confirms it's Nagi Hassan. . . . . .Jaffa's deputy director. He's an extremist in every sense. Taking completely out of his word. He's not bluffing. But In My Opinion. Thank you. Any other comments? Well It seems our first posture must be one of containment. You Mean..... Acquiesce to Nagi's demands? I don't see the President as any other choice. London is demanding immediate action. I agree. I hate the idea of conceding anything to that bastard. But we have to get him on the ground, then we'll have some options. Colonel Travis and his team will be ready to respond once the plane is at Dulles. It means shutting it down, re-routing all traffic. A full military control of the entire area. Secretary White. . . . Excuse me, gentlemen. . . . . .I don't believe we can allow that plane to land at Dulles. . . . . .or even enter U.S. airspace. What are you talking about? Sir, I don't think this is about hostages. I think it's about one man planning a major strike against the U.S. I think You'd better explain yourself. Mr. Grant. Our research leads me to believe. . . . . .that due to all his internal political situation. it was Nagi Hassan himself. . . . . .who worked on Jaffa's abduction. Go on. Six months ago, A shipment of the nerve toxic DZ-5 was hijacked. . . . . .while in transit from Russia to Germany. Now We're certain that the Chechen Mafia was behind the hijack. But Unfortunately recent attempts to recover the nerve gas have failed. A few days ago, Rumors surfaced that the DZ-5. . . . . .was now in the hands of Asmed Rhasjami. This is the prick who sent us on a wild goose chase. . . .a Known supplier of arms and explosives to Jaffa's group. Mr. Grant. . . . . .are you saying the nerve gas is on board? Yes, sir, I am. And In my opinion, Hassan is planing to use the DZ-5 and the airplane together as a tactical weapon. A sort of poor man's atomic bomb. . . . . .to be detonated here, over Washington. How much of this DZ-5 might he have? I can't be exact there, sir. But I can tell you this much. If this were DZ-5. . . . . .A single drop would be more than enough to kill every man in this room. And By the Way, The name he's using, "AI Tha'r" . . . . . .in ancient Arabic means "revenge. " I Would like to Welcome you on aboard, Senator Mavros. The press seems to thinks you could be the next President. It's an honor to have you with us. That plane will be here in Less than 8 hours. It seems to me, The President has two options. Disregard Mr. Grant's theory. . . . . .and let the plane proceed to the U.S. Or destroy it before it gets here. . . . . .along with 406 passengers. Even if we're right. . . . . .how would we ever prove it? Colonel, if you have an opinion, let's hear it. Mr. Secretary, There is another possibility. It's a Hail Mary pass, but. . . . Colonel, why donot you tell him what you need. There's a gentleman named Dennis Cahill who's an engineer for ARPA. I think he could help us. If we could get him on the line ASAP. I think he can tell you what I have in mind. Remora was originally developed by ARPA for the space program... ...for super-sonic low-orbit linkups with the shuttle. Although it was never actually implemented by NASA. It has since been modified by the Air Force... ... to study the feasibility of transferring the bomber crews at altitude... ...as well as other... . . .contingencies. We've had six actual hookups, all successful. But. This is a civilian airliner. Mr. Cahill. . . ...Are you telling us Remora could work in this situation with a 747? Obviously, This application was never intended for a civilian airliner. However, smooth-surface mating tests... ... have been successful in a wind tunnel. A wind tunnel. Colonel, I know you wrote the book on assaulting hijacked aircraft. But this is 5 miles above the Earth. Well sir, Under the circumstances, I donot think we have any other options. It's your call. We are going to have airborne in an hour, Select Team, six men. And I am going to need Mr. Cahill. . . ... to supervise the linkup. Mr. Cahill... ... I need you and the Remora to be ready within the hour. Gentlemen, The press is already in a feeding frenzy about the hijacking. Especially with Senator Mavros on board. Not one word of this operation is to go beyond this room. Colonel. Anything you need, name it. Well sir, We'll need all the on-site intel we can get. And I think Mr. Grant could provide us with a great advantage. And I'd just love to have him come along. Mr grant. You ready to take a plane ride. . . . . .in the interest of national security? Of course. Sir. Check it out. Boys. It's the colonel. Didn't have details on the op Colonel. . . . . .so we brought everything, even the condoms. Who's this? 007? That's Mr. Grant. He is with lntelligence. He'll be travelling with us part of the way. Part of the way? Sir. I'll explain on the bird. Let's go! So where's the 1 30? Sergeant Baker. . . . . .I reckon that's it. Colonel, You're joking, right? That's too much gear. You got to cut it down. We will never get off the ground. Gotcha. All Right, Break it down, boys. Close-quarter weapons. . . . . .com units, ordinance, sleep agent. Dump the rest. Yes Sir. Andrews ground, Remora, hangar three, taxi for takeoff. It's all hooked up. Nazi. Oh, God. Allison's been gone a long time. They wouldn't leave her down there by herself. Something's wrong. All Right. Let's go through this. Baker, You are first, set up the com link with the delivery plane and the Pentagon. -Grant. you monitors. -But I stay here on this airplane. Right? That's correct. The Remora will refuel in flight, then set up a trailing paddle behind the 747. You'll be in direct contact with us via Video and Audio. Your assessment of Nagi's behavior will be essential to the Operation. I'll do what I can. All Right, Now. Once we find the bad guys. . . . . .we'll be going to Look for the DZ-5. If we find it, doc, you'll tap into the oxygen supply system . . . . .with the sleep agent. Lights out. We take the bird. Once we've taken control of the bird, and found the DZ-5, we'll divert. Any problems, any questions? No sir. Truly airbase Greenland's our best bet. Yeah. If the bomb has a short fuse. . . . . .then my Red ass'll rain over Greenland? I don't think so. Bud. I guess. That's why they pay me the big bucks. For what? To save your Red ass. That's what I want to hear ya. Dog. The safehouse in Trieste. . . . . .that was your intel, was not it. The nerve gas was there, Colonel. Operation was late. If you say so. I just hope your averages improve a Little. If you don't believe me. . . . . .what are you doing up here? Well. Who the hell else is going to do it? You? My men are hungry. I want to See you to it. The food's in the lower galley. I am going to have the use the elevator. All right. What about the passengers? They need something, especially the children. very Well, They may have beverages and use the bathrooms. I am holding you responsible. Anything suspicious will bring about repercussions. Understood? Yes. Oh! My God! Satellite tracking indicates our intercept here. That'll give you about 4 hours to complete your mission. Our target is the Avionics hatch near the nose of the plane. As soon as we lock in the position, I'll raise the sleeve. When it's pressurized, I'll open the hatch of the 747. When you're inside. I'll go back up and lock it. Baker got to go first. The alarm switch on the hatch has to be neutralized As soon as it opens. Just Tell him the procedure. I can't just tell somebody the procedure. It's not a B-52 with a docking collar up there. It's a 747 without one. Equalization process is critically delicate in this case. If the seal's not the proper vacuum. . . . . .both planes could decompress. Our mission's over. All right. This is what we are going to do. Baker is going to follow right behind you. As soon as the hatch opens, you hold us inside, so Baker can lock off that switch. As soon as we're on board, you can go down and reseal the hatch. Colonel I'll clip your circuit for you from the ladder. There is no reason for me to go on the plane. That's the way it's going to be. you donot understand. I'm an engineer-- That's it. Target sighted. Initiating approach. Climbing to flight level 3-8-5. Activating Doppler imaging system. Range: 1,000 meters and closing. 750. 500. 350. We are entering heavy turbulence. Mr. Cahill. Just Only eight to ten seconds of this. Colonel. We're entering the slipstream. In a moment it'll settle. See that path? Colonel. That's the sweet spot! We'll be on it in two seconds! We're ready, Mr. Cahill. Primary laser targeting. Switch to master. And locked. Switching to dorsal camera system. Range to target point. Thirty meters. Target point in sight. Call the approach. Mr. Cahill. Steady. Left 0.5. Forward one. Easy. You're right on it. You're right on it. Hold it right there. Lock. Prepare target for linkup. Extending the sleeve. -Activate. -Roger. Autopilot on. We're engaged. Mr. Cahill. Primary tunnel pressurized and stable. I'm going up. Baker, Do it. Seal looks good. We got a stable vacuum. I'm opening the outer hatch. -What's that, a short? -I don't know. Come on. Move it. Come on. Move your fat ass. Come on Your turn. Miley, Sir. A little bumpy. What's that light? That's a warning light. It's for an open outer hatch in the avionics room. That's impossible. The whole plane is pressurized. -Where is this room? -It's Below. It's under the first-class cabin. Rat, you're next. Doc, the bags. Hope there's a good movie on this flight. Cappy. All Right. Clear. Next. All right. Come on. Cappy. Where the hell is the clip? -Did you put the clip in? -It was there! You're on my shit list, Baker. Cappy, Hold up, we lost the clip. Let's go! Let's go! Got it! Come on! you son of a..... See, it went out. It's got to be a short. Why aren't we climbing? Come on, old man, move it. What the hell? Wind shear! Climb! Climb. We are passing 330! 320! What the hell is going on? We have to break off now! I can't hold the seal. We got to pull him up. Man. Grant. What the hell are you doing? Let's move it, Colonel. Now! Now! Now! He's unconscious! All Right, Get above him, Now. He can be Hold on. Grant, Pull him up! Get him out of there. Move it! Get above him. All Right. We got him. Now get out of there. Move. Why is she so goddamn heavy? Jesus, they're climbing! I'm climbing with them. Too much stress on the sleeve. We're losing pressure on the pump. The seals are going. The seals are going. Listen to me. Close the hatch now or we'll lose both planes. Come on. Colonel. Grab my hand. I can't hold it! Close the hatch. Close the Hatch. Lower the sleeve! Listen to me. Listen to me. Somebody has to Close the hatch now or we are all going to die. Do it Now. We're losing pressure. Colonel. We're not going to make it. You are. She's gone. Castle Rock, Big Eye Six. We lost contact with Hail Mary. Repeat, we have lost Contact. Big Eye Six, Castle Rock. Was delivery accomplished? Castle Rock, Can't say. Hail Mary was attempting delivery when contact Disintegrated. Did they make it onboard? If they did, they'll establish a link with us. Where's the fleet? The carrier group's heading to an intercept point in the Atlantic. Have them go to alert. I am going to have the check the equipment in the avionics room. Show me this room. There's a depression. A deformity of C-7. He's got a fractured vertebrae. Oh! Shit. We got to immobilize him. Excuse Me! Folks. Can you get to move over here, please? -Move! -Sorry About that. Hang on, Cappy, you old dog. Buddy, you got some morphine here. It's going to take care the pain. ASAP. Hey! Give me a break. You want to go down there. You Go... Quiet. Go. It's a fried circuit. It's an overload of some kind. It happens. Close it. Sure. Everything all right down there. Oh! Yeah! Just a blown circuit. Must've been the turbulence. Brat. What are we going to do? Hey! Baker. Get me the Pentagon on sat-com. The radio didn't make it. Then We have no way to tell them we're onboard. They'll think we're all dead. Shut up, Cahill. No, He's right. As far as they know, we went down with the delivery plane. The Pentagon is going to shoot us down. Maybe. We were their only option. Listen to me. We have to negotiate. We have to Tell Hassan the Pentagon knows his plan. . . . . .and they'll never be allowed to reach U.S. airspace. Cahill, Calm down. No, No....I'm fine. Listen, I know what I'm talking about here. We have to do this. It's our only chance. and Guess What? They've got to listen. That won't stop them. Get your hands off me! You're not going anywhere fatboy. Come on! I didn't sign up for this G.I. Joe bullshit. We don't need to do that. He'll be all right. Listen to me. There is no negotiating with Nagi Hassan. You Understand? If he knew we were down here, Right now, he'd just kill us all. So let's calm down, everybody. Just sit down and relax. So, With no way to communicate with Washington, Cherry's right. They are just going to blow us out of the sky, Any Minute, Now. No, No, They don't know we're not onboard either. Though, we can wait until the last possible second, hoping for a break. We've got some time. Baker, How much time before we hit U.S. airspace? Three hours, and 50 minutes. What's left of the gear? Well, We've lost the sat-com. . . . . .scanners, sleep agent. We've got maybe half the weapons, probes, mikes, nodes, bomb kit. That's it. It's vital you find Hassan. It all centers around him. All right. Mikes and probes first. Hook up Grant to the com board, See if he can locate his old friend Hassan. Now. Everything we need is right here. As soon as We locate their positions. . . . . .we blow the lights and go night optics. We hit them hard while they're still surprised. All Right, Come on. Let's get started. The bomb. Look, Civilian, We don't even know if there is a bomb. I am going to take over this plane. That's what Travis would do. I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job. Okay. But if that DZ-5's on board, there's going to a bomb attached to it. You Goddamn, Better Find it. Now, Once this plane took off, There is going to be no turning back. Hassan'd make sure of that. He's right. It could be a pressure-switch timer, I mean if you try to land the plane or change the altitude. . . . . .anything could set it off. You have to find it before they hit. We'll look for it while we're setting up. Get the tools and bomb kits. Let's get started. Tell me what Hassan looks like. No, I can't. What do you mean? You can't, I thought You said you are the world's expert on this guy. The only known photograph of him when he was a student taken over 25 years ago. Jesus. But I'd recognize his voice. I'd know him, if I saw him. I'm telling you, I saw them. Americans. Soldiers. Baker, Station One. First-class online. I got You, Go ahead. Okay, I've got one, first-class cabin. Now another. Skorpions on both of them. Grant, do you copy? I hear them. Neither one is Hassan. I got Four in the main cabin, two in the galley. Four with nine millimeter skorpions, two AKM/FNC's. I got Two more patrolling the rear cabin. Also Heavily armed. Can you hear them in the galley? Yeah. Yeah, I hear them. None of them is our man. This isn't working. Meet me in the lower galley. Put on Cappy's vest. I'm on my way. All right, Grant. clip the cable onto your vest. Now, Put on your carabiner. All Right. I am going to winch you up. Easy. All right. I got the four probes and mikes down there. It pretty much covers me in the main cabin. If he's there, you should find him. Now, Whatever you do. . . . . .don't step on the panel or you are going to go right through. I'll try to remember that. Hey, wait. Lose the shoes, pretty boy. Hope the smell doesn't give us away. Go. Senator, l think we...... Shut up! Do you want to get us killed? Senator, I think we're being presented with an incredible opportunity here. For what? You Know, We always wanted to have a war record for you. Some edge with the media that would put you over the top. yeah. Remember the mileage Jesse Jackson got. . . . . .when he negotiated the release of those hostages? Yeah. I'm at the last one. He's not here. Maybe he's in the cockpit. Okay. Come on back. Come on, I got you, Come on.. I got you, Come on. it's okay. All Right. That's it. Just keep tugging. Good. You got it. Get your arm in over there. Maintain current course. Shit. Thanks. Yeah. Come on. Let's get the hell down from here. All Right. Stop. What the hell is going on? I'm sorry, it fell. I was. . . . . .getting coffee filters. I don't understand. How does threatening these people. . . . . .have anything to do with your cause? Whatever it is. That it's not your place to understand. Just be patient. It'll all be over very soon. There's a change. Tell the captain to Maintain our course. Excuse me. I'm keeping you from your work. Grant, Are you okay? What happened? Grant. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. And guess who I ran into? Rat. Forward baggage compartment. Got something. All Right. I'm on my way. You wanted to talk to me. I'm sure you're aware the official U.S. policy is. . . . . .no deals with terrorists. Especially in hostage situations. I can deal directly with the President. If you allow me to conduct the negotiation. . . . . .I believe I can guarantee all your demands. Money, media exposure, safe passage back to the Middle East. I understand. You want to be seen as the savior of the hostages. An image that certainly won't hurt you in the coming elections. As powerful an image as you returning to the Middle East, your mission accomplished. I guess, Here. We are both men who truly understand. . . . . .the importance of making dramatic statements to.... Rest assured, when the time comes, I will call upon you. My Guess Your theory was right. Have a look. You can forget Washington. There's enough nerve agent here to wipe out half the eastern seaboard. Israeli intelligence has been certainly identified the bomb-maker. He's Jean-Paul Demou. That's a recent photograph. French-Algerian. Former nuclear engineer with the lraqis. Lost his family in the Gulf War. He's been with Jaffa's group ever since. That's it? That's it. Charles, It's been over an hour and no word from Travis. We're running out of options. There's still time. Better Instruct the F-14's to be ready to launch. Issue the press release of the President's decision to free Jaffa. That bastard might be our last avenue of hope. We have no means to communicate with him. But he has arranged to contact you at 6:30 as soon as you're airborne. I can assure you, that plane will never be allowed to reach the U.S. If you can convince him. . . . . .to divert the aircraft to an isolated base. . . . . .and release the passengers. . . . . .he has the word of the President of the United States. . . . . .he and his men will be given safe passage to a country of his choice. I'll do everything I can. . . . . .in the interests of peace. Sorry, Cappy. We got a bad one here. So. . . . . .we know we've got DZ-5 in binary canisters. . . . . .and 16 pounds of Semtex. Let's take a look inside. A computer trigger. Microprocessor. Dedicated drive. . . . . .probably monitor a dozen sensors. This ain't no pipe bomb with a six-volt battery. Take me closer. Stop. Take me in on that. Over right there. What are you looking at? That long, silver cylinder. That's a barometric pressure switch. Activated on takeoff, probably set to airburst during landing. . . . . .with an isolated trigger. I tell you what. . . . . .if I can. . . . . .I mean. . . . . .if you can disable the switch, it'll probably buy you some time. Then we got a chance. We got a chance. We shut this thing down, take over the plane. we just land someplace safe. Who gets to play with the bomb? What about Cahill? He's a design engineer. If he can build a computer. . . . . .he can take cappy's help and take one apart. Cappy, Cappy, What do you think? I think We're looking up the ass of a dead dog, but it's worth a try. But we got to hurry, Because this morphine's kicking in. Okay. Let's do it. Let's do it. Get Cahill in here. Louie, Overhead mid-cabin. Baker, First class. I am going to take the cockpit and business class. We're going on Cappy's Signal. Use Channel B to Grant, keep A open for assault. Rat. I think you got a problem here. I mean, I counted four in mid-cabin, but there maybe as may as six. Can you...Can you take them all? Well, I can take three or four, at the most but that's pushing it. We need another gun. What do you want me to do? Jesus. We're doing a simple electronic bypass. Just Ignore the rest of it. Just ignore. . . . . .the rest of it. If you screw up. you'll never know it. So. . . . . .Iet's get to it. Okay. Once more. Push hard, up the ladder. . . . . .Left in the companionway. I am going to surprise them. That's it. You got it. Rat. Really this isn't my thing. But donot worry, with that you can't miss. Just aim straight for his chest and fire. Whatever you do, don't look into his eyes. Okay. Then come back down the hall. Okay, Cahill. Meter reads 15 ohms. That's good. That means it's in parallel and isolated. Now, Let's complete the bypass. Now take the red alligator clips and set in the bypass. Now take the red-handled dikes. . . . . .and put the red wire on this side. But don't touch anything else. Ready, forward section. Louie, Sit-rep. Ready. Baker up. I'm ready. Do it. Tell them it's all theirs. Thank God. Cappy says the bomb is safe. Okay. The dude's in my sights. I'll blow the lights, and we go on my signal. Oh, Jesus! Cahill, Stop them. Stop Attack. Tell Rat to stop the attack. Rat, stop the hit. Cappy says stop the attack. Stop it now. Everybody hold their positions. Cappy, What's going on? Someone just ran a program test on the bomb. Whoever it is. . . . . .he has got an override switch with his finger. . . ...on the Goddamned trigger. Christ, Can you override it? Cappy, I said, can you override it? What the hell is going on? I......... think we might have lost Cappy. Cappy's dead. I think Cappy's dead. Cahill, Calm down. Rat, What happened? Rat, Cappy's okay. He is just unconscious. I am free and in flight. The Americans wish me to tell you. . . . . .they have agreed to all of your demands. You are victorious. Come home. I rejoice in your freedom, Abu Jaffa. Allah has blessed us. A great destiny awaits us both. And if You are, as you can see I've achieved a glorious victory on your behalf. All the people of lslam will embrace you as its chosen leader. I am your flame. The sword of Allah. And with it I will strike deep into the heart of the infidel. Nazi, Listen to me. They know. They will destroy the plane. Nazi, Listen. He cut him off. Christ. Jaffa's free. Jaffa's free. Anytime, guys. Anytime. Tell Admiral Crosby to order the F-14's to intercept the 747. Make the plane divert. I donot care what they have to do. Just, Do it. Jack, Call the President. It's an executive decision now. Now that Abu Jaffa's free, shall I order the plane to change course back to Algeria? But, Why? -What's going on? -Jaffa has been freed. Sounds like the second-in-command is challenging Hassan. He wants to know. . . . . .why they're not diverting to Algeria. . . . . .now that Jaffa has been released. Allah has chosen for us a task far greater than Jaffa's freedom. We are the true soldiers of lslam. Our destiny is to deliver the vengence of Allah. . . . . .into the belly of the infidel. This has nothing to do with lslam. This is not Allah's will. You're blinded by your hatred. And I'll have nothing to do with your plan. Our mission was to free Abu Jaffa. He is our leader, not you. What happened? He just killed one of his own men. Get back to your posts. You son of a bitch. What'd you get me into here, huh! What did you get me into? Well, the others can't know about the bomb. But somebody ran a test. I mean, there is got to be a sleeper. Triggerman. One of the passengers. There're 400 passengers. It could be anyone. Is there No way we'll find him. We still have the element of surprise. Let's hit them now, forget about that bomb and maybe we are going to get lucky. Even if you kill them all, the sleeper can still destroy the plane. But at least we'll save Washington. Look, We're out of time. This is the best option we have. Maybe not. We still got about an hour and 20 minutes. Listen to me, we got to give that bomb another try. Ahh! But, You need Cappy for that. Cahill might be able to fail. But He can.......Forget it. If he can neutralize it, and finding the sleeper wouldnot matter. Yeah. And if he can't neutralize it? Then we got to find the sleeper. But I think. . . . . .I think I know who it might be. Can you hook up a probe. . . . . .so I can see into the main cabin on this monitor? No, We can't transmit between the probe and the monitor. Would a video camera work? YEAH. -You got one? -No. Shit. Baggage. We'll find one in baggage. There are 400 faces up there. Did you expect to check each one? Not without help. So, Where's the weak link? How do we pull the teeth on this thing? Come on, Cahill, you're an engineer. Go with your instincts. Cappy said two power sources. And now this is one. And I'm pretty sure this is the other. Okay. Grant. If we had our own power supply. . . . . .we could isolate the bomb's power sources. . . . . .much Iike a heart bypass machine. The bomb'll still think it's online. Along with the sleeper. With no power, no way of detonation. It's Brilliant Cahill. In theory. This Point, That's all we've got. Okay. Cahill, you're the man. Go with your instincts. I..... hope I'm right. Whatever you do, don't cut that wire. Grant, We found a camcorder in baggage. We're about ready to try this. Yeah. Be right there. Where are you going? You can't leave me now. you donot need me. You've got Cappy. What if he passes out again? If things really get desperate. . . . . .use your magic wand. Okay. I got power. Got the cable down back side the elevator shaft. They will never see it. All Right. Now for the hard part. Let's try this. This is a button for the call light. I bypassed the buzzer. Let's hope she sees it. Wait. hold on a second. Wait a minute. Why her? What makes you think you can trust her? When I was in the elevator. . . . . .she saw me right when Hassan walked in. Oh! Christ. Wait..Wait...Wait. She was cool, she covered me. She'll do this. I Know it All Right, And I just hope you have better luck with women than I do. Come on, pick it up. Pick it up. I'm watching you on video. Behind you. . . ...above the bulkhead. There you go. We met in the elevator. Remember, Right. American soldiers are onboard, ready to take over the plane. But there's a bomb, and one of the passenger is in direct control of it. We need your help to find him. You're looking for a man with an electronic device. He's probably-- Sorry. I thought the phone rang. Oh! Jesus. Get on with it. Come on, hang in there. Now. Hang in there. She's had it. Forget it. Grant. She's shaking. She's not going to do it. Wait a minute. All Right, Lady's a player. Boys, She's with us. Right. Come on. Look, We Get in position. We Get upstairs. And watch it, If she fingers somebody, we are going to move fast. Come on. They're here. Oceanic Flight 343, approximately 120 miles from fail-safe line. I've just spoken to the President. He concurs. If we can't make them divert, we have no other option. The F-14's should intercept in approximately 15 minutes. We're not really going to shoot this plane down, are we? Whatever evidence there is, will straight go to the bottom in the Atlantic. The President would be finished. He'd never recover. Four hundred American lives. Christ, Jack, We'd all be finished, the whole administration. Miss, may I have some water for my medication? My pleasure. -Oh, dear. Oh! -I'll get it for you. What are you doing? I was just getting her medication. Can I go get her some water? Go! That's it. You got something, don't you? Not long enough. One something be... -Did you get it? -No, it was too quick. She'll give it to do us again. She has to. Here she comes. -2, 1 -- -"K. " 21 -K! Slap Flight, this is Lead. Contact 0-3-9 at 125.

I can't do it. I can't. . . . . .breathe. Just relax. I'm right here. Close your eyes. Why? Why am I closing my eyes? Just close your eyes. Take a deep breathe. Now. Open your eyes and cut the blue wire. It's a decoy. It's a fucking decoy. The whole thing are fake. The real works must be down below under the plate. What the hell just happened? What is going on? I'm sorry. It's just, after we have been screwed around up, the whole goddamn thing could just blow up. Please, Speak English. I screwed up. We have to start over. Grant, I'm there. If it's Demou, he's about 50... . . .olive skin, dark hair, slightly balding. It could be. I can't see him clearly. I can't even get a clean shot. What about you Louie? Well, His back is to me. But he fits the description. Demou. It has to be. Can you take him? Not a chance. These blocks by see........... There's passengers all around him. -Where the hell did they come from? -I don't know. Nagi, fighter planes. Slap, Strike One Tally Ho. Assuming position for escort. Oceanic Flight 343, this is flight leader, U.S. Navy aircraft. You are approaching U. S. airspace.

It's Great Cappy. Stay at it. All right, listen. Pin 77's over here. Slap Flight, this is Lead. I'm going to pull out in front. What are we missing here? I'm thinking the same thing.

This plane will continue on as planned. Any further threats will result in a passenger being killed every minute. They're only 25 miles to the fail-safe line. We have to end this now. Nav. Com. Flash on the CRN-1 1 5. National Command Authority. We're ordered to destroy the target. You got to be joking. I confirmed it twice. It's for real. Slap Two, Three and Four, take high cover.
