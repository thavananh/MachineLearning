foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Each Jerunei tells the tale of not only one soul, but three. For every burial a male sacrificial slave was thrown into the base to become a 'living pillar' for the Jerunei. That is why the International Heritage Association appointed us to research on this Jerunei, that long been hidden from the outside world by its heirs. Dr. Suraya Abdullah, - the greatest explorer of the century. - Stop it. And after the Jerunei was erected another female sacrificial slave, pre-chosen specially by the deceased, will be tied up at the top of the Jerunei. That slave was to be left to a slow and agonizing death from starvation and exhaustion. Now imagine the wrath of the souls who had been forcibly sacrificed. Such is the wrath that gave rise to the horrific Curse of the Jerunei. Chong, what did you do? Suraya. Suraya, now. - Why? - Chong, come here now! Suraya. Arjuna. You're getting better. Bee. Hi, Hana. Here. What is this? An ill omen. Bad sign. The Melanau tribe believes that owls, bats and snakes are bearers of calamity. Calamities that bring destruction, damage and death. Did Arjuna say anything? - About the expedition? - Yes. I think it would be better if you asked Dr. Sani. What do you want to ask? Bee. Good morning, Dr Sani. Dr. Sani! - Dr. Sani. - I've said it many times. It's been ages since I've gone on an expedition. But Dr. Sani, this is an important project for the Global Heritage Preservation Society. We don't want to miss out on even one Jerunei. Good. Go on. Hana and I aren't archaeologists. But Dr. Sani is the best expert that we could find. Dr. Sani, don't you feel touched - about this Jerunei? - Good morning. What's the history behind it, and why has it been kept a secret all this while? That's why I'm not interested in it. Miss Bee, are you sure it's a Jerunei? But that's the reason why. - What if. - What if? Miss Bee, are you wasting my time on an assumption. Wasting your time? You'd rather stay cooped up here than go out and prove that your theory was legit? Where's Sani Othman, who wrote this book? Why didn't you tell him about that team? Who knows? Maybe Dr. Sani will be willing to help, if he knows about the team's disappearance. Hana, we don't know what happened to the team before this. Okay. Now what? Now we should follow the original plan. Hopefully, an expert will help us. I can help as long as I'm appointed the expedition leader. Right now we're in the water tank room. And I will show you, ladies and gentlemen, the tank that was said to contain the corpse of the Bangladeshi officer. Tommi, Ghost Seeker. It's my channel, Tommi. - So this is your channel? - Subscribe to it. Bee, take a look at this. Are you okay? I forgot. You can't swim, right? It's not this. Calm down. Look at this YouTube video. This is Tommi's channel. - Who? - Yes. Tommi, Ghost Seeker. He was the one who went into the haunted house near our office. He even managed to get a selfie. Bee, you. You two sit quietly, okay? She went crazy. We're just kidding, Bee. There are kids over there. Kids. Children! Go home! Don't rebuke people who mess up our ancestors' Jerunei. What happened. You're so quick. Arjuna. Bee, it's okay. We're safe now, okay? Bags? Okay, all of them are here. Hello. Is this the village head's house? Sir. Is this the village head's house? Sir? Sir. Sir! Where is the village head? Excuse me, Miss. Is this the village head's house? Miss, please smile. Smile. How exotic. -Enough -Miss, is this the village head's house? Miss. You're not welcome here I don't understand. You're not welcome here. Get out. - Where is Bee? - Why are you so late? We've been here for ages. Bee, have you found the village head's house? - Bee? - Are you all right? I'm okay. It's dusty down there. Hello! Are you from the Global Heritage Society? I'm the village head. My name is Madui. Follow me. You went underneath the house just now, did you? Thank goodness you weren't cursed. Cursed? Nula has gone crazy. She's lost her mind. Her dad was a bayoh. - Bayoh? - A shaman. They said Nula was born using some spells. Her dad disappeared when she was a kid. But now she's spreading the spells everywhere. The spells contain evil vibes. If possible, stay away from her. Is there a real shaman? I want to interview him. Don't talk about this topic in my house. Okay? Anyway, your friend had waited a long time. Come. - Which friend? - Friend? Please come in. - Move your hand. - I'm sorry. Come in. Go on. What is this? It's umai. - Raw fish. - Eat up. It's like sushi. Haven't you tried it before? Listen up I want to thank all of you for your effort in making the old Jerunei a global heritage site. We were just doing our duty. With the Global Heritage Society's acknowledgement. The Global Heritage Society's acknowledgement made us believe this village could develop further, whether in terms of upholding the traditions or introducing the customs of the Melanau tribe to the younger generation. That's right. Miss Bee, please serve us some rice. - Give her a plate. - Thank you. Let's eat, everyone. Eat up. What's moving over there? It's our specialty. Sago worms. Eat up. You don't want it? You don't want to give it a try? -You try it -It's okay. Any news? I've tried searching. My men had also gone in to look as soon as I received your call, Miss Bee. But the forest is big, Miss Bee. Even the locals sometimes get lost in there. Then hire more people. Expand the search area. The cost is high, Miss Bee. Money isn't the problem right now. Most importantly, we shouldn't give up. The lives of those who disappeared are my responsibility. Alright? It's so pretty. Where did you catch it? Okay, are you ready? My assistant will bring you to the old house. Isn't the village head coming along? The village head and his family are not allowed to go near the Jerunei. - Why? - Customs. It's been practiced since time immemorial. But why? I don't know why either. It's a tradition that has been here for generations. Okay. If you're all ready. - Let's get going now. - Okay. Where is Bee right now? Bee. - Everyone is waiting for you. - Come on. Bee. Where did you go? I couldn't get through to you. Did you turn off your phone? This is the person who's late today. Are you okay? I saw a girl just now. What girl? - Stop spouting nonsense, Bee. - Yes. You're playing the fool. Hana, this is the girl I was telling you about. Bee. Stop fooling around. Who are you staring at? There was a girl. The same girl. Bee, this isn't funny. Okay, let's go. Come on, let's go. Come. Bee, come on. This is it. You'll be on your own from here. Thanks. Where are you going? Hey! Hey, friend! This is definitely the previous team's base. Great, we have something to do now. We'll spend the night here. Keep your belongings up there. Now, Tommi. Find the generator and start it up. I will not let you set foot in this house, because there is a doorkeeper here. She has disobeyed us and the spirits. She is Matalau, who is bent on ruining it. This house had been abandoned for years. Abandoned doesn't mean that it's not occupied. This house belonged to the head hunters. And it is said that they used to hang the skulls here. But after a dreadful storm one day, the skulls disappeared and all the occupants of this house died. According to the villagers, the skulls became evil and sought revenge on the entire household. My dear viewers. You... Why didn't you start up the generator? Didn't I already tell you to do it? How dare you order me around. - Do you think you're still our leader? - It's okay. I will go. Interrupting my work. Why, Miss Bee? Are you okay, Miss Bee? Be careful. I was just trying my luck, but she's gone. At least, I could watch this. They bathed with the water from here? It's so cold. How could they bathe in it? I can't possibly bathe with this. Goodnight, Bee. Goodnight. "The person who is sacrificed on the Jerunei will be bound to his master and his descendants forever. The ties would not loosen." What are you trying to say, honey? If that place is haunted, it will start giving a warning sound and its light will turn on. Let's give it a try. There's nothing. See that? Did you see that? So, it's true that a virgin ghost roams here, just like the villagers said. So let me ask you a question, okay? Answer me honestly. When you are dead, do you want to be served by a virgin or the opposite? I prefer someone who is experienced. It's because a virgin is useless. Do you agree? They are inexperienced. They can't serve well. If you disagree with me, then leave your comments below. Or you could criticize me all you want. I don't care, okay? Tommi, Ghost Seeker. You're awesome, Tommi. I admit that I'm not a good husband to you. - What are you doing? - Suraya. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey. What have you done? I found the manual. The text that you wanted to decipher. The text is the key to everything. Go. I came to bring you home. Go. Suraya. I need to go to the bathroom. Bee. Bee, come with me to the bathroom. Bee, please come with me to the bathroom. Why? Are you okay? - Come with me to the bathroom. - Okay. - Let's go. - Come. Bee. That wasn't me. Where did you go? Tell us before you go anywhere. There's another one. What happened? You look like a buffalo who has wallowed in the mud. Stop wasting time. Let's get moving to the Jerunei site. Wait a while. Do you all still want to stay here? This place is haunted. Let's go back. Maybe it was just some bad prank, like in a reality show. What kind of reality show? I smell like a rotting corpse. It's just a smell. I nearly drowned, idiot I said so. I suggested we slept near each other, but you didn't want to. Then this happened. - You. - Forget it! If you want to leave, you can. But we will continue with our plan. If you want to leave, we'll meet you at the village head's house, okay? Okay. Arjuna, do you want to leave? Bee, are you going to stay here? Hana, I have my responsibilities. Fine. I will go back alone. All of you are crazy. I don't get it. Move aside. You're blocking me. Why didn't you ask me to go back? Who knows? Maybe I wanted to go back. Don't look for me if anything happens. How gloomy. A river. It's not stationary. It's always moving according to the movement of time. Think about it. When this Jerunei was built long ago, there was certainly a river next to it. But based on findings, the rivers in Borneo move six feet a year. This Jerunei is 833 years old? This is probably the oldest Jerunei in the world. Okay. If I could prove it, then this would be the greatest archaeological discovery of this era. No, you can't. The radiocarbon test. We just take a small sample and send it to the lab. No way. We can't touch anything if we want it certified as a heritage site, and I made an agreement with the Native Customs Council. Hello! Hello! Dr. Sani, Bee. -Bee -Hana? Haven't you already been to Madui's house? Bee, this is crazy. Let's go home. I don't want to stay here. Come on. Be patient. We can go home once we finish our work here. Okay? Hana, don't bother going back. You'll come here again. Forget it. - Hana. - In that hole. - Why? - There's a face. Bee, there's a face. Ghost. Gosh, it's just a bat. Okay, listen. It's just a bat. There's nothing. There's nothing. No, I know what I saw. Come on. Let's take a seat. What's the matter with you? You shouldn't be too afraid of such spirits. People say we must be strong-willed, just like me. I'm used to going to haunted places. I'd never been disturbed. I'm strong-willed. Strong-willed, my foot! - Enough. - No. - Let's continue our work. - Hana. Don't be bothered by him. "The Jerunei will be bound to his master and his descendants. The ties would not loosen." Matalau. Death is not an ending. It is a beginning. And you will always be my daughter. I'll have no one else after this. No family. You're my only family. Who am I but just a slave? You were still a baby when I found you. Before that I often prayed and asked why the higher forces didn't bestow a daughter on me. I know now that you're a blessing from them. My son, ensure that my will is executed. Ensure Matalau lives free. Take care of your sister. Arjuna. Arjuna, what are you doing? Arjuna! Arjuna! Arjuna! Come here. Okay. I will attend to you. Bee. Bee, I don't care. I want to go back. Come on, Bee. - We should go back. - You guys go ahead. Don't you know already? - No. - How do we get back to the village? Don't worry. I will follow you. Bring Arjuna along. He needs medical attention. He needs to be brought to the base camp. Let's meet at Madui's. We'll split up. Okay, come. Let's go. - Bee. Come. - Bee! Goodness! I forgot to record this incident! All of you. Hana, where are you going? Hana! Hey, wait up! Don't look! Don't look! Don't look! No. Don't look. Hana! Where is the path? Dr. Sani! I will count to three, okay? One. Two. Enough. We should bring him to the base camp. I need more of your guidance and authority over them! Give it to me, so that I'm stronger! You are my best protector oh Lord! Don't worry. I will meet with Nula tomorrow. I think Dr. Sani and the rest of them will be returning here. So it's better for you to stay here. I promise that you'll be safe with me. It's done. Get some rest. Thank you. Hence, any Jerunei that has withstood the trials of time and still exist today must be preserved. Dr. Suraya Abdullah - the greatest explorer of the century. - Stop it. The Global Heritage Society has brought us in to examine Jerunei. Suraya. Suraya! Suraya! Suraya, hurry up. What's wrong Chong, come here now! Keep it back. Just pretend that you didn't see it Dr. Sani's ex-wife was really here. Keep it back. It's about human lives. This is proof. They disappeared. There's something weird here. And that's what is giving me a hard time. And it's all because you want to sell off the customary land, don't you? Hana. Where are you going? Over there. -Dr. Sani -Just walk. Just walk. Go on. Go on. Go on. Where is Bee? It's okay. We'll return to the base camp now. Okay. Sit here. Here. These... These are the expedition members who were said to have disappeared. They did not disappear. Instead, they were found dead. My condolences to the families of the victims, and we promise to bring back all the bodies. Gosh. Dr. Sani. There was a bat here. And a snake. I'm worried, Dr. Sani. I'm worried. All these are omens. Ill omens. We must find Bee. - We must find Bee. - No. Sit, sit. I will look for her and return here. Dr. Sani. Wait. Bee! Bee, thank goodness I found you. Bee, Hana was right. This place makes me wet my pants. Thank goodness, I found you. Bee? Bee? Bee. Bee... Bee. Aren't you going to try it out to see if it's good? Bee! Bee! Bee. Spirits. Please save the innocent lives. They don't know what they are doing. Please. Your servant is begging you. Free them of Matalau's curse. I'm sorry, honey. I HAVE FOUND WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR ALL THIS TIME. WHEN ARE YOU RETURNING FROM KUCHING? I promise. I will search till I find you. Bee. Help! Hana, Hana. Where are you going? This forest belongs to me I know every nook and cranny. Bee! Bee. Let's get out of here. Bee. Please. Help! Help! Help. Please. No. Please. No. Nobody has to know. Bee. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. What have I done wrong? No! Stop! No. No. No, I don't want to! No! Push it up. Push up more. Push up more and pull the rope. Don't touch me! - I don't want to. - Go. No, I don't want to. Wait. Matalau, you're Gebu'ong Ulau's favorite slave. I'll grant him his final wishes now. You will join him as his slave into the afterlife. You were there. You heard his will. Oh, my dear sunshine you're like my little sister. But you're also the favorite slave of the late village head. The late village head has chosen you as the sacrifice. Liar. I curse all of you who tortured me for the sins that I had never committed. I curse that none of your sons and your future generations are... safe. Give me a lot of power. WHEN THE DESCENDANT EXIST Your servant is begging you. Free them of Matalau's curse. The blood of the village head flows for generations. Defiled by betrayal and deception. Bee. Help. Dr. Sani, help! I don't want to die! Help. Help I don't want to die! I'm innocent! Help I could smell the blood of the old village head flowing in you. Bee, let him go. Tell him how you slaughtered Hana and let Suraya rot in the forest. What is she saying, Madui? What is she saying? Run, Dr. Sani. Run I'm afraid she'll return, Dr. Sani. Run now! What have you done to my wife? What have you done to my wife? I saw Suraya dying in front of me. But remember, this is my land. No one can escape from here. Dr. Sani. Dr. Sani. I found Dr. Suraya's text. "The ties would not loosen when descendants exist." The last descendant. Run, run! - Dr. Sani, run now! - Bee. Bee, come here. Liar. Stop! Kill. Kill them all. Kill. Follow me if you want to live. The slave must bow to her master's wishes. Her powers are linked to the Jerunei. Come now before you become the victim. No. Help me save them. I'm sorry, Matalau's spirit will not be appeased as long as the descendant is still alive. She may be your slave, but I am not. This Jerunei is definitely different from the rest. ENDING Many had sacrificed their time, energy and even their lives to ensure this Jerunei stood tall and was known throughout the world. The lives of my colleagues. The lives of my friends. Those who had disappeared. My condolences. I hope that this Jerunei and the legend of Matalau will remind us all that the lives of human beings are most valuable of all. - Please, Your Honor and Tan Sri. - Okay. Be patient, Hana. Be patient. Hold on a little longer. Be patient. Just a little longer. Yes Hana, be patient. Hold on a little longer, Hana. Just a little longer. He who has been sacrificed at the Jerunei will be bound to his master and his descendants. The ties will not loosen. The ties will not loosen while descendants exist. The last descendant. THE END
