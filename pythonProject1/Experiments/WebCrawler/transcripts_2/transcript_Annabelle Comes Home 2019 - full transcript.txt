foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- It was a big mistake acknowledging this doll. And through that, the inhuman spirit tricked you. You gave it permission to infest your lives. What's an inhuman spirit? It's something that's never walked the earth in human form. It's something demonic. So, the doll was never possessed? No, it was used as a conduit. It was moved around to give the impression of possession. Demonic spirits don't possess things. They possess people. It wanted to get inside of you. And given this unusual feature, the doll will need to be properly cared for. - Cared for? - Mmm-hmm. It should be destroyed. That would only make things worse. We think it best the doll come with us. We'll keep it somewhere safe. That sounds like a great idea. She's all yours. ♪ Now that you're gone ♪ ♪ All that's left is a band of gold ♪ ♪ All that's left of ♪ - ♪ The dreams I hold ♪ - ♪ The dreams I hold ♪ ♪ Is a band of gold ♪ ♪ And the memories ♪ ♪ Of what love could be ♪ How much longer, do you think? Eh, about an hour. Why don't you put your head back? Get some rest. No, you get lost coming home from the supermarket. If I do that, we might end up in California. Well, so you wake up to the sound of the Pacific. Nothing wrong with that. I'll pick up Judy on the way. Ah, that actually sounds so nice, Ed. We should plan on it. Uh-oh. What's this? You folks need to turn around. Pretty bad accident up ahead. Uh, anything we can do? You a doctor or something? Or something. He just meant if you need an extra set of hands. Yeah. We got it covered. Thanks. Nice doll. That's what you think. All right, you're gonna head three miles back to the last exit. You'll hop on 26, that'll loop you around. - 26. Got it. - Thank you, Officer. A guy and his doll. I think we missed our turn. We didn't miss it. Bridgewater's just up ahead. Bridgewater? Old Ridge Road. Where did you get Bridgewater from? Well, you know what? I think we missed our turn. I'll keep my eye out for the Pacific. Ed? - Ed? - Hang on, hang on. - Come on. - What just happened? Uh... I'll pop the hood and find out. Well, be careful. There we go. I like your doll. I feel cold. You were just in an accident. I was? Sorry. Wires crossed. That should do it. Honey, you okay? Ed! I'm okay. I'm so sorry! All of a sudden it was like somebody took over my truck. I had no control. Are you okay? I'm fine. It's the doll, Ed. It's a beacon for other spirits. Over here. Father, sooner the better. Yeah? Yeah. Be not wise in thine own eyes. Fear the Lord and depart from evil. The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked. But He blesseth the habitation of the just. Surely, He scorneth the scorners, but He giveth grace unto the lowly. The wise shall inherit the glory, but shame shall be the promotion of fools. Amen. We need another barrier of protection. A holy one. I agree. The blessing will only do so much. That chapel glass we got from Trinity Church before it was torn down, where is that? "Let us forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil." Amen. Did it work? Hmm. The evil is contained. ♪ Colorful, magical ♪ ♪ Wonderful, wow! ♪ ♪ The Captain is coming Just look at him now ♪ ♪ Super sensational, special And new ♪ ♪ The Captain is coming With something for you ♪ ♪ Here comes Captain Kangaroo ♪ Okay, Judy.

Yeah. - So, you'll... - Behave? Yes. And you'll remember to go to... Remember to go to bed on time. Absolutely. - All right, don't forget to... - To have fun. - I know. - That, too. Did you guys rehearse that, or what? Earth to Judy! What's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. Well, it's just a couple more hours until the weekend. I'm gonna run to the market for supplies during my free period. I'll pick you up after, okay? Sounds super. Bye, Judy! Have a good day! Mrs. Faley, it's right over here. Let me show you. How could you not tell me what the Warrens did for a living? Shouldn't you be in math class? Mary Ellen! I babysat the Smiths for over two years and never told you what they did. Oh, what do they do? They're podiatrists. So not the same. Well, obviously, I'm coming over later. We do have that social studies project - that we need to work on. - Uh... We don't have any project. Okay, but how would they know? She's psychic. Then, they're heroes. I think they're concerned parents who wouldn't want negative influences around their child. What negative influence? 'Cause I sometimes stay out past curfew? Among other things. So, what's it like inside the house? Is it all creepy music and cobwebs? No. No, it's boring suburbia. The inside of your locker is scarier. Wait. Whose party, and why wasn't I invited? Judy's birthday is coming up, so we're gonna celebrate early. You really are the best babysitter, you know that? Compliments will get you nowhere. What about threats? Did you, uh, happen to notice who's working checkout? - Have a good one. - Will do. - Thank you so much. - See you soon. You wouldn't. You know what they call him, right? - Have a good one. - What? Bob's-Got-Balls. How you doing? Hi, Daniela. Uh... - Hi, Mary Ellen. - Is this everything? - I think so. - Oh, cool. You live near the Warrens, don't you, Bob? Uh... Yeah, Mary Ellen's babysitting for them tonight. Yeah. Yeah, I live right across the street. Do you ever see anything scary over there? Like a ghost, maybe? Bob... Mrs. Faley went ahead and dropped a can of tomato sauce in aisle five, and it looks like a crime scene, so get the mop. Ladies. Did you find everything okay? - Mmm-hmm. - Yes, sir. Bob here is not giving you any trouble, is he? - No. - No. - Yeah, I got it. Thanks, Dad. - All right. I'll do it right after. So, what'd you see? At the Warrens'? Uh, nothing. Nothing. Um, your total is $3.50, so... Oh. But you knew what the Warrens did? There were rumors, I guess, but... Rumors. Interesting. Did you know there's a rumor going around about you, Bob? - Wait, really? - What is it about? Uh, it's about a girl who has a... Fine. You can come. Stop. - Oh. Sorry. - Sorry. - That's totally my fault. - It's okay. Um... So, what... Bye, Bob. Thanks. Bye. Uh, she forgot her eggs, so... Here. She likes you. There's been an accident. Don't touch her. You'll get obsessed. - It's "possessed." - That's what I said. Anyways, if you know so much, why don't you tell us if you can catch cooties from a ghost? You can't. Well, then how'd you get 'em? Anthony Rios! Don't make me get your sister. Please don't. Then go. All of you. Come on. Come on. Let's go! I'm sorry I can't come to your birthday party, Judy. You can't either? My parents said I'm not really prepared to process death yet. It's a birthday party. I'm sorry. Hey, how long has that been happening? Since everyone heard about the article this week. Please don't tell my parents. I won't. I won't as long as you do. - I don't want them to worry. - They're parents. They're worried about everything whether they need to be or not. Are you sure the bullying is the only thing that's bothering you? That isn't bothering me. You know what I mean. And remember our deal. No secrets. I know. I don't have any. What did you get at the store? A surprise. - You said no secrets. - A surprise isn't a secret. - What is it then? - It's a surprise. ♪ I remember Finding out about you ♪ You're gonna make a mess. Hey! Save some for the cake. No. I think there's someone at the door. I was knocking on the door for, like, ten minutes. How did you even get in? Back door. Is this a spirit bell? What's a spirit bell? It tells you if you're in the presence of any spirits. - So, it is one. - No. It's just a bell. My mom collects them. Oh. Who are you? She's Daniela, and she leaves after cake. Oh, good! I love cake. So, Judy. Don't your parents, like, keep any creepy stuff around? No. They keep it all locked away in a room. Well, can we at least go in and look? No! It's not really good for anyone to go in there. How come? Just isn't. Wait. Here. Birthday present. What is it? Look inside. How did you even afford those? They're my old ones. But I only ever used them once 'cause I broke my arm the first time I put them on. You're kidding. She looks way more coordinated. They're gonna ruin the floors. Can we go around the block, then? - I don't think... - Good idea. You guys go. I'll watch the cake and make sure it doesn't burn. Fine. But don't snoop. Don't touch. Don't do anything. Please? Stay in the kitchen. Promise me. I promise. Fuck it. I am calling out to the spirits on the other side. Please unlock this door and let me in. Shit. Please don't judge me. Amen. Whoa. Whoa. What'd you do to get in there? If there is a presence here in this room, please give me a sign. Any sign at all. Dad? This is stupid. Shit. You burnt the cake? Daniela. Only the top. Just put frosting on it. She'll never know. How'd it go with the skates? She loved them until she fell on the way back and skinned her knee. Better than breaking her arm. Where is she anyway? She's out feeding the chickens. They have chickens? Hey. How's your knee? Oh. Looks like your jeans will at least need some stitches. It's okay. Accidents happen. So, are you scared yet? Scared? What? No. Who says they're scared? Kids in my class. Anthony Rios started it. I hate him. Wait. Tony Rios started it? Do you know him? Yeah, he's my brother. Anthony Rios is your brother? Yeah, I know. Don't hold it against me. I don't like him either. You know, he still wets the bed. You didn't hear it from me. Or maybe you did, I don't care. Still, just... go a little easy on him. It's been a tough year. You lost somebody, didn't you? My dad. Uh... Did Mary Ellen tell you? No. I just knew. Um, for delivery. Could I do one large, please? Um, it's gonna be 3506 Wayman Street. Oh, perfect. Thank you. Coming. Hold your horses. Who is it? Hello? Daniela? Is Annabelle there? Who? Can Annabelle come out to play? I think you have the wrong house. There's no Annabelle here. Yes, she is. She's right behind you. People are just... They're really weird about death. That's probably why the kids pick on you at school. It scares them. They treat it like it's some disease they don't wanna get, even though everyone already has it. But here's the thing. I used to think it was fatal and whammo. It's, like, out. Like turning off a TV. Then I learned about your parents and their whole exploration into the afterlife and stuff... and they gave me hope. That maybe life goes on somehow. Maybe... my darling dad is still out there somewhere. "Darling dad"? It was a thing. He was darling dad, and I was darling Daniela... Stupid. He's still out there, you know. You think so? My parents would say he is, too. Where are you going? Be right back. Dad? Daniela? Daniela! Where did she go? What are you doing? Daniela, you're not supposed to go down there! - What are you doing? - I thought I saw something. What did you see? Forget it. It doesn't matter. Judy? Judy? Judy? Judy? In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust. Let me never be put to confusion. Deliver me into Thy righteousness and cause me to escape. Incline Thine ear... Hey! Hey, Judy! Judy. What's going on? What's wrong? What's going on? What happened? Nothing. Judy... I just got scared. Scared of what? Sometimes... I see things. Like how my mom sees things. You mean like ghosts? Where do you see them? Everywhere I go. Judy... Ghosts used to be people. And not every person you meet is bad... so maybe not all ghosts are bad, either. Daniela. - You have to see this. - What? It's this case the Warrens investigated about this girl who was terrorized by something called the Ferryman. Here's a picture of the girl he killed. Look familiar? I mean, you two could be sisters. Here's the rest of the file, if you want to take a look. Look at all this stuff. How cool. Okay, this is the file on the Black Shuck. The Black Shuck? It was a case the Warrens investigated about a hellhound that possessed a man in England. He terrorized the shit out of this town. What's with the coins over their eyes? What? Oh, I don't know. I didn't get that far. They used to put them over the eyes of the dead to pay the Ferryman, so he could take their souls to the underworld. It was his toll. Okay, we should go. It's okay. I sometimes like to snoop, too. Do you know what this does, Judy? I think it's called a Mourner's Bracelet. It helps you contact your lost loved ones. - What's that? - Um... It's a case my parents investigated recently. The wedding dress. It haunts people. And it makes them violent. Where is the dress now? Down the hall in the artifact room. I mean, that's where all this stuff is. Right, Judy? - That's what you said earlier. - Oh, um... Yeah. My dad says that everything in there is either haunted, cursed, or used in some ritualistic practice. What about the doll that's in there? Because I read this interview with your dad... No. Don't talk about her. Why not? She's in a case for a reason. Okay, we should go. I wonder what's on this. No, Daniela! Wait! I command you, unclean spirit, along with all your minions... I command you to obey me to the letter! Okay, show's over. Let's go do something else. Do something that's actually appropriate. Come on, don't you at least wanna hear about the samurai? What about this one? I don't remember that one. How do you play? Let's find out. Okay. Okay, so you draw a card and whatever picture it has on it is the object you try to find by feeling around inside the box. If the object you pull out matches the picture, then you get a point. You go first. Okay. You gonna get that? Yeah. Sorry, you guys keep playing. Oh, got a point. Nice. Hello? Hi, Mary Ellen. Hi. Remember how, at the store, Daniela said that you were babysitting here? Yeah. Yeah. Me, too. Anyways, that's why I'm here. Oh. Bob, they don't really want me having boys over. No, that's not what I meant. I don't wanna come in. I just, uh... I mean, I would, but... Well... I just knew you were gonna be here, and I just wanted to come by and talk to you without my stupid dad or somebody interrupting. Bob's-Got-Balls! Nice. You two sharing some pizza? - I should get the money. - Yeah. Are you two, like... I... I wish. You know you need to, like, woo her, right? - Woo her? - Yeah. Guys like Mary Ellen, they need to be wooed. You mean girls like Mary Ellen. What did I say? Guys. So, how do I woo her? There's only one way to woo. It's obvious. Rock and roll. Here. Keep it. Sweet. Thanks, and that means you can keep this. Minus one slice. I enjoyed that in the car. See you later, Balls. I would invite you in, but like I said... No, yeah, it's cool. I thought I'd just stop by and say hi, I guess, so... I'm glad you did. Me, too. Hey, Bob, um... How come they call you that? Um... Well, you know how I'm the equipments manager for the basketball team? - Yeah. - That's why. There's not really, like, a story or anything behind it. Just like, "Hey, I need balls." I'm, like, "I got it. Balls. Got 'em." I'll see woo later. You. You. I'll see you later. I'm gonna go. Bye, Bob. Bye. All right, Carolyn, even a fortune teller couldn't have predicted the place we picked for your date with Don. Because who could ever have dreamed up a place as unbelievably fabulus as Las Vegas, Nevada? Yes, "amazing" is the word for it. You'll be flying off for a fling at the fabulous town of Las Vegas, to be guests of the fantastic Flamingo Hotel, a favorite spot along the Vegas Strip. And, Dawn, as a little special gift for you...

Good morning. Where's my coffee? Just a second. He had silver coins for his eyes. She said his light shows you the way to the land of the dead. I just wanna find my sister. And when did she first see him? Not long before he took her. She said she'd wake up, and he'd be in her room... watching her sleep. The night she went missing, we both woke up to a noise. It sounded like a coin falling on the floor. She told me to wait in her room. So I did. She never came back. I went to look for her and ended up in a long hallway. Filled with coffins. Last night... I woke up to a noise. Another coin being dropped. It was like he was... Like he was calling me. Have you ever seen the Ferryman? If you don't pay his toll, he'll take your soul. If you don't pay his toll, he'll take your soul. If you don't pay his toll, he'll take your soul. If you don't pay his toll, he'll take your soul. If you don't pay his toll, he'll take your soul.

Kind of. Maybe we should talk about this somewhere else. Good morning from the staff of WPKW-PV6 in Hartford, Connecticut. This is Hartford, Connecticut, the land of steady habits... My parents. Shit! You're not supposed to have boys over. I think that's the least of our concerns right now, Bob. Yeah, yeah. I should probably still get going.

Happy birthday, Judy. - Anthony? - I'm really sorry. Am I still invited? Sure. Daniela? I have something for you. For me? You found out the hard way that there is a lot of evil in this room. But you know what I actually like about it? All the evil in here... reminds me of all the good that's out there. Darling Daniela. Did Judy tell you that? No. Your dad did. He also tells me that he misses you. And to stop being so hard on yourself, 'cause it was not your fault. Thank you. Um... I'm sorry. Oh. It's okay. You're young. You know, when I was about your age, I once ran off with a boyfriend for three days without telling my parents. I unleashed a demon. So not the same thing. Well, okay. True. Does Mr. Warren know about this boyfriend? He was the boyfriend. Anybody wanna hear a song? Whoa! Yeah!
