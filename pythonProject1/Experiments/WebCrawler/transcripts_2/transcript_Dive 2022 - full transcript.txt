Carlos, check Tizoc out. - Come on, girls! - Very good entry. - Hey, how did you feel? - Good. - A bit weak. - No, it was good. Don't relax, just flex. Tizoc Reyes, silver medalist of the last Pan American Games. Ten! Come on, Tizoc! Judges? Seven point five, eight, seven. Seven point five, seven point five. Eight, seven point five. One, two. Let's start with women's 10m synchronized diving. From Mexico City, Mariel Saenz and Alejandra Moreno. Forward somersault with one-half twist in position B. - Ready? - Ready. One, two. Get her out! Quickly! - Get her out! - Doctor! Patient with probable spinal cord injury. Copy, on standby. AMBULANCE - I'm coming. - What are you doing, Mariel? - Everybody's arriving now. - I said I'm coming. Welcome! - Where's the birthday girl? - Today is... - So silly! - What did you do? He's swimming the 100m butterfly in a minute... Hi! You're not silly at all! - Of course it has! - Gold for gold. - Don't disappoint me. - Let's see the video. Sure! - Hey, how's Ale doing? - She's fine. What did the doctor say? Cut that, girl! Let's see the video! Video! At just 15 years old, Mariel Saenz already has an Olympic medal. No fear! - Mom, that's you! - Yes, it's me, honey. You two are very much alike. A great achievement for Mexico's sport! And that's it! Mariel Saenz wins an Olympic bronze medal. - There's my girl! - You were so young! Mariel Saenz is ready for a new challenge. She's a rising star for our country! This jump will define Mexico's type of medal. - Where are you going? - I know it by heart, mom. - We want the gold! - Shut up! What are you doing? It's the best part of the video. I know. - Want some? - No. When is Ale coming back? She sprained her neck and pulled her triceps. No. - She won't train for a while. - Will she go to the FINA Cup? No. If we don't go to the FINA Cup, we won't qualify for the Olympics! Calm down! Hey, you and Ale earned a place in the FINA Cup with your victory at the Pan Am Games. So don't worry, the places are guaranteed. But not necessarily for you two. What do you mean? Mariel, don't be so childish, you're not a child. You know perfectly well what I mean. Those places don't belong to specific people. Those places are for Mexico. The Federation decides who they're for. Sure, yes. - So? - So you will be diving for the Cup. But not with Ale. With who? There's a very talented young girl whose 10m dive is awesome. A girl? How old is she? Like you in Barcelona, 14. Are you kidding me? You can't compare! Are you the only prodigy in the world? These will be my last Olympics, Braulio! I'll be 30 in the next ones and I won't be able to compete. The injury took me out of Sydney, I lost the bronze in the last ones. I won't get another chance. I don't want to ruin it with a girl who doesn't know what she's doing. I've been coaching her for one year. Only one year? So in one year she's learned what she needs to compete against the world's elite? If I'm telling you she can do it, it's because she can. No, you just want her to get experience and you're putting her with me so she can go to her first cup. No, honey, I want you to put the Mexican team before your stupid ego. I don't want to look like a fool in Athens with a dumb girl. - I won't compete in those conditions. - All right. Don't do it. And that's it. Seriously, Braulio? Seriously, Mariel. Instead of one, I'll get two. I'm sorry, we don't have this kind of antibiotics. I can check with the other stores. Two bottles of Tylenol, please. You can pay at the cash register. 60 pesos, please. Tizoc, and the rest of the team? In the pool. They want to become artists. As the team has to keep going, we've invited a very talented girl to be Mariel's partner. Her name is Nadia and she's 14, she's brilliant. Nadia! She's 14, just the same age Mariel was. Look, this is Pati. - Hi, Nadia, how are you? - Good. How do you feel here? It feels like a dream. Fuck. - Are you okay, Mariel? - Yes. Just a fucking cramp. It's the third urinary infection in two months. Wait, I'll sterilize this. Let's see. Spread. Spread more. I know it hurts, but you have to trust me. If I don't do it now, it'll get worse later. There you go. - Better? - Yes. Okay, can you get down a bit, please? Don't stop taking the antibiotics in the middle of the treatment. How many times have we been through this? How come you keep getting in trouble? If the infection affects your kidneys, it'll get complicated. What you're doing is dangerous, you can cause antibiotic resistance... Hey, girl! I'm sorry, I'm running late! Mariel! Wait up! Give me two minutes, just that! I'm running late! I know, but I won't delay you. Two minutes. - Girl! - Okay. Let's stop arguing. The truth is that I... I'm not a golden coin Braulio. To be of everyone's liking I was born like this and this is how I am If they don't like me, whatever! Shut up! Please! - Damn, girl! - You're so ridiculous. Damn, girl! Look. Happy birthday. I didn't give it to you at the party because you were crazy. Will you wear it? It's a gold nugget. You and me are a team, girl. I would never do anything to hurt you. If I expect too much of you, it's because you can do that and more. Together against the world. Right? Right. What? Mom, why didn't you wake me up? They canceled the training session. What do you mean they cancelled it? There's a crazy woman making a fuss. What? She says Braulio did things he shouldn't have. Seriously, I'm sorry. This is not a good time... What's happening with the tournaments? In two weeks, my daughter is going to Tijuana. Seriously, I'm sorry. I apologize. I'll let you know as soon as I can. Who knows? We need to know. - What's happening? - They suspended Braulio. Why? He's been accused of sexual abuse. Mariel! Mariel, are you okay? Approach straight up. Flex. One, two. Look for the angle. No way, it's not fair. If they accuse you of anything, you don't have any rights, you don't even have the benefit of the doubt. That bitch fucked me up! She fucked me up! Girl, don't leave, please. I need help. I don't know what to do or where to go. You know this will always be your home. Thank you. I went to the Olympic Center. They slammed the door in my face and treated me like a leper. I have a close relationship with all the kids. Of course, how could it be different? They live there, and most parents live outside the city. We take care of them, we see them grow, we nurse them when they get hurt or sick. We know them better than anyone. And you know, girl, sports get the best out of you, but also the worst. And if we as coaches ignore that, if we could not accept them as they are, with all that they are... But for them to say that I'm... I have a daughter, for goodness' sake! How can they believe I'm capable of doing such a thing? - Nobody believes that. - Yes, they do. You saw it, Mariel. Precisely on the day that I get Nadia to join the main team, her crazy mother makes a scandal. Why? Because she doesn't want her to leave! Because her husband left her years ago, and if her daughter leaves too, she'd be all alone. It's unfair to fuck someone over like this, to take everything away, just because you can't stand to see her happy. I'm not the kind of person they say I am. I'm not the kind of person they say I am. Girl... Tell me you know that. Braulio, you're the best man I've ever met in my life. Tomorrow I'll go talk to the Federation. She can't ruin the reputation of a man like you just because she doesn't know what she wants. What if you talk to her? You know Braulio better than anyone. Tell her what kind of man he is and all he has done for you. Analia is right. Maybe then she'll realize the damage she's causing. She's a diver because of you. Really? She must have been eight when she saw you for the first time on a TV show and, since then, she never got off the springboard. - So, why are you here? - I came to see how Nadia is. Nadia is angry. Up until recently, it didn't matter how badly she wanted to be an adult or independent or things like that. There was always a moment when she was a child again. But then, one day, my little girl wasn't there anymore. It's just that the moment when she indulged herself in being a child is gone. And instead, something obscure arose. A void. Are you sure that something really happened? I am sure my daughter is not the same. We're going to the Olympics. There's nothing ordinary about that. And Braulio has to teach Nadia and me how to control our minds and bodies. And he's the best in doing so. He's been training the country's best divers for 20 years. But for that, it's necessary to build trust and to be close to the team members and that may be misconstrued. Yes, but there must be limits, and no one has the right to cross them. Braulio doesn't cross them. Don't confuse your fears with the truth. You could ruin her life and maybe that of a man who wants Nadia to develop to her full potential. She's not the only one. There were more complaints. Who else complained? They're from a few years ago. Well, I've been training with Braulio for 15 years and never heard of anything, so that can't be true. Has that man ever done anything to make you feel uncomfortable? - No. - No? Braulio saw me. When all adults were minding their own business, he saw me. Without him, I would be nothing more than... a broken person. I was everything he dreamed of. He's in love with everything we can create. That's why he cares about her. He wouldn't have spoken to her if he didn't think so. Don't take away your daughter's chance of working with someone who really sees her. The Olympic Committee has already started an investigation. If they confirm that everything's okay, I won't get in my daughter's way. But I need to be sure that my daughter is safe. Do you get me? Thanks for stopping by. Your daughter can make it to the Olympics this year. Not many people have that chance at Nadia's age. She can't do it without Braulio. I can't make it without Braulio. Please, think about what you're doing. Come on. One, two, three. Focus, Nadia. You know. More control in take-off and stop. That's enough. That's it. - Come on, once again. - No, Nadia. That's enough. - Again. - One, two, three. Arms. One, two. Stiff. Up. Face. Then in, okay? One, two. - Ready? - Focus, Nadia! - Braulio. - Easy. Nadia! - What are you doing here, Braulio? - Watching. They told me not to go to the pool, - but didn't mention the seats. - Let's work. I'm sorry, Braulio, I swear it wasn't me. I swear. Go to the springboard. You have to believe me. I told her not to come and she didn't listen. I have nothing to say. - Braulio, look at me! - Don't touch me. - Braulio, please. - Let go. It wasn't me! Nadia, get off me! What's with you? Are you crazy? Are you sick? Are you trying to tease me? Get out of here! Go to work! Get out! - Springboard work! Get out! - Braulio, outside. This is my pool, Gerardo. I built this place. I know, my friend. Let's go to my office. Come with me, please. You can't treat me like this! - Come on. - My team needs me! It's not fair that a fucking kid ruins everything! It's not just about my reputation! I'm talking about the upcoming Olympic Games! Mariel, your last Olympics will get fucked up because of that fucking liar! That's not fair! Not fair! Do you like tomato sauce? I can make one with olive oil and salt. My mom makes it in advance, because after the training sessions, I'm starving and I could eat a horse. Would you like tomato sauce or olive oil and salt? I think you'll like the olive oil better. Whatever you like. - Let's go eat in my room, it's better. - Okay. - I hope you like the pasta. - It looks yummy. Come on in. Come on in, sit down. Wow, I didn't know we had already met. You have articles from when I... You were 12. Those... I'm so stupid, I fucked up again. - Easy. - No, I'm so stupid. No, it's my fault. I'll help you. Easy. Everything will be okay. What's wrong? It's fine. No, nothing is okay. What? Everything will be okay. What's happening? Let me help you. It was my fault. What was your fault? - Everything was my fault. - What are you talking about? I wrote some stuff, all bullshit that was not meant to be read by anyone, not even my mom. - What did you write? - It doesn't matter. Tell me what you wrote. I won't tell anybody. Tell me. Things that didn't happen, things I imagined. - It's all my fault... - Nadia, honey! I'm home! Are you okay? Who gave you permission to enter? Don't treat me like that. Mariel, it's late. Yes. - What happened? - Why do you always ruin everything? - Honey, please! - Get out of my room! - Come on, Poncho, don't be mean. - It's not allowed. You know no visits are allowed after 10:00 p.m. I'm not a visitor, I'm family. How long have we known each other? Yes, right? It's been many years, Ms. Mariel. - Come in. - That's all, Poncho. Thank you! It's true. You don't see it, but the last thing you said, "For Mexico!" - What else was I supposed to say? - "We'll thrive and succeed!" - What else was I supposed to say? - No, it's okay. - Imagine... - "To my coaches"? - Sure! - "To Carlos"? Yes, well, I don't know! Let's hear you. "Sir, could you explain to us what makes you a good coach?" - Yes. - The cameras are on. All the world is watching you. Here I go. Mariel... What are you doing here? That's what I'd like to know. I'm going to ruin everything, Carlos. I'm gonna fuck it up and I'll lose the medal again. No, Mariel. What do you mean by "again"? Forget it, I'm too drunk. No, Mariel. What do you mean by that? When did you fuck it up? You never do. - Yes, I do. - No. - No. - Wanna see? - Mariel. - Want to see? Mariel, what will you do? Come, I'll show you how I always fuck it up. - Wanna see? - What are you doing? - It's stronger than me. - What are you doing? Don't worry, Poncho is a bit deaf, he won't hear us. So what? Do you remember Tampico? That doesn't have anything to do with this. Come here! Stop. See? You're too drunk. - I'm not drunk. - What? You have to be careful. Mariel, what are you doing? Let's go, please! Mariel, please, let's go. - Let's go! - No. What happened? What happened is that we're too drunk. Wait up, come here. Don't be a pussy, come here. Fuck! Mariel, let's go. - Mariel, this isn't funny. Let's go! - Okay. Let's go! Come, help me. Yes, let's go! No, Mariel! Are you crazy? This is not right! Are you crazy, Mariel? Like this. Okay. Who's there? You've got to be kidding me! Come. Carlos. Where are you? Here you are. Let's see. Let's see. Here you are. Mariel, what are we going to do with you? - Can you give me something stronger? - Not so close to the games. You already know that. Come in. - They are starting. - Coming. - You can't go like this. - I'm okay. It's about to start. - And the rest? - They didn't dare to come. - Sure? - Sure. I'm sorry. We are about to start. Please, be seated. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. I appreciate the assistance of so many important athletes. I know you've made a great effort to be here, so we'll start this trial to investigate Nadia Alfaro's case. Excuse me, Mr. Vice President, the ones who were going to testify haven't arrived yet. Could we wait for them? Mrs. Rivas, we've been waiting for 40 minutes. If they had wished to come, they would've arrived. The process should be fair for everyone. Mr. Peralta brought all his people to testify. No, excuse me, they are not "his people," they are his colleagues. They are the most respected athletes in this field, and they came here to talk about their experience with their coach. I think your suggestion that they or the Federation commit objectionable acts is inappropriate. I don't suggest anything, I just ask you to be fair. - I don't want to do this. - Let me do the talking. - May I speak? - Of course, say what you need. Nothing what my mom is saying is true. Honey, don't do this. That is not true. She wants us to move back with my grandparents. That's the reason. Honey, don't do this. Mrs. Rivas, you have already spoken. Now is Nadia's turn. Nadia is a minor, and she can't speak for herself. Of course I can speak by myself. Speak. Everything is a lie. Let's go home. All the horrible things she says about Braulio aren't true. Just because my life is better than hers. I want to be here, I want to live here. You are my real family. Mrs. Rivas, clearly, something in your home isn't right. I think you should take care of what's happening inside your family before making accusations outside of it. The Olympic Center is a safe place. It always has been for all athletes. Mr. Peralta is one of the most respected members. And up until now, we never heard anything so as to continue with his suspension. No one has testified, not even your own daughter. Our community is appalled. These are very delicate moments. We are just a few weeks away from the Olympic Games, and we can't risk our team's performance due to an athlete's personal problems. - You can't do this. - Mrs. Rivas, please. - You don't... - Don't do this to me! - Stop it! - Baby, tell them the truth. Let go off me! If you won't listen, I'll talk to my dad. Nadia! Nadia! Nadia! Put this there, kiddo. - You'll drop it and you'll see. - No. Your mom will get angry. You'll drop them! That's missing. - I have extra silverware. - Just put them in the drawer. - Like this? - Yes. Put some here and here. - The doorbell. - Like this. - They are here. - Thank you, my friend. Honestly, thank you very much. Welcome! - Hey, beautiful! - Hi! How are you? There's exquisite food tonight. We're so glad you came. You look so good today! Girl. And on top of it, I love Greek food! Come on! Let's go to Greece, then. Let's go to Greece, right? Yes, let's go. For Mariel's games. She'll win gold. No, honey, I have to work. You always have to work. No, we are going. I'm a simple man, I don't need anything. Girl, I'm a simple man, right? - If you say so. - No, seriously. No, I don't need anything. I just need a reason to wake up in the morning, a job to come back home and rest, and a family that supports me. That's it, that all. In fact, I'd like to thank you, girl, because although you were little, you gave me a great gift. You chose me to be your family, part of your family. And I want to thank you too, darling, because you never lost your faith in me. Thank you. And thank you. - And you too. - My sincere gratitude. Cheers! Thank you all for being my family! Cheers! I got kind of emotional. - Hi. All good? - Hi. Yes MEXICAN SWIMMING FEDERATION - From college or what? - Yes, college. Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards. - Bring the cards. - All right. Come on! You can leave now! Good luck! I'll sit with Braulio now. On the way back, I'll sit with you. - How are you? - Good. - Excited? - Yes, so excited. Your mother in law is after you! Bus driver. No, a cooler one! Three, two, one. Eggs with oil Eggs with oil Eggs with oil And ham How could you? They think engagement rings But I can only think of Olympic rings Welcome to Guadalajara! - We have the afternoon free! - To the pool! Go to the pool. I'll help with your homework. - Okay. - Good. I can't believe it! Let's see this! Terrific, man. - Ask for ice! - We already sent Alan! - Is this a joke? - Nadia, to the second floor? Are you kidding? Go change! How's the water? Let's go, Mariel. The boys told me the last one pays for the beer. This is so cool! I love it! - I want this bed. - Sure. Braulio told me you've been here before. - Yes, we come almost every year. - So cool. I love the hotel. We'll all be downstairs in the pool. Are you coming? I think I'll stay here and rest. I'm not feeling good. But this will be so cool, we'll all be downstairs. How do I look? Very good. Let me know in case you need anything, okay? Okay. - Nadia! - Come here! Look! I didn't finish high school and I'm a success. - Come here! - No, we'll be studying. Don't listen to them. You'll end up like that. I'm coming! Come here! Okay, so, where were we? We placed a bookmark. Here, perfect. Number two. "It is a geometric locus formed by a set of points that are at the same distance from another fixed point, the center." Good evening. Do you have chamomile tea? Could you send a thermos with hot water and lots of tea bags? Thank you. Hello? Hello, Irene. Nadia isn't here. They're all in the pool. Yes, the whole team. I can tell her you called. Yes, it's okay. Yes, I'll let her know. Nadia. Your mom called. I'll call her back later. Calm down and drink some beer. Nadia, it's late. Let's go. We have to wake up early to train. Come on. If you want, we can watch a movie. What's with you, girl? Do you want to steal my job as coach? Cut that! Don't you remember you were just like her at her age? No one buys your goody-two-shoes act. Please, a beer for Sister Mariel! - Here, just one sip. - I always remind you. Drink it! Apologies if I offended you, Mother! Apologies, Mother, if I offended you! Nadia? From Guadalajara, Luis Caballero and Jesus Crespo Ruiz. You roll because you're going face down. Keep it up. - Come on! - Let's go! You can do it! Judges? Execution. Seven point five, seven point five, seven, seven point five. Synchronization. Seven, seven point five, seven, seven. Thank you, judges. Thank you, competitors. Next, we'll begin women's 10m synchronized diving. Approach straight up! Flex! One and a half turn and front layout in position B. Nadia, are you okay? What happened? Not now, Mariel, please. Ready? Ready? Two, three. Two, three. Judges? Execution. Six point five, six point five, eight, eight. Synchronization. Five, six, five point five, five point five. Let's pack, we're leaving now. Let's pack! When you finish, go to my room. I need to talk to you. Okay. Come in, it's open. Come in. Close the door. If you are going to get mad... What? Get mad? You tell me how I should feel. I don't feel good. I couldn't sleep at all. I think I have a fever. I did my best. - I didn't mean to do that. - Of course you did. You told me that you never wanted to work with Nadia. No, I told you I didn't want someone so young, and that these would be my last games. Look how things worked out now. Now, you're going to your last games thanks to Nadia because what you did today was bullshit. You've been doing a shitty job lately. The level of difficulty of the dive prevented you from being disqualified. Look, you're a talented girl. There's no doubt about it, but you don't have guts. You made it through one Olympics. Only one. And what about the rest? You were disqualified for a stupid mistake. And the rest? You didn't even get on the plane, Mariel! You can't handle the pressure! If you want to sabotage yourself, I'm sorry for you, but it's your choice, your decision. But you're ruining a little girl's chance who's just beginning because you're afraid she'll do better than you. That's twisted, Mariel. I didn't mean to! I've been sick several weeks. And why are you sick? Because you're fucking everyone again! That's why. What? You thought I wouldn't know you fucked Carlos the other night? - Carlos was not supposed to... - It wasn't Carlos. It wasn't him! Alicia told me you've got the weird infection again. We all know everything, girl. And with you, it's the same old story once and again. You can't stop fucking, as you can't stop screwing up your life and the lives of those around you. The Federation wants to get rid of you. They say you're too old. But I asked them to give you another chance. I said Nadia and you were the perfect team, that there's nothing better. - Thank you. - And you fucked it up today! - Help me, please! - Please, don't cry. - I swear I can do it. - Don't make a scene! - Forgive me, Braulio! - Calm down, for goodness' sake. Go to the bathroom! - Wash your face and calm down! - Sorry! - I don't want them to see you like this. - Okay. Stupid girl! Stupid girl! Are you okay? Yes! - More at ease now? - Yes. I need to rest a bit more. I swear I won't fuck up anymore. I hope so, girl. Seriously. Yes. Nadia? I'm almost ready! Tell them I won't take long! Okay! Let's go now! - Shall we go? - Yes, I'll be right there. - My friend. - You did it by a whisker. At least we qualified. - Daddy! - Hi, honey! - Welcome. - Thanks. Welcome. - I missed you so much! - Me too. Welcome. Felix. Where's your mommy? I like having our secret. He asked if he could touch me. That had never happened before. I couldn't speak because he was kissing me so hard and when... he started touching my chest. He had never touched me there. I WANT TO SCREAM I would never do anything to hurt you. Easy, Mariel. You're burning up. He was kissing me so hard. Something started between us. No one else needs to know. Why don't you call the doctor, Gerardo? If the fever increases, she has to go to the hospital. He told me he'd teach me how to feel. They say it's not a problem. If she trains at least for two weeks... I know her, Braulio. Damn, Mariel! Fuck! I'd leave everything for you, Mariel. I swear. Flex here. That's right! Long. Push the platform. Very good. Good, Mariel. Come on! Come on, stretch your leg. Push it in. That's right. Hard. That's right. Nadia is not training? Weren't we a team? Nadia has been working this whole time. You're the one who has to catch up. Yes, but we're diving together, and I have to train with her. No, honey, what you need is to do what I tell you to, okay? - Braulio, I can... - No. Who's the coach here? You? Mariel, will you tell us all what to do? Will you coach the team now? That's all I needed! I'm giving you a chance. Don't push my buttons and get to work! No one is giving me a chance. I'm here because I've earned it. Get down! Get down from the platform right now! Get down, Mariel! I'm telling you to get down! All right! You're done. I came to train with my partner. - You're done for today. - We're only weeks away... - Get out of the pool! - ...from the Olympics! Get out right now or you'll be expelled! What do you say? Right now! Get out! And don't think of coming here if you're not willing to follow my fucking orders! Would you like to eat anything? Gerardo took your siblings to a game. - Are you okay, Yeya? - Not now, Mom. What's going on, honey? Please, I want to be alone. What's going on, Mariel? I don't want to talk right now. We have to talk. I won't let you do what you always do. What I always do? What the fuck are you talking about? You're sabotaging yourself. The Olympic Games are near, and you've become self-destructive. Where did you get that shit from? Braulio called this afternoon and said you were out of control. Leave before anything happens. I'm not going anywhere until you explain to me why you're destroying everything you've built. - Stop it, for fuck's sake! - Don't talk to me like that! You want to know what's happening? All right! The great mystery is that you were there, right? Every year, in every fucking tournament, you were there. Or he was here, because he's family, because we're a fucking happy family. How could you not know, Mom? "Easy, girl, you rock here." "If you make a good dive, "I'll make you feel real good." "I'll teach you how to be my woman." What's wrong with you? "You taste so good, girl." You're messed up. "You'll never find someone like me." How can you say something so appalling? - "I can't live without you, girl." - You're so sick! Didn't you want to know what was going on? That's what happened, right under your fucking nose, the whole time. Why did you let me go to Monterrey? You were supposed to take care of me. Mom! You scared me to death! Sorry. - Nadia was worried too. - Why? "Why?" You're a team, right? Are you ready to do team work or are we still having issues? No issues. Stop, Braulio, let me go! I'll see you in 20 at the pool. Everybody to the pool! Remember, arms, with strength! Approach straight up. Jump! Like that! Again! Again! Nadia, your face! That's right! Please, focus! You're not in sync, please! Push the platform. Rib tuck. Look for the water and flex. - Who told you to stop? - Nadia is tired. Did I tell you to stop? Come on! We can't be doing this all day! Watch out! You were ahead. If you want to chat, go to a café! Arms! With strength! Again! You count. One, two. - Damn! That's worth the gold! - Come on, team! Motherfucker! Excellent, I see gold now! Did you pack already? I already packed mine. My dad says that's ridiculous, because me and my mom pack two days before the trip so we don't forget anything. Do you think it'll be cold? - I searched on the Internet... - I know about Braulio. I don't know what you mean. The same happened to me. Nadia. Nadia, please, let me help you. I don't need your help. What he's doing is wrong. He's our coach. He's an adult. And you're a little girl. I'm not a little girl. You're 14, I was your same age. But I was all alone, and you are not. - You don't get what happens between us. - I perfectly get it. He's telling you that you rock, that you're special and there's no one like you, that you must keep the secret because they won't get it. I perfectly know what he's telling you. Braulio was right. He said you'd try to screw everything up. You're so damn jealous! I don't care! Back from Greece, we'll get married and he'll be with me. He's leaving his wife. What happened? You have to take a shower. Today's the press conference. Braulio came to see you. He's downstairs. He wants to talk to you. He called last night. I think you need to apologize to him, Mariel. We're so close, honey. - If you came to threaten me... - No, Mariel. I came to apologize. Forgive me. Forgive me, please. I was so confused. And now I realize that I've become a monster. I am a human being with flaws and weaknesses, but I don't want that to justify all the damage I've done, especially to you, girl. Forgive me, please. You're Mariel. My Mariel. We had a very special relationship, girl. And I miss it. I miss it so much. I need you. And I know you need me too. You and I are meant for each other. Please. Let's give ourselves another chance. We have to be together. Don't you ever touch me again... in your fucking life. Don't ever touch me again. Do you want your medal? Don't you dare touch her. If you get close to her again, I'll tell everything to everyone. I don't give a fuck if my life goes down with yours. I mean it. We want to honor these athletes who are traveling to Greece tomorrow to represent Mexico in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. A round of applause, please! Bravo! We're very proud to represent our country. - My pleasure. - Good luck, Mariel. All right, kids, it's time! Let's go! I'm so proud of you, honey. Let's go, kids! Mexico! Irene. Forgive me. From Greece, Eftihia Pappa and Florentia Sfakianou. From Mexico, Mariel Saenz and Nadia Alfaro. Mariel has achieved the best performance in her whole career. We'll see the Mexican duet. A brilliant duet formed by expertise and youth. They'll perform the last dive. A dive with a great level of difficulty. They already dominate this technique, despite the short time they've been training together. It's the last dive of the competition. All Mexico's watching what could be the first medal for the Mexican Olympic Team. I WANT TO SCREAM I'd have liked to do something before, but I couldn't. What? How? This can't be true! This is really extraordinary! It doesn't seem to be an injury, but something must have happened because Mexico is leaving without its medal. Braulio Peralta told me he'd never met anyone like me, something that surely he also told your daughter. If it hadn't been for Nadia, I might never have woken up from this nightmare. The only thing I can give her is the truth, and hope she can run away before this hell consumes her alive. Subtitle translation by Mariana G. Benítez
