foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Okay. Mm. Oh my God. Wow. The earth just moved. I told you, baby. I told you. No. Maybe it was an earthquake. Well, who cares? It's over now. Max! What the hell? Karen, baby, I, uh- Don't Karen me. But I thought you weren't comin' home till tomorrow morning. I caught an earlier flight. That's terrific. Air travel's such a drag these days. Rita, what are you doing in bed with my husband? He said he was sad, that you'd been killed in a freak skateboarding accident. It was the least I could do. Get out. You got it. Not you, her. Oh, okay. A skateboarding accident? Okay. I could've been a little more original. Oh my god. Why me? Why is it always me? Oh. I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Oh, sorry? Sorry I came home early is the only thing you're sorry about. Look, I'm under a tremendous amount of pressure at work. You know that. This satellite project is gonna cost someone their job. And I don't know, I just had a lot of built up pressure I needed to relieve before I exploded. So you explode on Rita? She was just there. She doesn't mean anything. It's you that I love. Hmph. Don't make me vomit. I said I was sorry. Okay, and that's supposed to make it all right? Well, you know what? It doesn't, not hardly. Well, what do you want me to do? Hmm, leave me alone for a while, and then you can take your sorry ass onto the couch. Think you can do that? Got it. Welcome to my world. Just fabulous. Son of a bitch. Oh. Take a shower? Yes. It helped me to think. I've come to a decision. You don't wanna get a divorce, do you? Not at all. I was thinking I should've been there for you. If I wasn't on the road working all the time, I could've been here to help relieve your stress better. What? It's my fault. I've been a very bad, bad wife, but I can fix that. Okay, wait. I'm not understanding this at all. You are the one who's designing the Orion Deep Space Satellite, yes? Well, yeah, but you already know that. You have a brilliant mind. I should be doing whatever I can to help you achieve your goals. You need to complete the satellite without delay. I'm glad you're feeling better, but I mean, I'm still really sorry about what happened. Shh. Let's not discuss that. It's finished, done. Just let me do what a wife does for her hardworking husband. You don't mean... Oh yeah, you do mean. Mm-hmm. I've been looking into everyone's progress with a close and watchful eye. And, frankly, I am not happy with what I'm seeing, not happy at all. This kind of experimentation doesn't fall off a tree like an autumn leaf, Mr. Roberts. It takes time. Failure is a part of success. Well said, Carla. But it's the progress or lack of progress that concerns me. That especially goes for your work, Tom. I'm moving forward as quickly as I can. It's a big universe. Yes, and I want to see every inch of it. Sorry I'm late. Rough night? Eventful. Did I miss anything? Not really, we were just discussing the lack of productivity in the current design flow. I see. So where are we at with that? I was just telling Tom and Carla that we need to have some advancement on their end, or we're all going to be in trouble. I agree. Anything I can do? Oh goodness, no. Your progress has been superior. You're right on schedule. You keep with what you're doing. If only these two could keep up with you, then we'd be two steps ahead of the competition. That's not really fair. You can't compare what I do to Max's work. They're completely different. Same here, Max's designs have not even been checked out for feasibility. How do we know his satellite plans are even gonna work? Enough. I've let you know how I feel. Now take that information and do something constructive with it. Good day. How come everything you touch turns the gold? Search me. And let me tell you, last night, I really dodged a bullet. How's that? I'll tell you later. Right now, I'm gonna step out and grab a cup of coffee. I'm just a bit worn out. What are we going to do? It's time to take action, subversive action. You've got a plan? A cunning plan, but the less you know, the better. I'll let you in on it when the time is right. You got it, Tiger. Max. How'd you know it was me? Call it women's intuition. Hey, well, I just wanted to check in with you and just let you know how much I loved you. Is everything okay at work? Sure. Everyone's gettin' their asses handed to them, every everyone but me. Hmm. That's because you're the best at what you do. Hey, I was thinkin', maybe we should invite Tom and Carla over tonight for cocktails. They're both takin' a real beating here, and I don't know, I'm feelin' kind of guilty. That's a great idea, darling. There's something I've been meaning to give to Carla anyways, and that would be the perfect opportunity. Great, you're a doll. So I'll ask 'em. Max. Yeah? Hurry home. Kisses. Now where does Max keep those plans for the new satellite? I gotta get a jump on him, or he's gonna eat my job for breakfast. Where would I hide the blueprint if it was me? Tom? Hey, Max. Hey, I was just looking for you. I told you I was stepping out to get a cup of coffee. I know. I didn't mind waiting. What can I do for you? Frankly, Max, I'm a little worried about my job. I know what you mean. Old man Roberts can be a tad bit blunt at times, but I don't think it's anything to worry about. He's just blowin' hot air. Do you think so? He was makin' it sound like if I didn't get the results he wanted, and soon, I'd be hangin' my hat somewhere else. Oh, I don't think he meant it like that. I do, and Carla does too. I just can't afford to start job hunting right now. Forget it. He's just trying to motivate you. You think so? I do. Hey, and while you're here, how about you and Carla come over to the house tonight for cocktails? Tonight? Yeah, sure. Why not? Is Karen back in town? Came back last night. Ah, I bet you had some catchin' up to do, huh? Yeah. So, uh 7:30? You got it. I'll tell Carla. Maybe I oughta take these home with me tonight just to be safe. You still don't have the plans for the new satellite? Not yet, but I'm close. I'll have 'em soon. You do understand, time is of the essence. I understand a hundred percent. You can count on me. I have. So far, we've seen no results. Funny, my boss was just sayin' the same thing. But don't worry, I know what I'm doing. I hope so. We've advanced you considerable cash for those plans, and so far we have nothing to show for it. Like I said, you have nothin' to worry about. Why, I'd bet my life, I'll have those plans for you by the end of the week. You just did. Now go. I'll let you know what happens. I have to say, I was really surprised you called me this morning. I can't stay mad at you, Rita. Besides, it was just a big misunderstanding. Well, I'm certainly relieved that you're not really dead. I don't know where Max came up with that. I'm just happy you were there to comfort him. What are neighbors for? What indeed. That's a really nice piece. Where did you get it? Do you like it? Mm-hmm, there's something about it, but I can't quite put my finger on it. It's made from a meteorite. It's the latest fashion in New York. Do you want one? I probably couldn't afford somethin' like that. Nonsense. I liked it so much that I bought extras for my friends. Really? Yeah. Let's try this on you. Karen, I don't know what to say. You're outta this world. Well, I think you just said it. There. Better? Much better. I'd like to show you something I learned last night. Can't remember the last time I was here. What, two, three weeks ago maybe? So you've been a busy one, Karen. Yes, traveling all around the country here and there. Sometimes I feel like a stranger in my own house. It's good to come home to someone like Max. He certainly is full of surprises. Karen's been promoted to head buyer of her company. Oh, so you'll be gone even more. I hope not. I don't like leaving Max unattended for too long. He doesn't do well when I'm away. Every man needs a good woman behind him. Or under him, for that matter. Well, now that you're back, maybe Max can settle down and finish up his work on the new Orion Deep Space Satellite. I totally agree. All that deep space business is really taking up a lot of his time. He barely has any time for me anymore. You can't spread yourself too thin, Max. Um, honey, could I speak with you in the kitchen for a moment? Certainly. Excuse us. Hmm. That's odd. Karen, I don't know how to say this to you gently, but we can't be talkin' about the satellite plans in front of Tom and Carla. Why? They both work with you. I didn't know you had any secrets. It's not like that. It's very competitive among researchers, and Tom would like nothin' more than to trip me up. Seriously? Seriously. I have to beat them to the finish line. I didn't know this was a race. Well, you like this house. You like that shiny car outside. All this depends on me being better than Tom and Carla. Heads are about to roll at work right now, and I wanna be the one holdin' the ax, understand? I think so. Can I see your designs? What? I'm interested in what you do. You are my husband. I'd like to see your work. Honey, I would, but I don't think you'd understand 'em, even if I showed 'em to you. Try me. I am your wife. Okay, well, maybe later. Right now we have guests, remember? Oh, of course. Shall we? We've gotta find Max's blueprints if we wanna save our jobs. I know, but how do we do that? He is so secretive about them. I know they're in this house somewhere. They have to be. I checked his office, nothing. You wanna ransack his house? Of course not. We've gotta do this in a way where no one will ever suspect. I'll excuse myself and check his home office out. That's the most likely place. What do I do? You check the other rooms. Say you gotta powder your nose or somethin'. That always works. Powder my nose? Got it. That's my girl. Sorry about that. I suddenly developed one hell of a headache. Are you okay? Sure. Karen showed me where the as aspirin were. Actually, I'm feelin' much better already. Do you mind if I use your phone? I just remembered an important call I gotta make. Of course. There's one in Max's office. Thanks. I know where it is. Ooh, that's very pretty. Is it new? Yes. You like it? And how? Yes? It's Tom. Tom, what news have you got for me? I got the blueprints. Excellent work. When can we expect you? Soon, very soon. But I've been thinking. You're not payin' me enough. Really? Yeah, really. I want more, a lot more. This is worth it. I don't like being double-crossed, Tom. You're playing with fire here. Now, I suggest you bring me those plans, and we'll forget about this whole incident. You heard me. I want double, in cash. All right. You win. I'll have the money tomorrow, noon. Good. No tricks. No tricks. Find What you're looking for? Karen, yeah, yeah. Everything's fine. I just owed somebody a return call. Kind of slipped my mind earlier. How much do you know about Max's work? Me? Almost nothing. We kinda keep our projects to ourselves. You know, it's like, not a big topic at the water cooler. Hmm. That's too bad, because I would really reward the man that could explain what my husband's going through. Reward? I don't think I get your drift. Hmm. Okay, I get that one. Actually, I do know a couple things about him. He's, he's a good guy. So you understand. It's just him reinforcing company policies. I don't think there's anything meant by it. It's just a smoke screen. Well, I certainly hope so. I wonder what's taking Tom so long. Oh, don't worry about him. I'm sure Karen'll round him up. Mm. Can I use your powder room? Sure. I'll show you. Here you go. Thanks, Max. You have a lovely house. Why, thank you. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Looking for something? Oh, Karen, you gave me quite a start. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spook you. I lost an earring. I thought it might be here somewhere. Please, I know what you're looking for. You do? You think I don't know? Know what? I have a pretty good idea of what you're up to. I don't blame you. That's pretty big of you, Karen. You are, after all, only human. Thanks for understanding. You can't help yourself. So would you like to see it? Yes, I would. Good. Admit it. You're admiring my necklace. What? Oh, I mean, yes. That's an amazing piece. It's made of meteorite. Wow. No. I have an extra one I'd like to give to you. Really? Hmm. Better? Yes. Better. Good, I want you to meet me here tomorrow at 1100 Earth hours. I understand. Good. Mm. Mm-hmm. What is it? I had the plans right in my hand, and Karen walked in on me. She took them. How terrible. You bet it is. Did you see her? Yes, I did. Did you see where she put the blueprints? Blueprints? No. All right, we gotta get outta here. Are you ready? Sure. Scotch and soda. No thanks, Max. Uh, I think Carla has caught your headache. I better take her home. Oh? Okay. Well, I hope you get to feelin' better. Goodnight, Max. What got into them? I don't know. Hmm. Good morning, Max. Morning, Mr. Roberts. How's that project coming along? Great, I should have somethin' to show you by the end of the day. That's what I want to hear. This company rolls on results, boy, not, uh, speculation. With all due respect, sir, I think you were a bit harsh yesterday on Tom and Carla. I know they're both workin' really hard. I was trying to light a fire under them. I need their best work out of them, and frankly, I'm not getting it. Do you know both of them are late this morning? I haven't seen hide nor hair of them. Well, I know Tom's been under a lot of stress lately. Hmph, yes, gambling debt, so I'm told, not that it matters to me as long as it doesn't affect his work. Well, I'm sure you'll see some positive results soon. Well, I'd better, otherwise there's going to be some serious house-cleaning around here. Well, I'll see you later. See you around four? Now, I know I put those blueprints in here and took them home with me last night. Oh, where could they be? Did I leave 'em at home? Damn it. As we've all learned, in the future, most of our universe will be destroyed by an intergalactic war. This war was brought on in part by the discovery of our planet by the Orion Deep Space Satellite, a satellite created by the man I'm married to. This cannot happen. We have the plans now. This terrible tragedy can be avoided. Our way of life will go on without war, without destruction. We have the plans, and that will stop the development of the satellite for now. But what of the future? Max will continue his development, and who knows how long it will be before he achieves success? What's the answer? We must kill Max. That's the only way to protect our world. Unfortunate but true. He cannot be left to continue his work on the satellite. Is it really necessary to kill him? Is there no other way? No. He must die. What if we take him with us? That would stop the development of the satellite without any bloodshed. Excellent idea. But can we get away with it? I believe it's possible. Tricky, but we could do it. Then all we have to do is wait for him to come home. Agreed, and in the meantime, let's show Carla what we've learned about the human form while we've been on the planet. You mean? Yes, with the human body, we can experience the sensation of touching each other. It's very enlightening. Show me. Tom! Carla. I'll have to say I'm surprised. Pleasantly so, but surprised nonetheless. What's with the gun? Well, I hate to break up the party, but I need Max's plans. And you want them badly enough to do this? I'm not proud of myself, but it's become a matter of life or death, my life. I'm so disappointed in you. Save it, Carla, okay. You have no idea what I'm up against. I'm swimming in debt. I've made bad deals with some very bad people. Those plans are my ticket outta here. Well, this will definitely cost you your vacation days. Who cares? I quit. Would you reconsider if we were nice to you? Not a chance, sister. Besides, Max is a smart guy. He'll have this up and running again soon. It may take a little longer than expected. Is this goodbye? Ciao, baby. Well, that could have gone better. Hello? Max, the most amazing thing just happened. Karen, listen. I've been trying to reach you. I think I left some work at home. I need you to go see if you can find it. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Your friend Tom broke into the house, pulled a gun on me, and stole your blueprints. What? You heard me. He just took the plans and ran off. If you have any idea where he's going, you should find him. I think he's planning on selling these to some bad guys. That's son of a bitch. We can't let him get away with this. No, we can't. Now go get 'em. Thanks. I'll let you know what happens. Damn it. Anybody here? I'm here. Good. I wouldn't want you standing me up. We kept our promise. I hope I can say the same for you. Do you have the plans? Right here. And I can't tell you how difficult it was to get my hands on these. You got the money? It's all here. As we agreed? Double? Double. You don't mind if I count it, do you? Oh, be my guest. What's the matter? You don't like 'em? These are the plans for an outdoor patio barbecue deck. Apparently somebody's planning on doing a little remodeling. What? I stole these satellite plans. I took them from Max's wife, at gunpoint. I threatened to kill them all. I'm glad to hear you say that. Huh? FBI. You're under arrest. Damn it. There is one more sensation you must experience before we leave this world and return to our natural form. What is it? Sex with a man. But there's no one here but us. Let me show you what I've learned since I've been here. This may be our only chance. Is it the same as with the female of the species? It's very different, but it's better if I show you. Karen. Thank God. Yes? Mr. Roberts, I found my plans. I didn't know they were lost. I think someone's trying to play a wicked game with me. But either way, I have them, and I'll bring them over to you later today. Well, that's excellent news, and believe me, I could use some right now. Why? What happened? Haven't you heard? Heard what? It was Tom. The FBI just called. He's been arrested for international espionage. What? I don't believe it. It's true. Apparently, he'd been dealing with a foreign power and was going to steal your plans and sell them on the black market. That's what Karen said. It's true. The only trouble was he was dealing with an undercover federal agent. They caught him red-handed. Wow, thank God he didn't get the plans. Thank God for that. What about Carla? She's not involved as far as we know. We still haven't been able to locate her. Well, I'm sure she'll turn up soon. Let's hope so. I'm looking forward to seeing you later. Well, I see you finally made it. Rita? What are you doing here? Haven't you heard? We all made out. I mean made up. You and Karen made up? Yes. She's waiting for you. Where is she? In the bedroom. Thanks. What the hell's goin' on here? Well, hello, darling. I guess this is a bit awkward. This can't be happenin'. Well, what if I don't wanna go? You don't have a choice. Oh, what a rush. I think I'll stay on this planet a little bit longer. There's lots of new experiences to be had, and besides, the sex is outta this world. Hmph. Don't make me vomit. A skateboarding accident? Okay, I could've been a little more original. You check the other rooms. Say you gotta powder your nose or somethin'. That always works. But there's no one here but us. Haven't you heard? We all made out. I mean made up. It was Tom. The FBI just called. He's been arrested for international espionage. These are the plans for an outdoor patio barbecue deck.
