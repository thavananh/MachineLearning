But this jungle was the bloodiest corner on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. They called it "The Iron Triangle." Headquarters suspected a heavy enemy buildup in this sector. I had to take a company in to recon the area. I spoke Vietnamese, so I guess they thought I could communicate with the people. They were wrong. MAN ON RADIO: California 1 Bravo, this is California 1 Alpha. Not a damn thing down there. Just a couple of hooches burning. Repeat, no sign of hostiles. You want me to lay some shit down there? Negative. Maybe civilians in there. We can handle it. Might just keep our asses covered anyway. Over. Stay close, Rivers. [SOLDIERS CHUCKLING] Hey, keep the chatter down. SOLDIER: Yes, sir. Hey, watch out... Yes, sir. [WHISPERING] Hey, Grover, hey. That's bungee heaven out there. Yes, sir. Shit, man. That shit's gonna rot your teeth out, Swan. We do search-and-find, there won't be much left of that village when we get through. That's fine with me. SWAN: I thought we was gonna get some airpower. KEENE: Murphy! Murphy! Murphy! SOLDIER: Roger, California 1 Alpha. [HELICOPTER APPROACHING] Yes, sir. Looks a little hostile in there. Maybe we ought to send some airpower, soften it up a bit. You in command here, Murphy? [SIGHS] No, sir. Send a squad around the west flank of the hamlet. KEENE: When I first got to Nam, I used to worry about getting all of my men home alive. After a while, I started to worry if I'd get any of them back. [MACHINE GUN FIRE] [SOLDIERS SCREAMING] [GROANING] [SCREAMING] What are you screaming about, asshole? [CRYING] My foot! My foot! Hey, hey, motherfucker, you goin' home! [BOTH LAUGHING] Damn! Move out! [BABY CRYING] [GUNFIRE] Hold your fuckin' fire! Swan! Come back here, asshole! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] Hold your fire! We got a man in there! Hold your fuckin' fire! Stop! God damn it! Shit! Swan! Swanny! Swanny! Come on out, man! Swanny! [BABY CRYING] Hi. You little pile of shit. You ever do that again, I'll shove this Thompson up your ass! [CHUCKLING] Why don't you make yourself useful and find the kid's mother, Sergeant Murphy? SOLDIER: Keep your eyes open. [BABY CRYING] Ready? Hit it! All clear. Sir, we got two wounded. Fuck. I called for a dust-off. Mark the LZ with a yellow smoke. Get 'em ready for the medevac. Right. KEENE: Check those hooches! Scottie, here. Pick it up. Get out of there, you asshole. Move it. Over here! Take care of that slope bastard. Good job, Sergeant. Let's get this area secured. Get your men checking for bunkers. Find something to blindfold him. MURPHY: You know Vietnamese, sir? KEENE: Yeah. What's it say? Says we're their friends. Shit. Take a squad into those hills up there. Make sure we got no charles hanging around. Yes, sir. Friends. Why the fuck do I got to be on point? If I gotta be here, Swan, you gotta be here. Especially after that stunt you pulled. SWAN: Point. There's a bunch of swinging dicks out there just waiting to punch our clocks, you know? Here's your body bag, boys and girls. [TWIG SNAPS] You're a funny guy sometimes, you know? But you're still a dick brain. MURPHY: Yeah, man. A million laughs. That's what I'm doing... Killing slime with jokes. I don't know how we'd see 'em around here. MURPHY: Damn, Swan, you complaining? I'll send out invitations for them to join us. And we'll all go play cowboys and Indians. Hey, where the fuck are we anyway, man? Maybe we should slow down and wait for the others. No, we okay. We okay. I don't like this, man. Be cool, be cool. [GUNSHOT] Murphy! Murphy! Cocksucker! Murphy, man. Murphy. Hey, chickenshit! Hey, dick... [GASPING] Fuck you. Fuck you. [COUGHING] [GASPS] KEENE: His name was Ho. I learned that later when I found his blood-stained diary. A lot of VC soldiers kept diaries. We couldn't have been more different. Maybe we couldn't have been more alike. But soon this crazy war would bring us together. This is our story. Good hunting, Ho? Yes. I never saw a gun like this before. It's beautiful. It's a fine weapon. I'll take it. I can make good use of it. So can I! I'm a Workers' Party official. That doesn't make you a better soldier. Take one of the others. I want this one! [BOTH GRUNTING] Captain Tuong can decide this. Well, let him. [VIETNAMESE FOLK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] TUONG: Sit down, Khoi. KHOI: Thank you, Comrade Captain. You, too, Ho. You killed an American? Two. Excellent. If I may say so, Comrade Captain, it is not excellence at question here. What then? I am a party official. I can make good use of this weapon. Ho regards it as his personal trophy and refuses to give it to me. I admire your zeal, Comrade Khoi. But, in this case, I believe it mistaken. From each, according to his ability, to each according to his need. Comrade Ho's needs are greater. You are busy with party duties while he faces combat. You doubt my courage, Comrade Captain? No. Neither do I doubt Comrade Ho's revolutionary morality. The gun is his. Take one of the others. Very well. When I have the opportunity, I will appeal your decision to party officials in the north. You want to report me? Go ahead, Comrade Khoi! But... You are a long way from your opportunity. So you believe I doubt your courage? I merely asked, Comrade Captain. In answer, I'm going to give you a mission to perform with Comrade Ho. Do you object? No, Comrade Captain. TUONG: There is a certain official. His name is Chau. You will recognize him when you see him because he's fat. [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] CHAU: What has happened? What is happening? Answer me! What has happened? Answer me! [BABY CRYING] [STUTTERING] Can I be of service to you, comrade? There's a traitor on the bus. CHAU: Comrade! You are mistaken. I am not a traitor! Comrade! [SOBBING] Please, please, please. I beg you! Please! Please. [SOBBING] You are a Christian? Yes.Would you like to pray? KHOI: Would you like to pray? Yes. Then pray. Our Father who art in Heaven... [CHAU GRUNTS] It would have hurt nothing if you had let him finish his prayer! It would have helped nothing. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] KEENE: We'd returned to base with our prisoners so that Army Intelligence could interrogate them. [SOLDIERS CHEERING] [SOLDIERS WHISTLING] KEENE: There are some sights in a war that you'll always remember. A beautiful woman is one of them. She dealt in propaganda... And got a lot of people killed. Hey, right here! Her bodyguard was a Frenchman. There are some sights you never get used to. [PANTING] Sir! Captain Keene, sir! [GASPING] He's dunking the poor bastard! [GUNSHOT] That's one crazy son of a bitch! KEENE: Captain Duc! What the hell's going on here? Interrogation, Captain. You kill this man? These are my prisoners, and they're going to be evacuated to the rear! Is that clear? This is South Vietnam, and these are my prisoners! I take charge of them! Like motherfucking hell you will! He'll blow your ass to kitty litter if you want to start some shit! Now, back off and deliver those men! Take them. That was for me. That way my men respect me. Captain! First you better grow a pair of balls, then hit the bush and find your own prisoners. Joop! Sir! Take charge. Yes, sir! You heard the Captain! Now, back off, my friend! I'm taking charge! [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] [SOLDIERS CHATTERING] Jacques Potier. At your service, Captain. What's your authorization here? Just passing through. You... You with that woman? JACQUES: Yeah, I'm with that woman. She's part of the program to educate the peasants about the evils of collaboration with the enemy. You buy that shit? [SPEAKING FRENCH] Huh? I'm only here to protect her, that's all. French army, huh? Foreign Legion. Why'd you come back to Nam? May I? Go ahead. The last time, I was... I was here at Dien Bien Phu. That was a hell of a battle. Yeah. 1,500 of us. A few of us survived. Heroic. And, uh, dumb. Just like you. Back there with Captain Duc. So don't waste your courage on men like that. Save it for the VC. Let them kill each other off. I'm here to keep my men alive till we get the hell out. That's it. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Right, Captain? [CHUCKLING] What the hell's that supposed to mean? All is lost, except honor. Nothing's lost, pal. This ain't Dien Bien Phu. We're talking Stars and Stripes. Asshole. We move out at dawn. Move out? Helicopters have been passing by all day. We're heading west to Metang Village. What's Tuong afraid of? It's time we stand and fight! [BOTH LAUGHING] Don't know why he hates me. He hates everybody. But why me? Why not you? PHAM: You're young. You went to school. Yeah, but if he knew you like I do, he wouldn't be jealous. Is that gum in your mouth, or are you chewing your tongue, Ho? You're a bad example of a good little boy. Don't you know you have to share with your comrades? [LAUGHING] All right, all right! All right! You forget how well I treat you. How can I with all your reminders? What do I do about Khoi? All he wants to do is kill Americans. The problem is he sees how Tuong ignores him in your favor. Pham, I don't look for that. You don't have to. It just is. Hey, there's a meeting tonight with entertainment. Come on. Try to have a good time for a change. Just look out for Khoi during the session. He'll try to criticize you to the others and make you look bad. I don't have anything to worry about. Yeah. Nothing but that ugly face. [LAUGHING] Oh, yeah? [DRAMATIC FOLK MUSIC PLAYING] Comrades! I have finally found a solution to the American problem! All we have to do is tell the Chinese that Americans are good to eat and invite them to dinner! [ALL LAUGHING] KHOI: The Americans smell so bad that even the Chinese would refuse! [ALL LAUGHING] My fellow bo doi, I'm happy to see you enjoying yourselves tonight, as our General Giap would like to see, especially in such difficult times as these. But our burdens continue as long as the Americans walk our land. The Sisters Trung drove out the Chinese many years ago and died with honor as we must be prepared to do. For our nation, we must forget self. Comrade Ho understands that well. Isn't that true, Comrade Ho? Yes, Comrade Khoi. We all must share the burden as soldiers of a just cause as we have been doing and shall continue to do so. And yet your dedication seems to be for self-advancement, seeking to impress our leader, Captain Tuong, at every opportunity. Is that not true? I am a simple follower, Comrade. I'm here to obey and to die if need be. Nothing more. You misjudge my need for service with false pride. My only reward would be a final victory for all of us here. KHOI: Reward? Just as our captain rewards you while the deeds of others go ignored? You are wrong, Comrade Khoi. Courage and dedication are never overlooked. You place your anger wrongly. I speak freely for myself and for all of us. And I say this for all to hear! That I was witness to your great deed just today. And for this, Captain Tuong, the state believed in you and always will! Enough of that, Ho! Your bravery will set example for all of us to follow. [MEN CHANTING] Khoi, Khoi, Khoi, Khoi, Khoi, Khoi, Khoi, Khoi, Khoi, Khoi. [CHANTING CONTINUES] [CLANGING] There'll be no fighting tonight. Why? It's a clear night with a full moon. [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] I wish the rains would come. When I lived in Saigon, I always thought only farmers prayed for rain. Well, city boy, now you know. Plants need rain to grow. We need it to hide us from our enemies. Pham... Some of the others say that once you kill your first man, you get used to it. I can't. Can you? I don't think about the killing much anymore, not since I lost my family. All I ever wanted was to be a farmer like my father. Now all I have left is revenge. My father showed me the beauty of life. I'm still finding it hard to forget those lessons, Pham. You have to. You're a soldier now. Don't you fight for revenge, too? Maybe I do. I don't know. It's too easy, Pham. We lived in Saigon. My father was a teacher. He was sent into the delta one day to teach at a school there. When we arrived, there were government soldiers. He didn't have his papers. They thought he was Viet Cong. They killed him. I don't know if what I feel is revenge, but whatever it is it's eating away my soul, comrade. Sometimes I don't think I can stand it any longer. Maybe not. But you have no choice except to continue the fight. Is that all there is, Pham? For now, yes. KEENE: This is the sector we're going to probe. Recon reports movement, especially around this hamlet called Metang. Made a pass through there about five clicks. Chopped up the ground pretty good and flushed out about a dozen VC. I think there's some kind of buildup near there. You see any ordinance being transported? Nothing. Took some ground fire and disengaged. Dropped down low enough so my ass is dragging in the dirt. [SOLDIERS LAUGHING] I'll be moving in with a dozen men at first light. We'll break squelch every two hours. They'll all be under the command of Lieutenant Gambrel. That goes for you, too, Captain Duc. My superiors would never permit that, Captain. Oh. Then you can take rear security. Rear is what you're good at, isn't it, Captain? Excuse me, Lieutenant. GAMBREL: Certainly, Captain. Excuse me. [CHUCKLES] Gentlemen, the objective is Metang. KEENE: I didn't know it at the time, but the enemy was also setting their sights on Metang. It was about to become the staging area for a massive offensive. Soon I would meet Ho. Come here, Ho. There is the village Metang. A friend waits there to tell us what we need to know. Pham is with them. You go with me. Yes, Comrade Captain. How goes it? Not well. They come from Saigon to denounce my fighting brothers and spew lies among the people, telling them they are free. [VEHICLE APPROACHING] Her name is Khan Ly. She stays at the old French house. The government sees how hard you work on the land. Therefore, I urge your cooperation for the guarantee that the land be distributed fairly among all of you. Don't be deceived or intimidated by these bandits that call themselves the freedom fighters. After 10 years, you will own the land, legally. The survey of the land will take place soon after that. And then the distribution will begin. That's all we ever hear from the government. We drove the French out and still we don't have the land. When are we going to be able to feed our children? What is your name? Szan Tui. Well, Szan Tui, I'm glad that you have the courage to speak up. That is important in a democracy like ours. SZAN TUI: The Viet Cong come here and give us the land. They say it belongs to us and always will. They say you come here with more tricks to keep us fooled. And where is the paper giving you the title? Be patient. Our success depends on that. Our government operates by the will of the people. KEENE: We were getting closer to Metang. But we hadn't found jack shit. That's how it was with the VC. They could be right in front of you and you couldn't see them. Is the whore going to die? The woman? An enemy is an enemy! SHEN: I hope you enjoy our humble meal. HO: This is a feast for us. PHAM: It sure is. SHEN: Times are hard. Rice beer for our friends. PHAM: This is excellent, Comrade Shen. Isn't it, Ho? Ho! Ho! [CHUCKLES] I never tried it before. PHAM: Here's your chance. My friend's a city boy. Serve it. Serve it. Go, go, go! Tonight will be a long night, Ho. We can have one drink. WOMAN: Ho, what's wrong? HO: I've been ordered to kill a woman. It troubles me. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Is that the house? SHEN: That is where she'll be with her Frenchman. I'll meet you on the ridge by the river. [THUDDING] [GRUNTS] [BOTH LAUGHING] [BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH] [WATER RUNNING] [GUN CLICKS] [EXCLAIMS IN FRENCH] [SCREAMING] [BOTH GROANING] [GROANING] [SCREAMING] [GASPS] [GUN COCKING] Please. Please. [GASPS] [GROANING] She's dead? What's wrong? Nothing. Go back to Captain Tuong and report. We are warriors of the National Liberation Front. Today we come to Metang as friends and comrades. At my feet here, you see the fruit of revolutionary justice and the fate of those who betray the people. KEENE: Joop! JOOP: Yes, sir? Take point. Yes, sir. [GUNFIRE] Get down! Stay down! This is Iron One Bravo. Ambush! We're in deep shit! Take cover! We're in ambush. We need support. I repeat... Spread out! [GROANS] American officer. Well done, Ho. KEENE: A lot of brave men died to find out that the enemy buildup was real. A lot of good that information would do us now. [COUGHING] [GROANING] It's okay, buddy. We are leaving! He needs a medic! [GUNSHOT] This is my prisoner! No more killing! You are acting like a traitor! I'm no traitor! Take them! The officer is my prisoner to handle how I see fit. [GROANING] KEENE: I was forced to march for hours with a ration of water once a day. Sometimes I would find Ho staring at me. I couldn't figure out what the hell was on his mind. [GROANS] [SCREAMING] [BABY CRYING] Are you not friendly to the Viet Cong? It's for your children that we are fighting. Leave him alone! What? You heard me. The farmer needed to be frightened. He was. [GROANING] KHOI: Enough. What was the purpose of your patrol here? Blow it out your ass. That's your prisoner, Ho. You should be the one to bring him in. You should get the credit, not Khoi. Look at him down there. He's ambitious and stupid. If he keeps that up, he'll kill him. [KEENE GROANING] KEENE: While they slept, I was kept awake. [INAUDIBLE] And while they ate, I went hungry. [INAUDIBLE] And while they rested, I was beaten. That's enough, comrade! I will guard the prisoner. Go get some rest. The order from Khoi is that he doesn't sleep. I know. Go. Your turn to be a tough guy. Where are they taking me? North. You could have killed me. KHOI: My orders were to keep him awake! [GROANING] You'll answer for this. Only to Captain Tuong. [GROANING] He might have killed you. He's a comrade. Don't be so sure. Pham, do you trust me? What are you talking about? Of course. Then go to Captain Tuong. Tell him everything. [CHUCKLING] Tell him I'll bring in the prisoner myself. Khoi will just kill you both and say you were a traitor. Not if I get to Tuong first. Why does this American mean so much to you? He's just one of many we have to kill. Yes. But something happened with this man. Don't you remember when we captured him? Yes, I remember. He had his weapon pointed at you. That's right. So? So he could have killed me, but he didn't. Because I didn't give him a chance, that's why. No. It's more than that. I saw in his eyes. We've been fighting together for more than a year. And sometimes you get these crazy ideas. I have to do this, Pham, even if I might be wrong. We've always been told the end justify the means. But not this way. I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is I made friends with a crazy boy. [CHUCKLES] But I'll do what you say. Go now. [MUFFLED GRUNTS] [SHUSHING] HO: Get in there. Kneel down. What? [COCKS GUN] I said kneel down. Put your hands behind your back. You're a prisoner of the National Liberation Front. I'm taking you back alive. You try to escape, I'll deliver your head. Up. KEENE: Slow down. Hey, I can't keep up with you with my hands tied! Hey! Hey! Ho! Ho! I heard him call you that. Ho. That's your name, isn't it? That's right. Mine's Keene. Move faster now. Have three men stay with me. Send the rest back to Metang and let them know what has happened here. Tell Captain Tuong that I'm searching for the traitor Ho. BOY: Comrade. You're a brave man. Flower power. Don't understand what you're saying, round-eye. Fucking chickenshit hippies at home would get off on that. HO: Move it! [GROANING] You need help, comrade? What do you have there? My grandchild. Who killed him? Men like you. What happens when we reach your people? You'll answer for your crimes. And as an officer, you'll be asked to give information. If you refuse, they'll find ways to get what they need. Shit is what they'll get from me. Then you'll die. [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] That's right! I don't understand you. I fight for my country. My dedication to dau tranh. Our dignity has been insulted and land taken away from us. Land that Vietminh won back from the French. What do you fight for, round-eye? I'm a soldier. My country called. It shouldn't have. How old are you? What difference does it make? How old are you? Old enough. Seventeen. You got a girlfriend? Huh? [CHUCKLING] I've got a wife and a son about your age. Back in the world. Where? Back home in Chicago. You know where that is? I've seen American movies. Maybe you'll visit someday. Sure, someday. You ever afraid of anything, Keene? I'm afraid you might offer me one of those. A VC delicacy. You'd like to kill me, wouldn't you? I'm not going to let you take me back alive. I'm no good to you dead. Let me go. Tell them I escaped. They won't blame you. You're talking to a soldier, remember that! Just like you. Then I guess we're both fucked. Some people are more fucked than others. [CHUCKLES] We leave early. KEENE: I had to get back and report. Thousands of lives depended on it. I was beginning to respect Ho, but I would have killed him in order to escape. Ho! I can't swim with my hands tied. That water's too deep. Ho! Shit! [GRUNTS] [CHUCKLING] Son of a bitch. This fucking thing is underwater. No wonder aerial photographs never show a bridge. SOLDIER: They've been here. HO: We stop here. Dig. Sit over there. Hands on your head. The knife, toss it on the ground over there. I could still use something to eat. KHOI: You have a lot to learn, Ho! Don't! You have no reason to fear us. We are comrades. You're confused. We understand that. Do you, Comrade Khoi? Just give me your prisoner. I'll bring him in and you won't fall into shame. When we go before the dau tranh, it'll be justifying your proper spirit. And the American? [SIGHS] He'll no longer be yours. He'll be none of your concern. [GROANING] Remember who this man is, comrade. I'll hold you responsible for this, Khoi. You are in no position to make demands. That man was a traitor. But there's been enough killing between brothers. I'll speak on your behalf. The prisoner is mine now, comrade. [HELICOPTERS APPROACHING] That's why you're here. You want Metang. Take the men back to Metang. Warn them. What's the strength of your forces? Battalion strength? Fuck you. It doesn't matter. We're prepared, round-eye. Comrade Ho, he's of no use to me now. You may kill him. Do it! Finish it! [SHOUTING] [GROANS] [GROANING] [GUN COCKS] KEENE: I was lucky to flag down a medevac chopper and make my report. They cleaned me up and sent me back to my unit. The Metang assault was on. [PEOPLE CLAMORING] [GUNFIRE] Hurry up! Get over here! You have much to explain, Ho. Yes, I do. But now it's a major fight! Watch it! Watch it! [SOLDIERS SHOUTING] SOLDIER 1: Move it out! MAN: You can't kill them with that. SOLDIER 2: Over here! Stuck in the mud! SOLDIER 3: I need a medic! Medic! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Medic! Stay with him! [PEOPLE SHOUTING] Come on! Cover me! Come on, hurry up! Hurry up! Come now, Ho! We are moving out now! I'm staying. You'll be alone! I want it that way. Fireball Three, revert back. [GROANING] Hey, what you got out there? Give me something heavy up here! Put one in there! Fireball Three, we're pinned down here. We need air support. PILOT ON RADIO: Copy. I see your position. Hold on to your seats. [PANTING] SOLDIER: Incoming! [PANTING] SOLDIER: Keep going! Keep going! SOLDIER 1: Watch your intervals! SOLDIER 2: Watch for traps! Spread out! Somebody's been through here! Hold your fire. SOLDIER 1: We got something over here! SOLDIER 3: He's got a grenade, sir. KEENE: I see that. Everybody hold your fire, is that clear? SOLDIER 1: Yes, sir! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Ho, don't do it. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Medic! KEENE: After they took Ho, I found his diary lying where he had fallen. I heard he made it. I never saw him again, but I had come to understand that on the other side of the barrel of a gun, there was a man like me.
