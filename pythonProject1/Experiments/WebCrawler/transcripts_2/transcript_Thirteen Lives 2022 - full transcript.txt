foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Tackle him, Chai. You can do it, Chai. Come on, Chai. Let's go eat. Hey Prem. Your mother bought a Sponge Bob cake for your birthday party. Sponge Bob cake for a little boy! Stop giving me a hard time. Guess where we're going? Before your party, let's go to the cave. Yeah, the cave for the birthday boy! I'll race you to the park. Then I better go with you. We have to go quickly, it'll be dark soon. Coach, my dad's cooking for the party. I promised to help. You're a good son. See you at the party. Okay, bye. See you at 7pm. Go! Go! Hey, Arm! Go! Ahh! Go, walk slowly. This is always the best part. Keep going! I told Prem to come straight home after practice. Well, if they stop over tell them we're waiting to start the party. Sorry I'm late. The shop got really busy. You're Chai's mom, right? That's right. I want to watch the games but I'm always working. Bye. Looks like they did go to the cave. All of them? In this rain? It wasn't raining earlier. Excuse me. Shouldn't we drive to the cave and get them? They'll get soaked riding back. What are they thinking staying in the cave this late. Heavy rain is forecast in Northern Thailand as the monsoon season starts early. Monsoon? That usually starts in July. It can't be the monsoon. That cave floods every year. That's Chai's bike! We're the parents who called ahead. Have you seen the boys? We've looked and can't go any further. The cave's flooding. We called the authorities. It's flooding. How can the boys get out? I've already asked for help. Please wait. Let's go in and get them. Calm down and wait for help. Chai! Chai! Chai! Can you hear me? Chai! Chai! I just started my dinner. Sorry, Governor. Have the SEALs been deployed? They're already on the ground, sir. - Is that them there? - Yes. This is Vern Unsworth. I'm the Governor of the province. You are? Captain Arnont Sureewong. Navy SEALs, sir. Move everything to the tent. I need an update. My men will enter with scuba gear. This way, please. This man lives nearby, sir. He knows the cave. Hello. I've mapped it. All of it. Now, I haven't been in when it's flooded. It's a whole 'nother game. You have to be a bit nuts. But, look, there's some pretty tight corners in there. A real squeeze. But there are some big chambers too. Let me show this to my men. Please. Let's go. Maybe I could find you something to eat, sir? That would be kind. This could be a long night. Start laying guideline from here. It's a deep cave, several kilometers long, with some narrow passages. If the boys have gone a long way in, it could take several more hours. But I have every confidence in the Navy SEALs. Hello, Governor. The SEALs are coming. We couldn't find the boys. We hit a flash flood. There's no visibility or space to maneuver. The currents are too strong and shifting. It's been two days since the Wild Boars football team got trapped in the cave. Thai authorities have activated over one hundred government agencies. In an astonishing nationwide effort to rescue the boys, volunteers have also joined the effort, pumping water out of the cave. There is mounting pressure on officials to help these boys by any means necessary. Minister. Governor. Bring me up to speed. Pumping has begun, Minister. I know that. With the largest pumps in the region. I ordered them myself. So far the divers have been unable to get through as the water is so high. The flooded sections are very narrow and difficult to navigate. The current is very strong. You haven't found the boys? And you don't know where they are? Or even if they're alive? I know you were to be transferred out next week but you'll remain here as Governor until this is done. They tell me you're the guy who knows this mountain best. Sure. You know the cave is flooded. There are boys trapped in there. Who are you? Thanet Natisri, I'm a water engineer from Bangkok. The government sent for you? No I just came, like everyone else. There's no time to wait for help from the officials. The rain water is flooding into the cave. It's coming from above, not below. We have to stop it getting in. I need to find all the sinkholes and divert them. I know many like this. Yeah, John? Uh, hey, Rick, you following what's happening in Thailand? Some kids stuck in a cave. Yeah, no, not really. Why? How did they get themselves in there? Uh, I don't know. Doesn't say. Well, if they walked in, they can walk out. The Thai government's been given a list of rescue divers. We're on the list. What cave is this? Uh, Tham Luang. Hey, Matthew, that'll be your mum. Matthew. Okay, okay. Vern mapped it a couple of years ago. Yeah, yeah. Got it. Up north. That's the one. Yeah. It's just a tourist cave. It looks easy, but Vern said when it's flooded, it's impossible. - Impossible for Vern. - Yeah. Get your stuff - together, all right? - Okay. Well, they've got teams climbing all over the mountain. They're drilling holes and searching... Holes? - Rick, one second. - Drilling holes? They don't need us, John. - Where's it this time, Dad? - Thailand. You got everything? - Yep. - Yeah? Give us a hug. - All right. See you later. - Come along, Matthew. See ya. Thanks, Annabel. I'll let you know if I have to go. - Okay. - Sorry. - Bye, Dad. - Bye, son. Rick, look, if you don't wanna do it, I'll just call Jason. Just call Jason if you'd rather go with Jason. I didn't say I'd rather go with Jason. I would rather go with you. Just to confirm, no one's actually asked for us yet? No, Vern just gave them our names and, you know, we should be ready in case they do ask for us. Maybe start packing if you think you're coming. Hmm. I don't even like kids. Okay, Rick. This is a massive rescue operation with over a thousand volunteers from all over the world. Thai volunteers are joined by volunteers from China, Japan, America, Britain and Australia. In order to reduce the water levels, Thai military and volunteers are working around the clock to pump water from the cave. Due to worsening conditions inside the cave, all rescue dive efforts have been put on hold. Hey, guys, I'm sorry, but we will have to walk from here. Got any custard creams left? Just one, okay? Yeah. Thanks. Did you take two custard creams? No. Yes, you did. You took two at once. You're like a child. - I'm like a child? - Okay, guys. It's the building on the left, next to the laundry. I will get the tanks and meet you there. - Okay. Thank you. - Okay? In World Cup Group H, Poland beat Japan by one goal to nil. So, what do we do now? We do what we came to do. Go in that cave. Seriously, I mean, I don't care about the custard creams, but it's like I tell my son, I care about trust. And I'm disappointed, Rick. But that's okay, that's okay. The cave is closed. No, we're meant to go in. The cave is closed. We just flew all the way from England. Can I help? Hello. I'm Rick Stanton, this is John Volanthen. We've been flown in by the Thai government to help. You are British army? No. British Cave Rescue Council. We're volunteers. The cave is flooded. - Yeah, we... - John. Hey, Vern, there seems to be a problem here. They're telling us the cave's closed. Yeah, well, it's getting bad in there. They're pulling everyone out. These are the men you want. I gave the governor their names. The governor sent for them? Sir, look at them. They're amateurs. They'll never survive the currents in the cave. No, no, no. They've done cave rescues all over the world. Our names must be on some list somewhere. I told the governor, - "These are the men you need." - Look, guys, the children are still in the cave, yeah? - Look, John... - Yeah, but... - Just a sec. - The clock is ticking. Look, lads, it's just that they don't want foreigners dying in the cave. It's not a good look. We won't die. I have zero interest in dying. How about you, John? Yeah, same. If the governor sent for them... You can dive. Thank you. Lads, first it's gonna be a series of small cascades, followed by a deeper wading section before your first dive. Your best chance is a large cave about two kilometers in. You're all right. I'll follow. I need a few more minutes to fix this pump. The water level is getting high. It's almost running. Let's have a look. Shit! That's it. We better head back. Wait, wait. You speak English? I fix pump, but water come fast. Bloody hell. We'll have to dive him out. - Can you swim? - Yes. Give me your mask. I'll take him out and come back. Okay. Right. You breathe through this. Breathe. Okay? Mask. Face in the water. Just try it. We swim together. All right? Here we go. Stop it! Help! Over here! That was exciting. Not in a good way. Did he make it out okay? Yeah. Hello. I'm the governor of this province. Grateful for your help. We went as far as we could. Didn't find the boys. How far did you get? T-junction. The T-junction is the same location my team got to. That's as far as they laid their line. I sent for them on good advice. I'm pursuing every avenue open to me. Yes, Governor. I'll let you know when the rescue operation can be resumed. I must ask, please, do not go in the cave again without my permission. Just a sec, boys. Sir? What was all that about? Well, in theory, the governor's in charge, but Captain Arnont's the Navy chief on the ground and he doesn't take orders from civilians. Plus, the rumor is, the governor's been sacked. This was supposed to have been his last week here, and now he's been ordered to stay on. Just in case they need a fall guy. Hmm. Hey, Vern. What's all that? That's a shrine to Princess Nang Non, the Sleeping Princess. This is her mountain. Nang Non mountain. They say when you see it from a distance, it looks like a sleeping princess. They say that her tears trapped the boys. The Sleeping Princess is angry. Angry? What's she angry about? I don't know. It's just what the local people say. Life threatening infections are a concern. We need to remember that every breath they take increases carbon dioxide levels. As oxygen decreases, physical exertion becomes more taxing. Right here, that's their tent. Sam! Hi, Captain. Hey. You're not at work? I took a vacation. So you broke free? I got bored of watching you on the news. Hey team, this is Sam an. Saman's one of us. He served under me for ten years. We chased pirates together. I brought my old scuba gear. I want to help. Welcome. Excuse me! Excuse me! Can I talk with you please? Sir, my boy is in the cave and now it's flooding. I don't know if my son is alive or dead. All I ask from you, sir, is to bring me his body. Excuse me, governor? Major Charlie Hodges. US Air Force, Okinawa. This is Captain Olivia Taft. Governor. We're the nearest Special Operations Squad. But we have medics, comms, logistics experts. We'll do whatever we can to help. Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. Everyone! We're going to get started now. So, we think that the boys were heading for here. They call it Pattaya Beach. With the high water level and the low visibility, and the difficulty of the cave itself, our divers were not able to reach them. So, now, the question is, when do we go back in? And who is going in? We need the rain to stop, and let the pumps do the work. And then, we go in. We can go in now. Yeah. No offense, but you're trained to dive in open water, not confined spaces. Rick and I have been diving in caves just like this for 30 years now. It takes a certain kind of mindset for the deep cave diving. Breathing techniques, special ways of moving. It's just different. I'm responsible for my men. As for anyone else, that's for the governor to decide. No one will go in for now. We'll wait for the rain to stop. Thank you. We need to build dams for every sinkhole. Seems like he just showed up on his own, sir. The men working with him are local villagers. I don't believe we've met. I'm the water guy. You are American? I live in Illinois but I'm from Bangkok. I was in Bangkok when I heard the news. I rounded up some volunteers and here we are. I am the governor. Tell me how you can help. Of course. There's a network of mountain streams carrying water through all the fissures and cracks into the cave. That's what's creating the strong currents. If we find a way to divert these streams, the water level will drop. I thought that's why we're pumping water out of the cave below. No, sir. Those pumps are useless. The cave is at the bottom, water will keep running in from above. Can you stop that? We are trying. But there's a price to pay. You've all been in the cave. You know how the water comes in from the mountain above. Now we want to divert the water down the side of the mountain, away from the cave, onto your fields. We will lose our crop? Yes. This will save the boys? Honestly, I can't promise anything. Um... But it will give the boys a chance. Agreed. For the boys. With this much-needed break in the monsoon rains, consensus among the many volunteers here is that the search for the boys and their coach may soon resume. The frustration for the families, though, is that nobody seems to know when that might be, or indeed, how it will take place. Nine days after they entered this huge cave system, the questions remains as to whether the boys can still be rescued. Suppose they're alive in there. What's it like for them? Why say that? I was just wondering. Huh. I can just about see her. Princess Nang Non. We've just received word that a water diversion operation is underway. Volunteers are building dams and positioning pipes in order to redirect the water from the mountain into the surrounding fields. Rescue teams hope that this will limit the flow of water into the cave and allow the pumps to reduce the water levels inside. I asked if Kruba could come and he's here already. Lek, Lek. Can you take these to Kruba? Excuse me. Kruba, please could you bless these for me? Thank you. I'm told the pumps are working and the rain has stopped. When can the SEALs go in again? For the waters to recede, at least twenty-four hours. The British divers are ready to go in. Our team is preparing. I think it's too risky to let them in now. They're amongst the best in the world at diving in these conditions. Let's use them as scouts and see what happens? Sir, the Minister requests an update. Video. If you get past T-junction. Please, take care. Pattaya Beach. Hello! Hello! All right. I'll keep left. Feel out for bodies. You smell that? Yeah. Okay. Nearly out of line. Hey. They're here. How many? Hello? - Hello. - Hello! - Hello. - Hello. How have they done that? Thank you. English. English. English? Thank you. How many of you? - Thirteen. - Thirteen? They're all alive. - Thirteen? - Yes. Brilliant! Brilliant. Uh, can we go out now? Uh, no, not today. No, there are just two of us. We must dive. But many people are coming. It's okay. We are the first, but... But... But many will come. Many more. You've been here ten days. Ten days! You are very strong. Very strong. We are hungry. I know, I know. I know. I understand. Okay, go back. We will come. Go on back. Uh, what day you come and help us? Uh... - We help tomorrow. - Tomorrow? There are more divers. - Thai divers. - Thai? We'll come tomorrow with food and doctors, and everything. Don't, John. You don't know that. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You are very brave. How have you stayed so strong? We are team and we help each other. And our coach help us. Coach. I offer my most sincere apologies for leading the boys into danger. It's not true! Coach helped us! We love our coach! He's the best! It is because of our coach we stay strong. He teach us to, uh, meditate. - And, uh, we pray. - You pray? - Yes, yes. - I bet you do. All right. How... How did you find us? We dig. We dig. This is to get out? Good work. Uh... We hear a sound in the cave. We are very scared. No need to be scared now. It's just water. It's just the cave. I hear it too, it's just... John... We should get back. All right. Right. Here. The batteries are fresh. Thank you. You stay strong. Good luck. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Hello! - Hello! - Hey! We found the boys. They're alive. Careful who sees that. The old men found the boys! Do we know how many? How many of you? They found the boys! Thirteen? They're all alive. I can't believe it. They're alive! - Thirteen? - Yes. Brilliant! They found the boys. Everyone's alive. They're safe. Everyone's alive? They found the boys! They found the boys! Oh, shit. Everybody knows. That didn't take long. Rick, John, how are the boys doing? Where did you find the boys? Are there any injuries? We're going to bring you some breaking news now. Reports coming in from Chiang Rai, Thailand. Specialist cave rescue divers Rick Stanton, a retired firefighter, and John Volanthen, an IT consultant, have found the missing boys and their football coach. Last seen nine days ago and presumed trapped in the flooded caves, all twelve boys and their coach are now confirmed to be alive. Christ, there's more of 'em now. Come on, we should just go. Let's go. Straight to the van. Let's move you back inside. Back inside. Back inside. Just head back in. Come on, guys, let's just give 'em some space, okay? Thank you. Been a long day. Can you please comment on US involvement? Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Okay. Thank you so much. You found them. The news guys can be a pain in the butt. You just gotta handle them right. What do you want me to tell them? "We found the boys. Now let's all watch 'em die." Okay, Rick, take it easy. I'm just telling it like it is. All this water pumping, flooding fields, praying to shrines, it's bullshit! I'm not having it. The Thai SEALs are going in tomorrow. Those boys are never coming out. Never. Our most experienced divers are going to... No, sir. It's not about your divers. We brought a man out on our first dive, and he completely panicked. Almost drowned. And that was a very short swim. You try and dive those kids the whole way, all you'll be bringing out is dead bodies! Governor! Governor! Governor! Okay, let's get you guys out of here. Okay. Come on. This is exactly what I didn't want. Well, you knew we'd find them. I didn't expect to find them alive. Well, it's done now. Okay, can we go, Bas, please? Sorry. It's okay. When will they come back? Maybe they won't come. They'll come when they're ready. We must be ready. Fear is created in our minds. Close your eyes. Let your mind be at peace. Feel the air you breathe in and out. Breathe in. Breathe out. Slowly. We are standing by at the base camp of the rescue mission. Rescuers are attempting to find alternative ways to reach the cave. Experts believe the boys will never survive three months of monsoon rains and flooding. Still using the same Scubapro regulator from my time. On your first dive, you made it to the T-junction? I did, yeah. Do you want a briefing on the rest of the way? Yeah, please. Come in. You made it here. You have a 250-meter dive here, with a narrow rift, barely shoulder-wide, to Chamber 7. Then you have to de-kit and carry your gear over a long rock shelf to get to Pattaya Beach. Then comes a tough dive. It's a long, shallow tunnel, bit more twisty than this, 350 meters. No visibility. Pulling against very strong currents. No headroom at all. And there's undercuts on all the bends. They're very, very dangerous. So, you must always keep to the wider side of the line, or you'll get trapped. At the end of that, you'll reach the boys. And it's a very physical dive. So, try and save two-thirds of your air going in, so you can make it back. We will get there. We'll reach the boys today. Yeah. Let's pack up. Best of luck, Kiet. Thank you. Thank you. Good luck. They'll do a good job. Those are our boys in there. Hmm. Look, I know your men are tough, but it's not gonna be easy for them. Navy SEALs. Not bad for eleven days without food. The boys in the north, they're tough. We have a little food and batteries. Two bites each. We must save them for later. Coach. I'm a doctor. I'm going to check the boys. What's your name? Arm. Arm. You're very strong. Kiet. The oxygen in the cave is below twenty. Jay. We only have enough air for one of us to get back. We used more tanks than we planned on. Take it and return to base. Report the oxygen meter is close to the red zone. You understand the situation? We're staying here with you. Bring Jay some water. He's cramping! Now you see why the Minister left me in charge. Now the Navy SEALs have reached the boys. They will support the boys, as we prepare for next stage of the rescue. I give my word to everyone, the boys will come out safely. Governor, sir. Excuse me, Governor. How can I help? Can I speak with the Governor please? The Governor is busy. I can help you. Our families are Shan. We don't have ID cards. Will they still help our boys? Will they rescue them too? Is everything okay? Well, she's afraid her boy won't be rescued. They are Shan from Myanmar, just over the border. Stateless. Don't worry, your son will be rescued from the cave with all the others. You should be proud of your son. He's been very patient. Governor! It's been twelve days already. Inside it's dark and cold with no food. How long can the boys be patient? When are you getting them out? There are three SEALs staying with the boys. We're planning to send food in. I understand how you must feel. How can you understand? Is your son going to die? Somebody's gonna have to come up with something. Rick. Whoa. What are you thinking? Just a crazy idea. So tell me. Rick, crazy is better than nothing. We've got nothing. We call Harry. - Harry? - Mmm. Doctor Harris. - That's brilliant. - Mmm. Or insane. Or both. Don't know if he'd do it. I... I don't know the man, but, I mean... I bet he'd come if he thought it was just to lend a hand. Hmm. He might buy that. He's a good diver. Yeah. We could use a couple more divers who can handle rescue work anyway. I was thinking Jason. You know? If he's not too pissed off that he hasn't been asked already. Maybe Chris Jewell. You think Chris will be up to it? - Everyone says he's excellent. - Mmm-hmm. Jason says he's strong. Of course, he's never done a rescue like this. I'll call him. - Yeah? - Okay. Chris, let me show you. So, you are carrying one meal a day for one week for everyone in the cave. - All right. Okay. Yeah. - Okay. Jason, keep an eye on Chris, yeah? Yeah. He'll be all right. He's young. Remember young, Rick? I'm not that far behind. We have food. Thought the kids might like to write back to their parents. Yeah. Good. Thank you. Paper to write letters. It's strange. The parents thanking me for taking care of their children. I thought they would blame me. No one blames you, Coach. Somebody get these to their parents. Notes from the boys. Okay. So, did I pass? - What? - Did I pass? No, you were terrible. - You did great. You did great. - Good. Well, that's quite a dive. How the hell do you think we're gonna get those kids out? We're working on it. Just seconds left on the clock. Neymar couldn't do it with that last check. And that's it, the whistle's blown. Belgium beat Brazil. The favorites have been knocked out of the World Cup. Belgium are through to the semi... I'll get the bags. Thanks, Bas. Hey, Harry. Glad you made it. Mate, thanks for bringing me in. Oh, sure. - Good to meet you, Harry. - Well, what a pleasure. - How was the flight? - Oh, that was pretty good. It's just, gettin' the permits is a bloody hassle. You wanna see the cave? Yeah. That's what I'm here for. - Come on, then. - All right. The families, they've been here since day one. Oh, imagine what they're going through. We managed to bring some letters to them from the kids. Oh, yeah? And in about 2.5k, there they are. That's it. So, who else answered the call? Who else you got here? Oh, there's divers coming in from all over the place. We've got Jason Mallinson with us and Chris Jewell. Wow. The Awesome Foursome. I'm not in the same league as you guys, but... But you've got a skill none of the rest of us have, Harry. What's that? Well, he's talkin' about your area of expertise. I'm an anesthetist. Right. No. No! No, no, no. No. It's their only chance. Rick, it's insane. It's unethical. It's... It's illegal, all right? And anyway, it just wouldn't work. Well, you don't know that. It's never been done before. No, you'll kill 'em. They're gonna die anyway. Look, I mean... we've tried. We... We've thought of everything. Yeah, so you called Doctor Harry. I didn't come here to kill kids, Rick. I came here to help you save 'em. - Okay. - Yeah? Yeah, you're right. You're right. I mean, we're... We're just desperate. - It's a bad idea. - Yeah. - It's the only idea. - Leave it, Rick. Yeah. Harry's the expert. If he says it can't be done, then it can't be done. Anything else I can do, - I will do. - Sure. Obviously, I took an oath, and I... Understood. - We'll just keep exploring. - Yeah? - Yeah. Keep exploring. - Yeah. It's good to have you on board, Harry. Okay. Oh, Rick. As the oxygen level decreases in the cave, Thai Navy SEALs are doubling their efforts to help the trapped boys. The air we breathe contains about twenty-one percent oxygen. The level in the cave is less than sixteen percent. Sam an. You okay? Thanks for letting me take wetsuits to the boys. I'm happy you could lend a hand. I'll help. Thanks Sam an. Mmm. The recent death of Thai Navy SEAL Sam an Gun an is reminding everyone of just how incredibly dangerous and challenging it is in the caves. This was a trained Navy diver. As for Saman's funeral, the government will arrange a funeral with full honors. How much more difficult will it be for the 12 children and their coach? Rescuers are now attempting to source diving equipment and wet suits for the smallest of the boys. With no alternate entrances and oxygen running low, diving them out still appears to be the best option. The entire nation is anxiously waiting for what will happen next. Call me back. Yeah. There will be no more Navy divers going beyond Chamber 3 until further notice. Sorry. Sorry, guys. Hi, hun. Jesus Christ. Hey, Matthew. It's Dad. Dad! Are you coming home? Uh, not for a few days yet. We heard someone died out there. Yeah, yeah, one of the Thai divers. A fellow named Sam an. He was... He was just helping out, and... Yeah, yeah, it's sad. Do you think you'll get the boys out? We will if we can. We're just trying to figure it out. I mean, it's complicated, but we're trying... We're trying to figure it out now. Uh, anyway, how are things with you? You doin' okay? Do you want one? Uh, no. I just found out my dad's been taken to a hospital. So, they're just running a few tests. His heart's never been very good. Sorry to hear about that. He's pretty tough. He's made it to 88. Um, listen. If we had the right backup, maybe, just maybe one or two or three, if we're lucky, of those kids might just make it through. But you're talking about a five-hour dive. - Right. - That means that they're gonna have to have top-up shots along the way. And then you got the saliva problem. Even if the masks hold, there's a very good chance they're gonna choke, all right? The whole thing is insane. I don't even know why I'm saying it. 'Cause a man's already died. - Yeah. - And those kids don't have much time left. Harry. We do nothing, we'll be bringin' 'em out dead for sure. But if they die while we're bringin' 'em out, at least we will have tried. Sedated? How sedated? Fully. Fully unconscious. It's the only way we can dive them out. Mmm. They have to be inert. Completely still. We'll take them out like packages. And you are an anesthetist? Yes. Yes, I am. Preeya. Don't write this down. How safe is this procedure? I just can't answer that. Because I've never done it before. As far as I know, nobody ever has. In... In theory, it could work. But we're talking about administering anesthetics under conditions where we just can't monitor the effect. So, too much and respiration can just shut down. And too little and, uh... If they wake up under water, they can drown. So, you are expecting, uh, casualties? Yes. I expect casualties. Minister, here! Governor! The minister is coming. Governor, over here! Sir! The operation may now proceed. Yes, Minister. May you be successful. No one must know about the... the method you propose. Not even the parents. Do your best. And if we fail, the failure is mine alone. Okay. Your volunteering and effort is critical. The faster the waterways can be diverted before the monsoons return, the more time we can buy for the boys. They're telling us the dams are helping. It makes it possible for the divers to reach the boys. But if we don't build enough, when the monsoons arrive, the boys will drown. ...not involved in the operation, please kindly leave the base camp area. Attention, please. All media and those not involved in the operation, please leave the base camp area. What's going on? It's the TV guys, the news guys, they're all being sent away. So they don't see the bodies come out. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry, I don't understand. For you, for the boys. From Chai's mom, Buahom. - Buahom? - Yes, yes, yes. Blessed by the holy man. Okay. John. Thank you. Here. For good luck. Don't believe in luck. Just take it, take it. She's watching, come on. All right. We'll be having to give them repeat hits of Ketamine along the way. We're givin' 'em ket? Yeah. Now, the injection goes through the wet suit, into the thigh muscle here or here. Each dose should last about 30 minutes. Keep a little bit of, see, space on the needle there. Push in and out. It's quite simple. But when they start waking, you guys are gonna have to top 'em up immediately. Yeah? Boss. Well done, Jas. Just try again. - Good luck. - Hmm. Good luck to us all, Captain. - John. - Captain. I pray to the Guardian Spirit of the forest to apologize for the thirteen boys. If they have offended you, intentionally or unintentionally, I apologize to all spirits in the forest. And spirits everywhere. Everyone at the ceremony would like to pray for the thirteen young boys to come back home safely. It's Chamber 5, lads. The SEALs ran electric cable. Got some lights in here. Roughly halfway. These are spare tanks the SEALs brought in for the boys. Copy. Josh, you and Connor wait for us here. Right, mate, yeah. All right, I stop here. When the first boy gets through the long dive, I swim to you and report. 'Cause if it's not working out, we need to know before we bring any more out. But if it is workin'... - Then we get on with it. - Right. They're packages. We're just the delivery guys. Right. Okay, lads. Let's do it. Yep. Let's go. Good luck. Good luck, Harry. This will sting a little. Today's the day. We're gonna start diving the boys out. We can take four. They are taking us out today. But they can only take four. They're taking us out. From your mom. Blessed by Kruba. - Doctor Karn. - Yeah. This is Doctor Harris. Doctor Karn. Hey. - Doctor Harry. - Doctor Karn. Doctor, um, you need to know what we're proposing here. That's for you. So, who's going first? Chai, Arm, Aat, Poom. Chai, you go first. Guess I am first. All right, chin in. - Uh... No way. No. - No? No way, it's not gonna seal. We'll get you a better mask. They have to find a mask to fit you. Today? Probably tomorrow. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. I promise. Good lad. Decha, you go. Ready to go. Open your mouth, Decha. Arms up. Turn about. You'll be home soon. He's tying Decha's hands. It will be okay. Don't let the boys watch. There's no need to scare them with needles. Step in front. Good lad. Move back, turn around. A-ha. The lucky first customer. Come on. Yep. Steady as you go. Here we go. Come into my comfy office. Now, I'm Harry. And you're a very brave boy, you're number one. And you're lucky, 'cause you get Jason. He is the number one diver in all the world. Have you been missing the World Cup? Huh? Well, guess what? Brazil got knocked out, huh? You would've seen one of these before. That was a shock, wasn't it? Brazil, huh? Guess who knocked 'em out? Belgium. Bet they're really upset about that. Belgium. Get you out of here so that you can watch the rest of the games, huh? Mmm. Tough guy, huh? Didn't even feel that one. Mmm. Easy, huh? Easy. Look away. Good on the chin. All right, you wanna take him? Yeah, good, good. All right, good, bring him back. Okay, his head back. Most certainly. - Good. - Yeah. - Slow. - Good. Let's pull that back. All right, check for breathing. All right. Looks good. Feet. Okay. Okay. He's been breathing just fine. Fucking brilliant. You didn't think it would work? Me neither. All right. I'm off. Good luck. And look, you're lucky because see this? That's John. He's diving you out and he is the number one diver in the whole world. And I know it's been pretty exciting for you in here, but guess what? Bit of excitement in the World Cup. Belgium knocked out Brazil. Harry, Harry. Did you give him the shot? Oh, shit. We were supposed to wait till we heard Jason made it out okay. Yeah. I've done the atropine, and I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna have to keep going. No panic. No panic. Yeah. Yeah, carry on. We gotta get on with it. I don't wanna risk my boy waking up. Not so bad, huh? - Oh, man, I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Good. Kiet, you know my lad's name? - Arm. - Arm? He's the team captain. Okay. It's working. Oh, jeez. Yeah, he's good. See you out there. - Yeah. - Yeah. Good luck, Chris. - Jason okay? - Jason's through. Good. - Careful. - Okay. Yeah, easy, easy. - Slow, slow, slow. - Okay. - Slowly, slowly. - New cylinder. I'll give him another dose. Okay, so I've got him. Okay. - Coming off. - Okay. He all right? Nice. Boy's good. All right, let's bring him over. All right. Step. - Thanks. - Yeah. - Careful. - Yep. Turning him around. Okay. There we go. One, two, three. Turn him over. No, he's not breathing. No, he's okay. He's okay. He's breathing. Okay. Yeah. Again. - Yep. - Yeah. Slowly. Fuck! He's not breathing. No. Mask off. - Mask off. - Easy. - Here we go. - Easy, easy. Okay. Right, that's it. Mask off. Okay. Gettin' there. Okay, let me in. Okay... Breathe. Breathe. Okay, he's breathing. Every time I put him under the water, he stops. You all right? Yep. Okay. Mask on. Okay. All right. Steady. Good work, Josh. - Okay. - Good luck. John, you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Just give me a minute, please. Is he all right? He's all right. Hey, is he, uh, still breathing okay? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, bring him over. Okay. Okay, Arm. Gentle. Yeah, he's good. All right. - Thanks, boys. - Cheers. Okay, let's go, let's go! Watch the head! Everybody, get ready to take that. One, two, three. Faster, faster. Gently. How is he? He's still breathing. Careful with his head. Oxygen coming. Make sure you're ready. Got shallow breaths. Okay! Let's go, let's go! Vital signs are stable. Okay, nice and easy, nice and easy. Easy, guys. Nice and easy, nice and easy. Get him out, get him out. A boy is coming out! The Governor asked me to tell everyone the rescue is going well so far. Why can't we have names? I'm afraid we can't release any details. I know how hard it must be for all of you but when the operation is complete, you'll be the first to know. Why does it have to be a secret? Okay. Ready, we're ready. Yeah, he's okay. He's okay. Good. Careful. - John. - Jason. You okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was, uh... It's tough. Hey, John. - John? - Yeah? - You all right? - Yeah. Yeah. It's just, uh, my lad was called Arm... Well, he stopped breathing for a minute. I thought he... I thought he was... But he's not. He's okay. He's okay. Well done, Chris. It's not easy. Thanks, John. Thanks. Medic. Medic? Um, what happened? It was four out of four, Doctor. Four what? All the boys are fine. Great job. Yeah. We understand that a team of elite divers is attempting to guide the boys through a three-kilometer underwater swim to safety. "Swim to safety." I like that. Got any custard creams left? No. What do you have? I ate them all. - Knob. - The media were relocated to clear additional space for essential military and volunteer personnel. The rescue operation is shrouded in secrecy... Yesterday, they said if we got one boy out alive, we'd be heroes. Now, we bring a single one out dead... Yeah. The air tanks are all strategically placed along the route. During yesterday's rescue, they used every single tank. The Governor of Chiang Rai Province called this, "A War With Water." Local forecasting is predicting heavy rain. No need to be scared, Rit. You know why? Because you have the best diver. Ready? Look up. Good boy. See? All over. All over. There you go. Good boy. I am Dew. I'm Rick. Bring down more pipe! There's no more! Is that the last of the pipe? We've sent for more from Bangkok. Need more pipe? Pipe. Yeah, they're good. - Okay. - Sixth is on the Skedco. We're hearing that five boys have been brought out of the cave today. Recent weather reports show storm clouds on the horizon. The monsoon season is closing in fast. Hell yeah, man! Yeah! Mask for Chai. Flown in from Bangkok. All right. Nah. Ah! Think it'll fit? Yeah, it better do. It is smaller. Have a seat, Bas. Thank you. Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? You wanna keep it like that, okay? That's a lot of water. Water level's gonna be rising in there. For sure. We'll still make it through, though, right? Don't know. We dive and we find out. It depends, Jason. Rick and I have been in there when it's fully flooded. It's a beast. Come on. We're not stopping now. You die in a cave if you want to, Jason. If I'm not sure of coming out, I'm not going in. Hurry. It won't stop raining. We need more sandbags. Everyone, there are three sinkholes in the rocks to the east. Okay. We can make it. - We better move fast. - Okay, lads. All right, Harry. Everyone leaves today. We do this as fast as we can. All right. No, see, that's open. It's not gonna seal. Yeah. It's buckling. All right, let's dive the others out. Then we'll get him sorted. Yeah? Okay, I got this. It's pink. I like it. All right, so, who's next? I can't swim. Will we survive? Don't be afraid. We have to trust them. Okay. Okay, turn around. Who have we got here? - This is Prem. - Prem. Come on down, Prem. Let's get you outta here. Are we the last to go? Mmm. Chris is diving you out. You know, Chris, see, he's the number one rescue diver in the whole world. That's me. All right. Prem, you know the drill. You've seen this. Do you wanna look up? Ready? All right. Yep. Off you go. All right. One more to go. Your choice. Up or down? Up. There you go. That was pretty painless. We're gonna get you home. Maybe for dinner. Hmm? Hmm. It's the best we can do. If I pull it too tight, it'll collapse the seal. It's still a little loose. We don't have time. The water is rising. If he doesn't come out now, he doesn't come out. I'll keep it from bumping. I can hold it if I have to. It's your call. I'll be going slow. So give me some space before you follow. The boys? Are they out safely? We hope so. Your turn now. He's no heavier than the boys. I'll be right behind you. Not too close. See you at the pub. All right. I guess it's our turn now. You go. We follow. Yeah. I mean, remember, the current is much stronger than it was. - And the water is, you know. - Yeah. The clock is ticking, putting pressure on the rescue team. The fear is the heavy downpour will push water back into the cave faster than the volunteers can divert the rain from the mountain. Yes, one more, one more. Hello? Hello, hello, hello! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, come on. Keep his head up. Start cutting through the next one. Reset for 11. Okay, Jason. I've got him. Okay? Three, two... He's good. He's good. Steady now, lads. We got a visual. Chris. Rick. It's really good to see you. I didn't know if anyone was gonna be able to... Is he alive? - Uh, yeah. - Yeah? No, yeah, he is, yeah. I... I lost the line back there. I found a power cable and followed it here. I, uh... I don't know where I am. You're still in Chamber 4. Well done. Keep him topped up. You'll be fine. Wait for Harry. He's coming now. Let him have a look, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Your only duty is to that boy. We'll get you out. So get ready. Yeah. Okay. Put his mask on and do whatever Harry says is best. Got it? See you on the other side. Where's Chris? - Still in Chamber 4. - Okay. - Coach is breathing. - Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Mister John. - He's fine, he's fine. - Okay. Easy with him. Coach looks good. How's Chris gettin' on? He's struggling a bit. Told him to wait for Harry. Chris? Yeah. What's happened? I, uh... I lost the line. Is your boy okay? I think so. You, uh, might wanna check him. Did you give him a top-off? Yeah, I gave him one about an hour ago, I think. Yeah, let's give him another hit. Okay. Do you want me to maybe take over from here? Uh... No, no, no. I should... I should do it. It's the U-bend. Um... Well, I mean, Rick said, uh... I mean, he just... He said to just do what you said, so... Uh... Well, I reckon you've done the hardest part. Why don't I do the last bit? And that way I could say that I was a rescuer, too. I mean, Rick just said to do what's best for the boy. I really think that that's what's best. - Okay? - Yeah. Okay. The pump is going! The pump's gone! Come on, Chris. Come on. Harry! Is the boy good? Yeah, he's fine. How about Chris? He's right behind me. Rick. Rick! I'm gonna get my cylinders. I'll go back for him. He'll be here. Nice one, Chris! - Well done. - Thanks. - My boy, is he... - He's alive. We bloody did it, lads! - Chris, okay? - Yeah. Not all out yet. Everyone out! The pumps are exploding! Hey, hey, hey! Pichai. Okay. Oh. Good to see ya. Okay. Well done, boys. Well done, old man. Good job. - Thank you, Rick. - Thank you, Captain. - Great work, Captain. - John. - Great job, guys. - Thank you. - So great. So great. - Well done. - Thank you so much. - Harry. - Legend. Legend, mate. - Well done, lads. Guys, I'm sorry about the... The line. It just kept... Hey, it's okay. It's done. - Yeah. It worked. - It's okay, Chris. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just thought I was gonna have to leave him in there. You all have come from all over. From the nearby town. Others, from different countries around the world. You have given your time. Your expertise. Some, even the rice crops. Hello. And you ask for nothing in return. But I know that you all did this for one reason. The love for the boys. It's okay. We're okay. It's good. Thank you. Thank you very much, guys. Governor, will you be stepping down? You're welcome. Okay. Oh, all right. Yeah. Hey. Well, you did it, Harry. He just got word his dad died. That's everyone, sir. All but one. Hey. Hey. Come here. Hmm. Chai. Hi! Say "cheese." Cheese!
