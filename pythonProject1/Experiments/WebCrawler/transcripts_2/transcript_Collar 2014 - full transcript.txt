What is this fucking place? - Dude, a lady cop. This is awesome. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. Let's beat it. - Freeze! - Fuck. Call for backup. (dramatic music) (dark suspenseful music) - Slow down, who done did that to your face? Hey Maria, I'm talking to you. Who done did that? You get the papers at least? - Massive. His name is Massive. - What a fucking stupid name. - Where is he? Where is this fucking bum now? - He's in his cardboard box. - Would you shut the fuck up? - He's in the alley behind Johnson's. I need a fucking weapon. - We aint got one for you. You know what, fuck that man. Grab your sword, we're going giant slam. - We are so busted bro. - Shut up man. This night just keeps getting better. A fucking lady cop. - Yeah dude, did you see that? He owned both those cops man. Dude, we should go back there. I think I saw the chick cop drop her stun gun. - Yeah, I saw it go flying too. Didn't see where it landed but fuck making clips. We are making a documentary. Faces of Death, but real. - Dude exactly, this is gonna be fucking sick man. - Yeah, yeah. Your cell's still got juice right? - [Derrick] Yeah hold on, let me check. Yeah, we're all good bro. - [Steven] Okay good. Let's catch our breath then get some more filming. - But what if he turns on us too. Like, should we go get the stun gun? - No, using your cell as a flashlight will use way too much juice. Save it for filming until we think of something. - But what about the big fucker yo? - He saw us shooting the rape and he knew we were behind the shanty. - Dude. - That guy loves us. - I don't know, how do you know that though? - If he didn't, we'd be in that shopping cart by now. - Alright, let's do it. (dark eerie music) (crying) (dark eerie music) - Okay, okay. (dark eerie music) - Mother fuck of God. - Feed. Feed on her. (dark suspenseful music) - Tell me about this big fuck. How do you know him? - He moved behind Johnson's a week or so ago. He has a fucking shanty made out of boxes and shit. J, no one would go down that alley. Everyone is fucking terrified. - Afraid of what? This big re-re? - You don't understand, this guy is fucking crazy. He worships the devil and sacrifices things. - How did he end up with you? - Well, I was at Johnson's and I crouched a couple things and they caught me and were gonna call the cops so I made a run for it out the back door. No one followed me and now I know why. Fuck, J next thing I know I woke up and I was being sucker punched and attacked. - And no one saw any of this? - No, and these two fucks. These two hipster fucks, they crept in and filmed the entire thing J and didn't help or nothing. And then, oh Herald. Herald the fucking bum came in and Massive killed him too. Fuck, and that's when I got away. - What about these hipsters? Where they at? - I don't know J, I ran away. - So this bum. His name's Massive because he's a big guy? - Yes, he's a fucking monster. He's huge. - Five-o roll up on you. - Yeah, after a couple of blocks but I didn't give them my name or nothing. - Good girl. (crying) - No, don't do this. Please, please just don't do this. Oh God, don't do this, don't do this. Please just. You don't have to do this. You don't, oh God. (gagging) (coughing) Please just don't fucking do this. No, no! (gagging) (crying) Just kill me. Please just kill me. (crying) (laughing) (crying) (dark eerie music) - Dude, we got to help that fucking lady cop man. - This is so fucked. - Dude, he's gonna kill her. - I know, I know. I'm thinking. - Dude, maybe if we help that cop we'll look like heroes or some shit. - Or maybe we will get busted for filming one bum kill another bum, on our orders. - Dude, we didn't order him to do that. Like, we planted the seed but it's not like we did it. - Are you fucking kidding me? Dude, you gave him a broken bottle. - So? So what, he's a bottle collector man it's not like-- - I don't care, forget it. We're deviating from the plan. - Dude, we don't have a fucking plan. - Save the cop, look like heroes. Sounds like a plan to me. - Alright, agreed. I'll delete the shit from that bum killer earlier. - Okay, me too. We've got way better shit we can't go up river for anyway. - So what do we do now? - Distraction. - Distract the bum? - Yeah, let's go find him another play date. - Dude, you're confusing the shit out of me. So in order to do one good thing we have to do another bad thing too? - The cop is our golden ticket dude. She's money. Who gives a fuck about some derelict whore, homeless bitch. - Or even a junkie? - You got it, we'll lure someone back. Man or a woman, I bet he goes both ways. - Like a switch hitter. - Yeah, yeah okay. One of us stays, one of us goes. - I'll go. - Fuck that, we flip a coin. - Fine, fair enough. - Call it, heads or tails. - [Derrick] Heads. - [Steven] Tails. - Oh fuck me man. Dude. - Okay, you stay, I go. If shit gets hectic just text me. Otherwise, stay put or get some B-roll. - Dude, you better not book it without me man. - I won't, I'm coming back regardless.

Just don't. - And then they're all fucking dead. - So, what do you want to do about it? - I just need a knife. A big fucking knife. - You can't be serious. - I know you have lots. I've seen your collection when you were fucking me in the basement last time. Please? Come on. - I don't know. I mean, you told big J I tried to butt fuck you. - No I didn't. Okay, all I said was you were a little bit freaky and that's all. I didn't say nothing bad Ben. - You know doggy style doesn't mean anal right? I don't understand why people always think that. You can penetrate vaginally from behind. I mean, the holes are generally in that same area you know? Fuck, big J just had it all wrong. Now he's dead. Fuck, now I have to find another dealer. God and your boy, he had the best stuff. What the fuck am I gonna do now? (moaning) Yeah. Oh fuck, you feel that? - I do. You like the way my pussy feels you fucking nerd. - It feels like magic. That's my wand. I'm a sorcerer. Sex warlock. My dragon in your dungeon. - There you go, that's it. (moaning) - Yes, yes, yeah! (breathing heavily) - [Maria] You good? - [Benjamin] Yeah no, I'm fine. - [Maria] Did you like that? - [Benjamin] Yeah. - Can we get the knives now please? - [Benjamin] Can I just get, give me a minute. - No, no. - [Benjamin] Oh God alright. (crying) - Dana. Where are you? (suspenseful music) (breathing heavily) (crying) (groaning) - So, you're going after this big motherfucker all by yourself huh? - No one else is gonna do it. - [Benjamin] You can call the cops. - The cops? They already tried to get him and he fucked them up too. - Well what if I helped you huh? If I helped you would you go steady with me? You know what I mean. I could quit using, you could quit selling your body. I mean, I wouldn't have to pay for it anymore. - That's a nice dream. - [Benjamin] Well? - Let's kill this motherfucker. (dark eerie music) (groaning) (crying) - Fuck you. (crying) (suspenseful music) (crying) Fuck. (crying) Dana? What the fuck are you doing to my Dana? (dramatic music) (crying) I love you baby. Don't fucking touch me. - [Dana] I love you. - [Rachel] Don't touch me! (baby crying) (dramatic music) (baby crying) - Hey, what if we ran him over with my car? - No, no, that's not gonna fucking work. Have you seen the size of this fucking thing? It's tiny. He's just gonna destroy it. Okay, I say we just go out there and fucking run up on him. - Okay. (suspenseful music) - Fuck, there he is. - Holy fuck, he's a giant. - He's a fucking rapist killer. (suspenseful music) Bastard! - [Massive] No, no please. - Fuck. - Please. (crying) - I got this. (dramatic music) - Stop, stop he's dead. - God. I think everyone's dead. - Oh my God. There's a baby in here. Oh God it's still breathing. Ben quick, quick I need something to cover it up. Please, anything. Oh my God. - What's that doing here? (baby crying) What's its gender? - I didn't check yet. (baby crying) Guess. - Boy? - Yeah. - I always wanted a boy. - Me too. Can we keep him? - Sure. I mean we just find some more money. Does this mean we're family now? - I think so. We make a pretty great team. Promise me one thing though. We'll never tell the kid what really happened. - A pretty good team. - Let's just say his parents died in a car crash. - Yeah, that's my story and I'm sticking to it. (baby crying) Hey, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon? Tomorrow morning I gotta go into a sperm clinic. Make a donation. (police sirens) (dramatic music)
