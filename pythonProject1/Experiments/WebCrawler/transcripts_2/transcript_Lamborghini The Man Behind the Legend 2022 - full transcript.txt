foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- It's good to be home. She's probably not there. She's there. Don't you want to go home first? After. Suppose she's found someone else. She hasn't. Okay. Hope you're right. I am right. Ferruccio. This one is good. Yeah. Ferruccio! - Ferruccio! Ferruccio! - Ferruccio! - Yes! - Ferruccio! Ferruccio! Stop hugging me! I'm home. I'm not dead! But you're in one piece and we prayed for that. Ferruccio. Careful. It's good. Isn't it? - Fantastic. - Oh! Don't touch it. Okay, miss. Okay. The world has changed. Farming isn't everything anymore. Not in Cento. Not even Italy. We find a place in the city. A little apartment. And a garage. What about the farm? I don't want it, Papa. Give it to them. They've worked for it. I have an idea to start a company. To build tractors. Smaller, cheaper tractors than the ones that are being made now. You're a farmer. You think I was a farmer in the war, Papa? I was a mechanic. I learned about machines, about cars and engines. Did I raise a fool? The only company that sells tractors in Cento is Cugini Randi. Everyone knows that. But they don't have the best tractors. They have the only tractors. If I make a better tractor, for less money, people will buy mine. We have a plan, Papa. We're going to race in the Terra dei Motori. And if we win, when we win, we'll use the prestige to raise the money for the first tractor. - Who is we? - Matteo and me. - Who's Matteo? - My friend. - You have a race car? - We're going to make one. You can make a car? We're buying an old Topolino for nothing. We're redesigning the engine, increasing the displacement. Turning the 500cc into a 650cc. I have also an idea for a new cylinder head, with overhead valves. I can make it with bronze. Cheap, easy. It'll be as fast or faster than any car in the race, Papa. I can do this. I can make the lives of every farmer like you better. With a tractor, you can compete with the big companies. How do you know your tractor will work? We'll make it work. How do you know it'll be cheap? We'll make it cheap. Papa, even the government knows the world has changed. It's helping new companies with loans to rebuild Italy. And if nobody buys your tractors? "A man who's not in debt has no reason to work." How many times have you told me that? It's not impossible what I'm talking about. The sun rises and the sun sets for most men, and they die. But for some, for great men, their name lives on. I want the Lamborghini name to live on. I want the world to never forget my name. Our name. Our name? This one is not good, Ferruccio. You'll throw your life away. But what better way to do it than in search of greatness. Why can't you believe in me? I believe in what I can see. ♪ Every morning, every evening ain't we got fun? ♪ ♪ Not much money oh, but honey ♪ ♪ Ain't we got fun? ♪ ♪ The rent's unpaid, dear ♪ ♪ And we haven't a buck ♪ ♪ But smiles were made, dear for people like us ♪ ♪ In the winter, in the summer ain't we got fun? ♪ ♪ Not much money oh, but honey ♪ ♪ Ain't we got fun? ♪ ♪ The rent's unpaid, dear and we haven't a buck ♪ ♪ But smiles were made, dear for people like us ♪ ♪ In the winter, in the summer don't we have fun? ♪ ♪ Times are bum and getting bummer still we have fun ♪ ♪ There's nothing surer ♪ ♪ The rich get rich and the poor get poorer ♪ ♪ In the meantime in between time ♪ ♪ Ain't we got fun? ♪ Everybody! ♪ Every morning, every evening ain't we got fun? ♪ ♪ Not much money oh, but honey... ♪ Nine, eight, seven, six... - Ferruccio! - ...five, four, three, two, one. - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year.

The great Enzo Ferrari will be delivering the first-place prize to the winner of the Terra dei Motori Mr. Ferrari has parted ways with Alfa Romeo and will bring his own car to Mille Miglia next year: The Ferrari 166 S. Thank you. I'm so proud of this beautiful car, - it's like a dream come true. - What are you doing? Ferrari. He stands like he owns the world. To see my cavallino with my name on my own car, it's beautiful. - He does. - Thank you. And the race is about to begin. Ferruccio, come on! Signor Ferrari will drop the flag. - One... - Okay. ...two... three! We need more speed! Go! Go! Go! Go... go. Go! After the church, there are two lanes. We can overtake them there. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Number two is trying to pass! - Don't let them pass! - Just shut up, Ferruccio! Don't let them pass! Get ahead of him! Get ahead of him! Get ahead of him! Get ahead of him! It's not wide enough! Go! Go! Go! Go! - Take the lane, Matteo! - There's no room! Take the lane before the turn! - We don't have the speed! - We can beat them! - We will never make it! - For God's sake! What are you doing? Are you crazy? Breakfast. Breakfast. - I don't want anything. - Yes, you do. Ferruccio, breakfast. We could've won. We could've won! - We could've died. - You should have died! What is it, huh? What's wrong? We lost the race. Everything we worked for, it's over. It's not that. What are you afraid of? What? There's something wrong with your ears? Yesterday they were fine. What are you afraid of? Nothing. All my fears already came true. Say it. Say it. I'm afraid that I'm not good enough. That I-I did not win the race not because of Matteo, but because I did something wrong, and I don't know what it was. That's what scares me the most. And I don't know what to do next. What if I'm a fake? What if I'm not who I think I am? What happens then? You're not a fake. I believe in you. I believe in every dream you've ever had. And every one of them will come true. You just haven't found a way yet. Eat. What about your rowing machine idea? That was a good one. Nobody needs to lose weight. All the women got skinny during the war. I might need one in... I don't know, eight, nine months. I said I might need a weight loss machine in about nine months. I heard you. I was thinking. She's having a baby, you fool! - Really? - No, I'm joking. Because it's such a good time to do that. It's going to be alright. You'll be a great father. I think we should call him Matteo. Ciao, Papa. You're okay? I'm okay. Huh. Clelia? Yes, everything's fine. You want me to help? You need money? Yes. I'll pay it back. I don't have much. But I'll give you what I have. It's not enough, Papa. I have an idea. It will be hard. But it will work. This time I know it will work. I promise. If you do this, I'll pay it back with interest. Interest? Yes. He mortgaged the farm? You asked him to do this? He's my father. He's a husband to your mother and a father to your brothers. I'll pay it back. That's not the point. It is not his to give you. It is your brothers'. It is their farm. They worked for it. Their whole lives they worked for it. You said it yourself. They deserve it. You don't believe in me? I believe in you, Ferruccio. I believe in you more than you believe in yourself. But we will find another way. This is selfish. You will not put the future of your family in danger. They have their own dreams. I would never let them lose their farm. Things go wrong. No matter your intentions, things go wrong. Don't do this, Ferruccio! No good will come of it, I can feel it. He only gave it to you because you asked him. He gave it to me because he believes in me. No. Because he pities you. Give it back. He won't take it back. I know him. Then you go to the bank yourself, and deposit it in his account. I'll take the next customer. Ferruccio! It's Vito. Vito Rossi! - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. - How've you been? - Good. How's your father? Your brothers? Very good. Everybody's good. Excellent. Have a seat. So, what can I do for you? I'd like to open an account. Of course. In your name, I assume. Ferruccio in what name would you like the account. My name... Ferruccio. Ferruccio Lamborghini. Great. Can I smoke a cigarette? Of course. - Take that... - Okay. Carioca. That's what we call it. - Hm. - Small enough for a farmer to use anywhere, and strong enough for any company to want. With this kind of power, it will take a lot of gasoline. We start with the Morris four-cylinder 1548 cc. Yeah, of course. What we talked about. Here's what we didn't talk about. - Two fuel tanks? - Yes. Oh, fuck. Listen... - we start on gasoline. - Mm-hm. But when the exhaust manifold warms enough, we can cut off the gasoline and release petroleum from this tank. Maybe. The coil would have to be hot enough to vaporize the petroleum before it gets into the carburetor. That's why it'll be a copper coil. So, two types of fuel. One cheap, one expensive. And a copper coil. Exactly. I don't know. Can it work? Of course it can work. - How do you know? - We make it work. - A hybrid? - Mm-hm. That-that's exciting. A hybrid for our Carioca. - Carioca. - Carioca. Ah, fuck! This one. Hm? - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay. So, it's for sale? Make a bid. Keep going. Right. Okay. Is that it? Fuck! Wow. Wow. Alright. Here she comes again. - Different color head band today? - Yes. Good morning. Morning. Oh, she's beautiful. She smiled at you. She said good morning to you. Go say hello. Why should I? Because you like her? Maybe she doesn't like me. You'll never know if you don't talk to her. It's not that hard. You... You go over, you let your mouth move and it says, "Hello." Okay. Ferruccio! Where are you going?! - Hi. - Hi. - Ferruccio. - Annita. Nice to meet you. Okay. Annita, say hello to my friend, Matteo. - Hi. - Hi. What he meant to say is, "Why don't you sit down and join us?" Oh, I can't, I will be late for school. What-what do you study? - Economics. - Oh. And Matteo's the greatest race car driver that the world has ever known. He knows more about engines than anyone else. - Really? - No. Thanks for the pastry. She likes you. Because I talked to her. If you are as good with tractors as you are with women, oh, we are going to be very rich. I only need one woman. Yeah. Me too. Don't give up. We only lose when we give up. Alright? Alright, alright. I love you. More than anything, I love you. I know. - Okay, hold it. Okay. - Okay. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. - Okay? - Yes. Wave, stupid. Okay. Look. Look here. Look. Really? Stop, stop, stop. - Yes, yes. - No, no, no. No, no, no! My God... Okay. He's close, isn't he? Yes. Tomorrow. Don't come home late. Okay? Promise me. I promise. Gianni, I can't be late. Gianni. Hello? She was bleeding, I called the hospital. They took her. Push, Clelia. Push, Clelia. - Okay. - The baby's coming. - He's coming. - Again. It's coming. It's coming. Breathe. Push, Clelia. Good. Breathe and push. Push. She's getting the paper! She's bleeding! Forceps! Ferruccio! Ferruccio! Can I help you? My wife is here! How is Clelia? The baby is fine. It's a beautiful boy. Where is my wife? There was a problem. We weren't able to stop the bleeding. We need to set a date for the baby, for the baptism. Yes. You need to think about other things now. Of course. May the seeds of the fruit be planted with goodwill. And the harvest will be rich. - Ferruccio. - Vito. So sorry about your wife. I have a proposition for you. If I built a tractor half that size but twice as strong, and half the cost to operate, would your bank invest in a thousand of them? Have you built such a tractor? To the future of the Lamborghini tractor. - We did it. - We did it. She should be here with us. - To Clelia. - To Clelia. Look who's here. I'm crazy about her, Ferruccio. I see her face when I close my eyes to sleep, and it's there when I open them to wake. You're in love. I'm in love. Go get her. Tomorrow it may be too late. I have to go. Go? Where are you going? I'm sorry. - Talk to her. - Yeah. Did my friend talk to you? He did. He doesn't catch my eye. You do. But you know that. Give him a chance. Why should I do that? Because he deserves one. So do I. My wife died. I know. What was her name? Clelia. She was beautiful. She was everything. Don't sit. If you do, I will let you. Here's what will happen: I'll only take what you have to give me because I need it. And some day you will hate me for it. No. I won't. Never. You just want more. You always want more. You want me to say I'm sorry? I'm sorry. Where is your shame, Ferruccio? I wanted to say it's Clelia, that her death has changed you, but in my heart I know that is not true. This is who you are. Who you've always been. Toni no needs a mother. So, yes, I took her because I could. Think about what I just said Matteo, because I could. If I didn't take her, someone else would have. I'm sorry, but she was never going to be yours. How can I hurt my friend by taking something that he never had? Don't let this change things, Matteo. I need you. I've always needed you. Clelia knew that. Clelia was the smart one. She said nothing good could come of this, and look what happened. I want 25 percent of the company. The rest is yours. Tre mignon. Due cornetti. One Sacher torte, in its own box. Thank you. Ciao Bella. - Is Annita in the office? - She is. - Red or blue? - Red. - Not blue? - Definitely red. Definitely red. Who screwed up? It wasn't us. Ferruccio! Go see what she wants. Not me. You're a coward. You look beautiful this morning. I'm sorry I had to leave early. Did I mention you look beautiful this morning? Every time you buy pastries it costs us money. Well, take it from my salary. You forget, I own the company. Is that so? Mrs. Giambini called. Who's-who's Giambini? She isn't happy with her tractor? No, she is unhappy with Toni no. She's his teacher. Tesoro, you have to spend more time with him. I give him everything. Yes, you give him money, clothes, cars. But of yourself? That's what he really wants. You know he is as smart as you are, but he's failing. I'll talk to him. My friend Diego has a new exhibit. I hate your friend Diego. We should go, bring Toni no. Spend some time together as a family. Goddamn clutch! Toni no, it never works. What do you think? About what? The boat. It's a present for you. Because I failed all my subjects? - Yes. - What happens next? We get in the boat, you take me out to sea, and throw me overboard? Come. Sit. Sit. Toni no, life is short. When one is young, when one is beautiful, like yourself, there are more important things than grades. Like my mother? Like her. You still miss her, don't you? Yes. Why? Because she was beautiful, like you. Is that why you miss her so much? I miss her so much because she was the kindest and the smartest person I ever met. She understood better than anyone the difference between right and wrong. And for a lot of people that's not so easy. She always did the right thing. She made it look easy. Annita's pretty great, too. She is. If your grades don't improve, I'll buy you a Ferrari. Good day, mate. I'm looking for a job. Any inkling on who I might see? Everyone's gone home. Come back tomorrow. That's a pretty flash motor you're working on there! - Australian? - Nah, Kiwi. - What do you do? - Anything needed for a car. I came here to turn a wrench. I love the Italian motors, mate. Yeah, called in on Maserati, Fiat, Ferrari, they all told me to piss off. What are we working on? Bad clutch. Whoever's been driving that car needs a lesson or three. It's not the driver. It's the clutch. Would that be a matter of opinion? I want to modify the tractor clutch, to use in the Ferrari. In your opinion, what do I have to do? The disc and the plates are pretty much the same. More than enough space to mount it. I'd say you don't have to do a bloody thing, you just put the new clutch in. - I agree. - I'll give a hand. What's your name? Wallace. Bob Wallace. Yours? Ferruccio Lamborghini. You have a-a car? Yeah. You a good driver? Yeah, I'm the best in New Zealand. Oh. What about Italy? If that was a job offer, I'll take it. Come. I think everything that they said is good to do. It's good. Can you tell him? Give him my very best. Signor Ferrari. Just a moment. Good night. Forgive me, if I could have a moment. Ferruccio Lamborghini. How do you do, sir? What can I do for you? If I may, in my opinion, - you make the best cars in the world. - Oh. I have seven of them. One for every day of the week. Well, there should be more days in the week. More buyers like yourself. Nice to meet you. I have a 250 GT Coupé, a Pininfarina. I have a 250 GT Bayoneta. - It's a great car. I like it very much. - Mm-hm. I even bought a 250GT 2+2. All great. But with all my Ferraris, there is a problem. The clutch. They're all bad. Ferruccio Lamborghini. You know who I am? Oh, yes. You make tractors. And air conditioning and heating. Ah. I've got a dinner appointment. Forgive me, but your clutch does not live up to your car. I come as a friend. I'm sure you know this, I'm not the first to point it out. I have a solution. If you'd consider a partnership. Ferrari and Lamborghini. We'll make the best cars in the world. Go back to your tractors, farmer. You're stealing from people. You're charging ten times what it costs me to put a better clutch in my tractors. You know what they say about Lamborghini? That he's too uneducated to understand what he doesn't know. So, not to state the obvious, but he's a prick of the first order. Isn't he? I don't like the way the man talks, don't like the way he dresses, don't like his smile, or lack thereof. You already have the job. It doesn't change the truth of what is. The Miura is the fiercest and most cunning of all bulls. But this matador is the champion. Life and death, Toni no. This is what bullfighting is all about. Some people turn away, others watch and learn. I want the bull to win. Me too. But it doesn't happen often. Toni no, look at the faces of the people. The matador kills the beast, or the beast kills the matador. That moment will live forever in the hearts of the people watching. Why doesn't he run away? Because he is a champion. It's fascinating, isn't it? The bull is everything. So unforgettable. What are you thinking? I'm thinking of a car. A car that doesn't exist yet. One that is as strong and powerful and as unforgettable as the bull. I'm going to build it. A car? Coffee, gentlemen? Hi. Yes, please. - Here you go. - Thank you. I come get you later. Perfect. Have a good day. So, this is my idea. How long will it take? How long? It can't be done. How long do you think it will take? As much as I hate to agree with Mr. Bizzarrini, I think he's right. This? This can't be done. You agree? I actually love what you're asking. It's new and I'll design it. But engineering is their department, if they think it's impossible, who am I to argue? What I can say, I can't design a car if I don't know the specifications, and it's something that needs to be decided. It is decided. It's right here. This is the car to make the world forget about Ferrari. Ferruccio, please. A V12 touring car double camshaft, dry sump lubrication, five speed transmission. A limited slip differential, two ignition coils instead of one? Six twin-choke carburetors. It's impossible to fit all of this in a 3.5 liter engine. No, it must be a 3.5, four liter is too heavy. We need the power but we need the speed, too. The Lamborghini 350 GT has to be as fast as a racing car. The man wants to defy the laws of physics. Are you listening? Either you're a car maker or you are a dreamer, Ferruccio. Please, we all have families here. We all quit our job to come work for you. We all believe in you, we all believe in your ideas but... What if instead of cast-iron we make an aluminum engine? I know you are the new genius in town, but people have been trying this for years. Aluminum can't withstand the heat. What if we keep certain parts cast-iron? The valves, the cylinders, the combustion chamber. That's something new, I don't know if this would work. But we can try it. It could be as much as half the weight of the engine. - At least. - And the engine, maybe we can change it from dry sump to wet sump. I need to build a chassis to accommodate a double camshaft. - Good. - And the carburetors? A rear stabilizer bow would help. Great. Great. And it has to be ready to unveil - in the Geneva Motor Show. - That's very tight. - I think we can do it. - It's 18 months. No, no. Six months. Geneva is March 21st. - Geneva this year? - Yes. - You want to do Geneva in six months? - Oh, yes. Ferruccio, please, you're talking like a madman, seriously. Why would you ask me to design an automobile in six months that doesn't yet have an engine or a chassis? In six months, in Geneva, people will be looking for the next Ferrari. What they will find is the first Lamborghini. The Lamborghini 350 GT. Why are we here? Someone tell me why we're here. - To make a car. - To make the best car! To make the greatest car the world has ever seen. As strong as Hercules, as beautiful as Sofia Loren. It must be ready for Geneva! It's not impossible until we fail. If we fail, we fail searching for greatness. Huh? We need to get Bevini and Pedrazzi for fabrication and assembly. They are brilliant and fast, and everybody wants them. No, we'll get it. We'll have no time to make our own differential or brakes. - We'll have to buy those. - Germany for differentials. - Zahnradfabrik. - England for brakes. Girling. Girling will never deliver in time for Geneva. Leave it to me. Okay? Good? We chase the dream? Okay? - You're all crazy, you know that. - Yes! Isn't it wonderful! Come on. - Cheers. - Yes! No, no, no, no. Not two weeks! One week. - I need the differential in one week. - Grazie. Nobody wants to do anything. Now I have to go Germany and then England after that. I don't think it's wise what you're doing, Ferruccio. You're going to suck every penny out of the tractors, and if it doesn't work, we will lose everything. Please. It will work. But what if it doesn't? Look at what happened to Lancia. The unions will beat them, and Lancia will go under. I take good care of my men, they have no need to strike. The price of petrol keeps going up, and there's talk of nationalizing the energy industry. People will always need to buy tractors. But luxury cars? That is the first thing they'll stop buying. Alright, well, then what about the board of directors? You at least have a responsibility to tell them what you're doing. I talked to them. You went to the board? I knew you would object. No, you know that I am right. But you don't care about me, you don't care about the board, you don't care about your men, you don't even care about your own son. The only thing that matters is the great Lamborghini! What do you want me to do?! You want me to be normal? You want me to be like everyone else? Living on my knees, afraid to make the wrong decision? Making a fool of myself at every turn? Crawling like a crab on the floor of the ocean? I don't know who you thought you married! I married someone who could talk! Not only yell. For that I have bread, and I have a lot. You have already gotten yourself off of the ocean floor. What you're doing could put you back there. You are the only one who doesn't understand, Annita. Everyone loves me. You are the only one. Everyone else thinks I'm great. Who are all these people who think you're so great, Ferruccio? My workers. Huh? My friends. They love you because you pay them. Once they want what you cannot pay they will strike and you will be alone. What is this? CVs for your new secretary. I fired the blonde you're fucking. Good. Coming left. Left. - It's left. - Your left. My left. - Okay? - Okay. I think it's everything we talked about. It's a little extreme. I like it. It's what you asked for. What is this? The headlights. They pop up when you turn on car? - Yes. - Pop up? No, no, no, Franco. No, no, no. It's too complex. We need to make a statement, not a question. The idea is when you look at it, there are no headlights, then when you turn the key, the lids rise and the lights come up. It's innovative. Ferruccio, this is new. It's exciting. And you wanted it to look like a race car. Yes, a race car, fast and powerful, but still a touring car, gran turismo. And look here, this-this bonnet is too big. Bonnet is perfect. Perfect. Franco, it looks like a marshmallow on top of a flounder. Franco. Franco. I'm sorry I'm not good enough for you. Franco, I love you. I hate your design, but I love you. All I'm asking is that you start over. You ask us to be creative, Ferruccio. And this is creative. And you want me to start over. You can't ask me the world and when I give it to you, you tell me you want a different one. I've given you greatness, Ferruccio. Greatness. You've given me a look at something I don't understand. Give me something I understand. It's all I want. The world will be ready for this one day, just not now. The bonnet is too big, the grill too extreme. I like the headlights, I love them! But not for the prototype. Next year we do that. The back is too sharp, it's too sharp. Less contour, more round. Franco. Franco, look at me. You are a great designer. Maybe the greatest. Give me something great. I don't have any more to give, Ferruccio. Ferruccio. Everything good? Nothing is good. The good news is the innovations are going to work; the front and rear suspension's on independent wheels, with double wishbones and stabilizer bars. We'll have the speed and the power. Carburetors are too high. Exactly. We won't be able to close the hood. Obviously, the measurements were off. I take responsibility for it, Ferruccio. But we are working too fast, there's no time to check anything. I take responsibility, not you. So, what do we do? If you want to keep the twin-choke carburetors, we need to create a new design. There's no room to lower them or make them smaller. What if we make them horizontal? I thought of that. There's no room. Then we make room. It's possible, but these things take time, Ferruccio. I can talk to Franco, maybe he can raise the hood, that's an easier fix. What are we going to make a hump like a camel? No, don't think so. We can't redesign, we'd have to make a new engine, we'd never make Geneva. Excuse me, Ferruccio, but wouldn't it be better to miss it than present a car that doesn't deliver on everything we want it to be? Make the carburetors horizontal. You'll find a way. I got a proposition for you, mate. I'd like to be your test driver for this new car of ours. - I need a great one. - You're looking at him. Are all Australians like you? No, Australians would love to be like me, a kiwi. Actually, all kiwis would love to be like me, too. But, nah. I'm a one-off. Ah, she's a beaut, mate. This is what you gave me. I think we're pretty close. I thought the gold might be wrong at first, but... I'm eternally grateful, maestro. It's going to be the greatest car that's ever been made. The Lamborghini 350 GT. We unveil in Geneva. Oh, interview? That's fantastic, tomorrow. Tomorrow is Christmas Eve. No, no, no, no. Tomorrow works. That's great. Fantastic. Ciao. Car enthusiasts all over America are hearing rumors that after dominating in the field of tractors, air conditioning and heating, Lamborghini is gonna be the big news of the upcoming automotive season. This March, at the Geneva Motor Show, I will unveil the first Lamborghini Gran Turismo automobile. Ah, very exciting, of course. But, tell me why you think that the world needs another luxury car. We have the Ferraris, we have the Maseratis, that's nothing to say of our friends in England and Germany. Yes, yes, good cars all. Many of which I own and drive. But it's perfection that I am after. And as great as these cars are, I'm not convinced they are special. Special is drinking your favorite wine for the first time. Special is... losing your virginity. Special is that one thing you never forget. This is what we bring to Geneva. Here, here and here. Great? Great. Beautiful. Well done. Bravo, bravo. We reconfigured the exhaust pipes and moved them closer to the front. We widened the axles an inch on each side. The wheels will be 15 inches instead of 16. We also moved from a standard shifter to a gated shifter which gave us more room. - Enough? - Theoretically. Okay. Let's see if it fits. We have a car. When we are a success in Geneva, they will want to know our next idea. You start thinking about this now. Excuse me? I only have a name, the Miura. Like the bull. It must be the most beautiful car the world has ever seen. Yeah? Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest of honor, the one and only Tony Renis. This one is for my great friend, Ferruccio Lamborghini. The pride of Italy. Maestro. You're Lamborghini? Ferruccio. What are you drawing? An idea. For a car? For the greatest car in the world. Can I see it? Come. What do you see? Lines on a napkin. What do you see? - A dream. - What? - Close your eyes. - Why? Close them. Open them. Now, the headlights on my Miura will have beautiful eyelashes, like yours. Toni no, go wait in the car. Please. Ah, Annita, I've been waiting for you. Let me introduce Gabriella. Please don't. Leave. - Annita, please. - Leave, now! Annita, I'm showing her my sketch. You said once that you would never love me, and that I would hate you for it in the end. But you were wrong. I don't hate you, I feel sorry for you. You have a hole in your heart, and I was wrong to think that I could fill it with all the love in mine. But now I know, you never want to have it filled. And now, neither do I. And what about Toni no? - What about him? - He is my son. Are you asking me to leave him with you? And leave him without the only mother he's ever known? If that is what you're asking, then ask. If you have it in you, then ask. Goodbye, Ferruccio. Where are they? Maybe they had an accident. Maybe you should have an accident. There are so many things we don't know. And this is a prototype not a car. I told him not to push it. We don't know anything. Baby steps! We told him, baby steps! It's everything we want! It should be green. What? - Green, should be green. - Green? But-but this or next one? This, for Geneva, green. - Hm? - Okay. Italy has long been an agricultural society, but post-war Italy has given birth to an industrial Renaissance. Ever wonder how one might create something new in a world of inventive, challenging, and innovative car manufacturers and designers? Well, I'm standing here with somebody who just might be able to have those answers. None other than Ferruccio Lamborghini. Ciao. So, how does somebody like you demonstrate a clear break from tradition and deliver something brand new? The Lamborghini GT is both beautiful and high performing. It's a touring car that is fast and powerful as any racing car. And, can this new car of yours be all of that? Oh, it can be all of that and more. It is a thing of beauty. But a thing of beauty can only be a thing of beauty if it's shared. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the world press, I give you Lamborghini GT! My friends, my friends, I can see in your eyes how you love my car but don't be shy. To drive a Lamborghini, to own a Lamborghini, you must not be shy. Mr. Lamborghini, I know there are many questions about what's under the hood of this car, but my first question is: what is the price tag of the Lamborghini GT? - What is the price of a beautiful woman? - Hm. A great bottle of wine? A pasta you remember the rest of your life? These things are worth whatever they ask you to pay for them. You buy a Ferrari when you want to be someone. You buy a Lamborghini when you are someone. Lamborghini. Bravo, bravo. Strike, strike, strike Lamborghini. Strike, strike, strike Lamborghini. After a decades-long high, everything has come crashing down in a crushing blow to the post-war automobile industry. Severe government restrictions dealt the latest blow to an industry that was already on its knees. The combination of union strikes, and a 300 percent increase in the price of oil, has proven more damaging to Italy than other European industrial nations. Even Ferruccio Lamborghini, who's famous for having personally negotiated his employee contracts, has met his match in the power of the automotive industrial unions. There was a time when Ferruccio was a working man himself, where are you now, Ferruccio? Ferruccio, where are you? Speak up. Are you with the working men and women of this world or aren't you? Where are you, Ferruccio? Where are you now, Ferruccio? Where? Huh? Where? Where are you now? Half the money from the sale of the company will go to you. The rest to my brothers. I put a clause in the contract. They must keep the name Lamborghini forever. How is the family? Good. How old? Girls are three and five. Ferruccio is two. His birthday was last Saturday. Two years old already. I should have been there. Oh, it's okay. The gift was lovely. He loves boats. Plays with it in the tub. Won't take a bath without it. We call him Captain Ferruccio. Have you heard? They've appointed me Cavaliere del Lavoro. That's exciting. Now when I talk to the president I can use the informal "tu". You've done it all. Everything that you ever wanted. Was it worth it, Papa? Toni no... It's okay. I should get home now. Ciao, Papa.
