And I can still remember that you were the most beautiful woman there. I remember, you weren't impressed with the photos I took. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Hey, I liked one. [BOTH LAUGHING] - Ready? - [BOTH LAUGHING] [DAVID] I know I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. You're my love. You're my angel. You're my muse. And I want to spend the rest of my life... the rest of my life being the man worthy of your love. [MEG] Are you sure about this? Of course, very sure. No turning back now. [ROMANTIC MUSIC CONTINUES] I choose you, David. And I will choose you every single day because you are the most passionate and compassionate person I know. I promise to support you 'til the very end of our lives. I'll always be your wife, your best friend, your biggest fan. [CHUCKLES] - [ALL] Cheers! - [CLINK] I love you. I love you forever and ever, babe. [ROMANTIC MUSIC CONTINUES] - [MUSIC FADING] - [PHONE RINGING] - [MAN] Wow! That's great. - [WOMAN CHUCKLES] - It's good! - I must say, your wife is so beautiful, David. - Thanks, Jenny. - It's really nice. I really liked it. I'm so excited, you know. You'll be shooting our wedding! - So happy for you guys! - [CHUCKLES] Sir, excuse me. By the way, this is my assistant Emong. - [COUPLE] Hi! - Good afternoon, sir, ma'am. Excuse. Sir, I just want to remind you of your birthday dinner in Makati. It's getting late. You might get stuck in traffic. Uh, I'm sorry, I have to leave. I have an event to go to. But Emong here will take care of you. - All right? - All right. - "Emong The Man." - Nice to meet you. - Emong. - [WOMAN] Hi. Sir, your coat! - You almost forgot. - Thank you! - And happy birthday! - Thank you! [MAN] Sir, happy birthday. [LAUGHING] [CLEARS THROAT] Everyone, everyone, I have something to say. Now you all know, we were worried about this one. [CHUCKLES] We thought David would follow us into medicine, or go into law like his brother, Oliver. But David has made a big success of himself. From being the most sought-after fashion photographer to becoming a household name in weddings. And I'm so proud of you. [CHUCKLES] Thanks, Dad! Happy birthday to David! [ALL] Happy birthday! [ALL] Cheers! Thanks, Dad! Thank you. - [ALL] Cheers! - [CLINK] - Surprise! [CHUCKLES] - Hey! I thought you have a flight? What are you doing here? Babe, I won't miss this for the world. [MOANS] Wanna get out of here? [PEOPLE LAUGHING] - Where are we going? Babe! - Let's go. - Let's go. - What? - Let's go. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [KANIKA] Excuse us. - [DAVID LAUGHS] I have something for you. Wait, it's your birthday. - Why do I get a gift? - No, babe. Please, - I just have something for you. - [CHUCKLES] - Here. - [GASPS] Wait. Happy Best Wife in the World Day. I just wanna say thank you. Thank you for everything. For being understanding when I come home late. Thank you for... laughing at my jokes even when they're not funny. [BOTH LAUGH] Thank you for the breakfasts in bed. I really love you, you know that. I know and I love you too. [ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING] Hold on. [CHUCKLES] I also have a gift for you. [ROMANTIC MUSIC CONTINUES] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] - Yes! - [EMONG] Yeah, that's nice. Good! Find your light. [DAVID] Let's do more shots, girls! Hold it! [EMONG] Doing great, girls. All right, hold it! - [DAVID] Perfect! - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Boss, we need to wrap up. We still have a wedding. - Okay. Last few shots. - All right! - Yeah! There you go! - [EMONG] Last few shots, girls! Closer, closer. [PRIEST] For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part? - [BRIDE] I do, Father. - Hey. - [PRIEST] May the Lord... - Focus. ...strengthen the love you declared for each other. [ALL CHEERING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] - [MEG] Girl, congrats. - [WOMAN] Hey! Bye. It's your first international flight. - Are you excited? - Super! - Congrats! - Thank you, thank you. Oh, my gosh! He really is handsome! He's the new pilot. Captain Stephen. Too bad, he's married. He's a cutie, right? - Let's go! - [CHUCKLES] Okay. Light up their faces. - [EMONG CLICKS TONGUE] - There we go! Okay. Hold it! Hold it! Okay, wait. Take care of that. Don't leave it out of your sight! Yes, sir. Excuse me. Can you take our photo? Uh, sure. Wait. - Hurry. - [CHUCKLING] Stand here. - Okay. One, two, three! - Smile! - One more. One, two, three! - [WOMEN CHUCKLING] Another one. Get closer. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. - [WOMAN 1] Let me see it. - [WOMAN 2] Here. [EMONG] This is hopeless. Don't we have any close-up shots of the couple? I'm assigned to the guests. I have a few photos of the couple but they're too far. Of all the memory cards, why does it have to be Sir David's, huh? What are we going to do now? The magazine photo shoot? The vows, the kiss! And the bride's big moment! All ruined! Here, you need a memory card for your brain. - Emong, that's enough! - Sir David. I'm really sorry. [OLIVER] Thank you. Take it, David. This is the best offer we can get. Or we can go to court. Ten million? That's too much! I'd have nothing left. Why don't you ask help from Dad? Or better yet, sell your house. [SIGHS] I can't sell the house. That's a gift from Dad. It's up to you, David. I don't know where you'll get the money, but I'm telling you now, take this offer. Babe... If we don't agree with this, you'll piss off the couple even more. They might ask for more. Hi, Ms. Hazel Paras. Yes, it's David Santiago. I was wondering if we're still pushing through with the shoot. Hello? Hi, Ms. Maria Rachel? Deleted photos? No, no. [STUTTERS] It's just... This is blown out of proportion, ma'am. Thanks for letting me know. Sir Alfred? All right. Thank you, sir. [POIGNANT MUSIC PLAYING] [DAVID] Take this. What's that, boss? I'm done. Go ahead. Consider it a loan. [SCOFFS] Take care of that. Yes, boss. If you and your wife ever need anything, don't hesitate to call me, okay? You take care, boss. - You too. - [EMONG] Ma'am. - [KANIKA] Babe... - Is it true? I've lost it? [SIGHS] Babe, it's not true, okay? [SIGHS] Come here. [POIGNANT MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC FADING] [BRIGHT MUSIC PLAYING] I'm glad we're going home early. Yes, I know. My God. - What? - Go ahead. - Okay, bye. - Take care! [CHUCKLES] [MEG] Wow! - Nice bag! So posh. I love it! - [CHUCKLES] Hey, who's he? Uh, he's David's former assistant. That's nice, he's on the cover now. I know, right? [MEG] Hi, Captain! [CHUCKLES] [KEYBOARD CLICKING] [CAR HORN HONKS] - Welcome home, babe! - Hi, babe! - I'm sorry, traffic's so bad. - I missed you! Missed you too. New bag? [STAMMERS] I'll sell this for additional income. - [CHUCKLES] Babe! - Hmm... - [CHUCKLES] - Babe, I'm sweaty. Babe, wait. I'm all sweaty. [KANIKA] Wait. Babe, why does the floor feel sticky? I mopped it earlier. It feels like dry soap. [SIGHS] Uh, Babe? Okay. Uh. Next time you mop, rinse it good. To make sure there are no soap residues. - Okay? - Okay! - Okay. - I'll just redo it later. - Have you eaten? - [SIGHS] Not yet. [KANIKA] Hey, we're having dinner with Emong tonight, okay? I'm sorry you had to travel all that way. - [WOMAN] It's okay. - Boss. Are you okay? Why don't you do their wedding video instead? Why me? I know you can do it. You're good at it. What's the problem? Photography was the only thing I knew I was good at, no matter what my dad said. And every time I succeeded, I felt... I felt home. And then the industry I've loved... shut me out just like that. Maybe it's my fault. It's my own negligence. I should've... I should have backed up the file. Maybe I got too cocky. [SCOFFS] - [DOOR OPENS] - [KANIKA] Babe, what was that? They drove all the way here. You didn't even bother talking to them. This is so embarrassing! I thought we were going to eat out. You're doing it again, you're putting Emong on the spot. And do they really want to hire me or are you begging them to? And what's wrong with that, huh? Excuse me, guys. [SIGHS] Babe. Babe. Babe, I appreciate everything you're doing for me. I really do. It's just I don't want to force myself into something that's not for me. I'm not doing this for myself. I'm doing this for you. Look at you. You haven't had a haircut. You haven't shaved. What's happening to you? You were not like this. That David is gone. So I quit. Really? 'Cause if you really believe that, then I feel sorry for you. [CLOCK TICKING] [SIGHS] [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] - [GASPS] Captain! - [SHUSHES] What are you doing here? [KANIKA MOANING SOFTLY] [SMOOCHES] [MOANS SOFTLY] - Kanika! - [GASPS] - Hey! - [GASPS] [WHIMPERS] It's just a dream. [SIGHS] [BREATHING SHAKILY] Ah, Nika, you're staring into space. Are you okay? I'm okay. Are you sure? Do you have a problem? Did you and David had a fight? No, we're okay. I'm okay. - Sure? - Yeah. Or you and Cap had a fight? - Who's Cap? - Tell us. Captain Stephen. Meg. Don't believe her. You like him, right? We're not doing anything wrong, okay? - Nothing at all. - Oh, so? What's going on? You're having an affair. Of course not! Excuse me! I'm not having an affair. You're having an affair! - I'm not! - You are! An emotional affair, that is. [MEG] See? I told you. I already told her that. But she's still in denial. I told you guys, I'm not having an affair, okay? If you say so. I'm sure I'm not doing anything wrong, right? - [WOMAN OVER PA] Flight PR2... - [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [MEG] Let's grab some coffee first before we leave. - Kanika. - Sure. - Let me help you with that. - [GASPS] Thank you. I would still be sick if you didn't take care of me in Paris. - Remember? - [KANIKA STAMMERS] Of course, I had to take care of you. Who would fly us back home to the Philippines? [CHUCKLES] That's a good point. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [RAIN PATTERING] - [SIGHS] - Wow, it's raining hard. Meg, Kanika, do you guys need a lift? - I can give you a ride. - [STAMMERS] Me? No, don't worry about me. But you can give Kanika a lift. My house is out of the way, it's not convenient. - Are you sure? - Just take care. Go! Careful. - Thank you. - No worries. Let's go. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES] [CAR APPROACHING] - Careful. - Thank you. Here you go. - Bye. - Bye. - Hey. - Hey. [CAR DOOR CLOSES] Let me get that. Your pilot's car is nice. - [DOOR CLOSES] - [DAVID] Babe! Why did he take you home again? Uh, our service van is broken. Again? Where do you get it fixed? Tell them to close shop. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Babe, it's just a joke. You're too serious. I'll just take a shower. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC FADING] [NO AUDIO] [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [TENSE MUSIC SWELLING] [MUSIC STOPS] Babe, your hair looks nice today. Did you get a haircut? - Yeah. - It looks good. Babe. I've been thinking that... you know, it's been a while since the last time we spent quality time together. Just the two of us. No distractions, no stress. We also haven't gone out for dinner in a while. So, there. Do you have plans? You mean later? Yeah. [STAMMERS] Babe, well... Meg and I have accepted... Captain Stephen's dinner invitation tonight. [SCOFFS] But I can ditch that. They'll understand. I'll just let them know. I'll go with you. Hmm? Can I? [STAMMERING] Yes, sure. I'll tell them you're coming. Okay. - You done? - Ah, yeah. [STEPHEN] No, no. What are you talking about? I disagree. Nothing beats the view of a gorgeous sunset over Budapest. Yeah. You know that. You've been there. Well, except maybe the sight of our lovely flight attendants. [CHUCKLES] Looks like you enjoyed dinner. Yeah, babe. Cheat day? I love cheat days. I look forward to it. - [WOMAN] Excuse me, waiter! - [GULPS] - [WAITER] Ah, yes, ma'am? - [CHUCKLES] Imagine eating anything you want. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [OBJECT CLATTERS] You should not have drank so much if you couldn't handle it. What did you say? I said you had too much to drink. You call that driving? Did I get you killed? - [BREAKS] - Answer me! What the hell is your problem? What? Is Stephen hitting on you? - David, what's happening to you? - Don't make this about me! Just answer the fucking question! You were flirting right in front of me. What flirting are you talking about? - We were not... - You were! I saw it! I saw how you were looking at each other! It's like I'm the one who should be embarrassed. As if you're single! You didn't even bother pretending! Even just a bit! Am I right? Tell me! - Let me go! - Am I right? - Tell me I'm right. - Don't touch me! Why can't I fucking touch my wife? Because you're disgusted by me? Is that why you don't want to have sex with me? That's why you're picking on my beard, my haircut. Right? That's why you're dying to sleep with other men! You're dying to do it! You are... You son of a bitch. Just look at yourself. Give me a reason, Kanika. Give me a reason to justify your actions. - No! You're a fucking flirt! - You're a fucking loser. Don't fucking push me! You're a whore! Cause you're a fucking loser! You're a fucking loser. Tell me, David. Who gave up first? Was it me? Because as far as I know, you gave up first. [SOBS] I took care of you for two years. Two years! So don't dump your issues on me! You're so exhausting. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [EMONG] Hey, boss! You okay? [SIGHS] Aren't you going home yet? Okay, I'll leave you here then. I still have a shoot. - Are you okay? - [SCOFFS] You know, why don't you use my ticket and accommodation to Sinilaban Island? It's from a client but I'm too busy to go. - Sinilaban Island? - Yes. That's an exclusive resort. So you can relax. So you can clear your mind. Sure. - [SOFTLY] Thank you. - [CHUCKLES] No problem, boss. Get up, okay? Good morning! There you go! [LAUGHS] [WATER TRICKLING] [THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING] [BOAT ENGINE RUNNING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Welcome to Sin Island, sir. Thanks. Sin Island? Ah, yes. Short for Sinilaban. - This way, please. - Welcome, sir. Drinks? Thank you. [MUSIC FADING] [WAVES CRASHING] [MEDITATION MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTS] [BOTTLES CLINKING] Shit! - [CANS CLATTERING] - [BOTTLES CLINKING] - [CANS CLATTERING] - [BOTTLES CLINKING] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - [WOMAN] Hey! - [GASPS] You ruined my yoga time! Fuck you! [SOFT ROCK INSTRUMENTAL PLAYING] I didn't order that. Who ordered that? I just wanted to say sorry about what happened earlier. I fell asleep on the beach last night and... I'm sorry I disturbed your yoga time. Well, what else can I do? You've seen everything, right? Not everything. Come on! I'm sorry. Tasha, by the way. David. Let's have some shots. Your treat! [TASHA] Waiter! - [BOTH LAUGHING] - [CLINK] When I first saw you, I thought you weren't real. - What? - No, I... I thought I was just imagining things. Honey, everyone thinks I'm a vision whenever they see me. I am so beautiful, they think I'm an apparition of Our Lady. But... I'm no longer a virgin. I'm also a guest here and you're not under a spell. I'm not a fairy nor a mermaid who'll transform and devour you. Unless that's what you want? I'm kidding! Come on, man. But why were you naked on the beach? And why were you drunk on the beach? Oh! My gosh! You have a problem. What happened? Spill it, okay? Someone did me wrong. Who? My wife. Oh! She cheated? - [SCOFFS] Ouch. - Come on! Welcome to the club. You got hurt too? [SIGHS] Getting too comfortable? So, what's your plan? [BLOWS RASPBERRY] I don't know. You know, there's always that one damage that will remain as one. That one sin that will haunt us for the rest of our lives. That's it. You're broken. A part of you has died. And that sin can kill you. Just kidding! Love you! - [CHUCKLES] You love me? - Mm-hmm. Let's do something fun. Come, let's dance. [SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING] [CHUCKLES] [SULTRY MUSIC FADING] Good night, girl. - See you tomorrow. - Good night. See you. [HIP HOP INSTRUMENTAL BEATS PLAYING] Hey! Sorry, I'm late. I've been waiting for ages! Miss, he's here. Welcome to your romantic interlude, Mr. and Mrs. Cabonce. Let's start? [RELAXING MUSIC PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND] Last night, you said you love me. And now, I'm already your husband? That escalated quickly! Miss, can you pour tea on his head? [DAVID CHUCKLES] I'm kidding. You know, I've made this reservation for me and my husband a while back. Had I known he'd cheat on me, I wouldn't have spent for this vacation. Sorry. It's okay. [CHUCKLES] [EXHALES] [CLEARS THROAT] [SCOFFS] Hey, don't take this the wrong way. My slutty self is not for everyone. I don't let just anybody experience this. Just so you know, I only give my slutty self to the man I love. I've no plans of sleeping with you, trust me. And we will never be like our partners, right? I wasn't saying anything. Well, I just want to be clear, to avoid any tension. Is there any? Is that a challenge? We will never be like our partners, right? Your turn. [CLEARS THROAT] Never. Very good! - Cheers! - Cheers! - [CHUCKLES] - [GLASSES CLINK] What's up? Uh... Can you... fix the tripod? What's this for? Instagram? Facebook? Uh, this is for my online portfolio. I'm a swimsuit designer and this is my collection. You like it? It's not ideal to shoot at this time. The sun is too bright. Your photos will be overexposed for sure. Try the magic hour, so you can play with lighting. Your photos will be more dramatic. You talk too much and it's not helping. Are you a photographer? Hobby or by profession? I did some... some freelance magazine covers. Covered mostly weddings. What happened? You failed? Things fucked up. You're always playing the victim! Maybe you just weren't good enough. Maybe. That's why everyone left me. I think my wife is leaving me too. So it's true? You're a failure. Maybe you really are a loser? Fine! I'm a loser! Hey. Are you still mad at me? Sorry. I was just kidding. Sorry. I'm sorry, too. There you go! We're good, right? Help me then. Please, be my photographer. Come on, please. Help me. [SIGHS] There you go! You look better when you don't play the victim. - Look at that smile! - Come on. [CHUCKLES] - Let's go. - [GIGGLES] Stephen! It's sad when couples break up. Why? [CHUCKLES] Well, like you and your wife, right? It's just sad to think that... there are people who give up on each other, despite their love. I don't know. Sometimes it's just not meant to be. Like me and my wife. Or should I say ex-wife? We were meant to be with other people. That's it. We acknowledged that and... we chose not to suffer anymore. And it's a good thing. 'Cause now, I'm free. And... ready to make that commitment with the right person. You love me, right? [LAUGHS] Come on, Stephen, I'm married. [SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING] [STEPHEN] I love you. Kanika, I love you. [KANIKA] Stephen. [STEPHEN]Why are you speechless? Because it's true? Because you think of me at night? Or is it because... whenever you sleep beside your husband, you long for me. [STEPHEN]Don't you ever wonder... what my soft, round lips taste like? Please, excuse me, okay? I have to go to the restroom. Sorry. Sorry. [EXHALES] [TASHA LAUGHS] [BOTH PANTING] [SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTS, MOANS] [BREATHES HEAVILY] - [SNIFFS SHARPLY] - [BREATHES HEAVILY] [BOTH PANTING] What's wrong? I can't... I can't... I can't do this. No, no, wait. [EXHALES] What? ["COMATA SILVA" BY MOOPHS FEAT.

That looks delicious. Of course, I'm delicious. [BOTH CHUCKLE] It's been a while since somebody served me breakfast in bed. Gosh. It's no big deal. All right. If you could have anything in this world, what would it be? I've always wanted a... Super 8 camera when I was a kid. It's always been my dream camera.

He's staying at the Lilac villa. - I'll take you there. - Please, thank you. [MOANS] - Kanika? - [GASPS] - Babe! - Hey. [BREATHES DEEPLY] Surprise! Emong told me you're here. I might take a short sabbatical. It's not anytime soon but I've talked with my department head and I think she'll approve. [SIGHS] That's... David! Oh. Hi, David! Did I disturb you? I'm Tasha. My villa's just a few blocks away. You must be Kanika. Your wife. Oh, anyways, David, I left something inside. So I'll just check it. Okay? [SIGHS] Found it! Am I bothering you? Sorry, I guess my panties walked here all by itself. Bye! [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [BREATHES HEAVILY] - [YELLS] - [BREAKS] [SCREAMS, PANTS] Babe, don't do this. Don't... Don't be like this. Did you fuck her? Yes. [SOBS] You son of a bitch! You pig! Son of a bitch! Fuck you, David! - You son of a bitch! - Kanika! [SOBBING] Kanika, I was lonely. [SNIFFLES] I was angry, I... I don't know... Okay, I'm... I'm sorry. I never had sex with Stephen. But you wanted to? You're attracted to him? Yes. [WHISPERS] Yes. [SIGHS] I saw that. Is that why you did it? That's why I got hurt. Are you justifying what you did? I'm not justifying what I did, Kanika. But when did I start being lonely? When you stopped being my wife. Didn't it all start when you gave up on yourself? I tried, okay? It's hard. [SOBS] Okay, you always say that... [SNIFFLES] You always say that you're there for me. [SNIFFLES] You always say that you believe in me. But your eyes say otherwise. Shut up. David, shut up! So the world is ganging up on you again? So you're the poor victim again? David, when will you ever admit that you were wrong? That this time, it's your fault? When will you admit that your ego is also to blame? Yes, I was tempted! And I'm sorry. [SOBS] But, David... David, I didn't give in. I came to my senses. Not just because we're married. But because I love you. I can't do this anymore. Kanika, stop. Stop, please. [SNIFFLES] Please, I'm sorry. It was just sex. This isn't about that woman, David. This is about you and me. And whether we can set aside our issues and our egos to save what's left of our marriage. - Please, stop. - Let me go! [JOBELLE]But, you see, the thing is... I'm sorry, I'm telling you this as a friend and I'm just being honest. You committed a grievous sin. Because if your feelings were involved, as opposed to David who just wanted sex... Well, you know how men are. Lust is just lust, nothing more. Is that an excuse, Jobelle? Really? No! I'm not justifying my actions. It wouldn't have come to that if she didn't flirt with that fucking pilot! Now, I feel guilty. I wouldn't have sent you to that island if I knew this would happen. And we can't blame David for going to that island to lick his wounds. Even men who have no problems with their wives, if they feel chained, they would roam. What more your husband? Nika. You're married to him. Then he finds out you're attracted to another man? [SCOFFS] Of course, his ego will be crushed. So David's the victim again? And it's Kanika's fault again? [SCOFFS] You know what his excuses are. "Oh, I'm lonely, I'm depressed." But Kanika has to suffer in silence again? There's no point debating who committed the greater sin because... The point is you both sinned. What will you do after everything that happened? Because you can't punish each other forever. So in that case... you're going separate ways? [SIGHS] No. I love my wife. [WEEPS] I love my husband. [SOBBING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Oh. David. Sorry, the door is open. Oh, it's always open. I have cameras everywhere. So, what brings you here? I just wanted to say sorry. Sorry for what happened in the island. And I just want to say it's not my intention to... you know, to use you or lure you... David, stop right there. Um... It's done. It already happened. At least, we had fun! Yeah. Yeah, I just... I just feel the need to start over. How are you and your wife? I choose to fix our marriage. I realized I still love my wife. Well, I'm happy for you. By the way, I patched things up with my husband. So you're not the only one! - That's good. That's nice. - Yeah! So, friends? Ah... Why? Just friends, right? Oh... Friends. Okay. [NERVOUS CHUCKLE] All right. Okay. I... I gotta go. Thank you. It's okay. Bye. See you. [WOMAN] You spent it on the races again, didn't you? When will you ever change? [MAN] Why? Look who's talking! I have sacrificed so much for this family! - Haven't I done the same? - And you say that! [WOMAN] Gambling addict! [MAN] I'm a gambler! And you're a nagger! [WOMAN] Liar! Thief! [MAN] At least, in gambling, I have a chance of winning. - But not with you! - [DOOR SLAMS] Don't you ever get tired of fighting with Mom everyday? I guess we can't live without screaming at each other. At least, once a day. Can't things ever change between you? Oh, well, we can change things. Maybe we'll kill each other tomorrow instead. [LAUGHS] Dear... I'm just kidding, come on. I know why you're here. You and David had a fight. There's no such thing as forever anymore, you know. Because forever love is something you fight for every day. Even if it hurts. Even if it's hard. Because forever is only for the brave. And we raised you to be brave. [RAIN PATTERING] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] I love you. Babe, I'm so sorry. I love you. - Welcome back! - [LAUGHS] - Hi, David! - [CHUCKLES] - Are you going home? - I miss you. I love you. - I'll miss you. - I'll miss you, too. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [KEYBOARD CLICKING] [KEYBOARD CLICKING] - Can you wrap it, please? - Sure, ma'am. [YOGA INSTRUCTOR] Forget all your worries and think of your happy place. Okay. Inhale. Look up. Slowly twist to the left side. Inhale. - Exhale. - [LAUGHS] [EXHALES] Sorry. - [SCOFFS] - [YOGA INSTRUCTOR] Okay, inhale. Left hand reaches up. - Now, inhale positivity. - [INHALES] - Exhale negativity. - [EXHALES] Hi! [CHUCKLES] - Do you mind? - [STONES SIZZLING] No, it's okay! [STONES SIZZLE] [EXHALES] It doesn't feel hot enough. [STONES SIZZLE] Too hot? You know, if you can't handle the heat, you can get out of the kitchen. David and I are just going through a rough time. Sorry if you got caught in the mess. But we are already working on our marriage. We're already fixing things. So I hope that you'll leave us alone. You mean, David has forgiven you for cheating on him? Look. [SIGHS] Maybe you two found a connection back in the island. He might've said things that you believed right away. Maybe... he made you believe that this could be something more than just sex. But believe me... this is nothing more than just sex. I am begging you... woman to woman, one human being to another, don't you ever bother us again. What if I don't want to stop? Then I will kill you. [SCOFFS, CHUCKLES] Have you ever killed anyone? [SIZZLING] If you can't take the heat, then get out of the kitchen. [DOOR OPENS] [WOMAN] Ow! Why is it too hot in here? - [DOOR CLOSES] - [LADLE THUDS] - [KANIKA] Babe! - Babe! Thank you. Oh, man! Thank you! Thank you for the gift! I've always wanted that. That's not from me. [WHISPERS] Hey. I got this for you. [SOBBING] [OPERATOR] The subscriber cannot be reached. Please try again later. Tasha! - [GLASS BREAKING] - [TASHA CRYING] Tasha? Please, stop it! [SOBBING] Tasha, what happened? [TASHA SOBBING] - Wait! - Don't leave me! Don't leave me! What happened here? What happened to you? I thought we were patching things up. Yesterday, he was so sweet. And then earlier... he started beating me up for no reason. After this, you have to go to the police. You have to report this. No, David. Can you please stay? Please. I'm scared. I can't stay. [STAMMERS] No, my wife... David, as a friend. I already called my dad and he's on his way. Okay. I'll stay until your dad gets here. Thank you, David. [SIGHS] [WOMAN] Come with me for a while. - Where do you wanna go anyway? - To the bar. Bar? Yeah. - Kanika, do you wanna join us? - Uh... You go ahead. - Okay. - I'll be right there. She said she'll be right along. - Thank you. - Thank you too. - Take care! - Sure. [TATTOO MACHINE WHIRRING] Uh, you're Tasha's husband, right? And you're the wife of her new victim? What? I saw your husband earlier. But only for a while. My wife and I had a fight. I was there to talk to her. You filed for an annulment? Francis, we both know we're over. [SCOFFS] What the hell is this? Huh? You want me to admit that I have psychological incapacity? - So you can leave me? - [CHUCKLES] Tasha, you're the one who's crazy, not me! She gets jealous of everybody. Everybody! See this? Hm? She did that. [SCOFFS] She did it while I was sleeping because a certain "Ashley" was calling me. Do you want to know who Ashley is? - Yo, Ashley! - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Boss? That's Ashley. [CHUCKLES] It's okay, bro. Thanks. Well, anyway, I assume that's why you're here so that you know what you're up against. - [PHONE RINGING] - [SCOFFS] I can tell you she's no ordinary woman. She's fucking crazy. You're going to leave me, or I'm going to kill you? You know, go ahead. Just kill me. I prefer that over you leaving me forever or worse, see you with another man. How are you even gonna kill me, Tasha? Huh? Death by orgasm? [DAVID] Tasha! What the hell are you doing? Now, she's got her eye on your husband. And you know what? Once you've tasted her, there's no going back. I'm crazy about her. And I wouldn't be surprised if your husband goes crazy over her too. - [BREAKS] - [SCREAMS, CRIES] Francis, don't! - [DAVID] Tasha! - [TASHA] Don't! [TASHA WHIMPERS] Maybe... my husband's stronger than you are. Where is your husband right now? [TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] What the fuck? David, don't you miss this? Come on, please. Don't you miss me? Don't you miss this? Come on! - You're fucking crazy! - [TASHA GASPS] Stay the fuck away from me! Stay away from us! David, come back here! David! David! [PANTS] [GRUNTS] [LINE RINGS] Oliver? Our firm has handled two, three cases against that woman. Several lawsuits have been filed against her. And what? Nothing came out of them because she is formidable. She has a battery of lawyers to get her out from any trouble. Do you know that we have cases stalled because of her? - [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] - [CUFFS RATTLING] I knew you couldn't stay away. Can you help me file a restraining order? Yeah, that's possible. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [OLIVER] That girl is trouble. She can destroy everyone and everything around her. [CUFFS RATTLING] [WHIRRING] - [GASPS] - [GROANS] [LAUGHS] [MUFFLED SCREAMING] [GROANING] - [GROANS] - [GUSHES] And she can get away with it. I think it's going to be a long night, David. - [SPOON CLINKING] - [BOWL THUDS] [PHONE CHIMES] [CELL PHONE CLATTERS] [WATER GURGLING] [SOBS] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [CRACKS] What's wrong? No. No. No. I pushed her away. Babe, you believe me, right? [STAMMERS] I don't know anymore, David. I don't know. Babe. I love you. I already talked to my brother. He'll file a restraining order. For now, let's go away. Let's go to Canada. Babe, please give me another chance. One chance to make it up to you. Babe, you have to trust me. Fuck. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] - There's nothing... - Let me see. It's been edited. And it looks like David is sleeping. Did they have sex? What else, she's already on top of him. What's next? They played rock, paper, scissors? I mean, I get it but... [CLICKS TONGUE] I'm not taking David's side, okay? But... something is really off. There really is. You know, girl, if it were me, if I really want to prove to you that I had sex with your husband, I wouldn't send a video of us just kissing. Shouldn't she send a video of them actually having sex? [MEG] Talk some sense into your friend. - Tell her that... - It's true. I told you something's off. Come on. Hey, stop watching that. - [CAR STARTS] - [HONKS] - [TIRES SCREECHING] - [SCREAMS] [JOBELLE] Kanika! Oops! Sorry! - Kanika, are you okay? - Hey, are you okay? Come on, let's go. Fuck you! [ALARM CHIRPS] - [TIRES SCREECHING] - [GASPS] [KANIKA] You! - I tried to talk sense into you! - Let me go! I talked to you straight. But you just want to play stupid games! [GRUNTS] - Enough! - Slap her! Let me go! - Stop it! Ouch! - [KANIKA] Stop? Enough! - You want me to go faster? - [TASHA] It hurts! [TASHA SCREAMS] Stop it! Ouch! Let me go! Ouch! [TASHA PANTING] [KANIKA] You shameless bitch! Enough! Let me go! What are you doing? Don't rip my clothes off! - [CLOTHES RIPPING] - [GRUNTS, SCREAMS] [TIRES SCREECHING] Oops! Sorry. [CHUCKLES] What are you all looking at? [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] - [PHONE RINGING] - [MAN] Cheers, guys! - [HOST] Table 12... - [GUESTS] Cheers! [PHONE RINGING] - Boss. - What? - Is it okay if I take this call? - Yeah, go ahead. - Thanks. - [PHONE BEEPS] Hello? Babe. Where are you? I've been trying to call you. Babe, I'm home now. Babe... I've decided to go with you to Canada. [CLICKS] [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [KANIKA] I believe you. I trust you. And Tasha's not gonna bother us anymore. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] What do you mean? [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [CHUCKLES] Let's just talk about it when you get home. I miss you. I love you. I'm coming home. [DOOR CREAKS] Bye. [YELLS] [DOOR CREAKS] [CLICKS] [FOOTSTEPS] Oh, hi, David. - How do I look? - [SOBS] Don't I look better than her? Put the gun down. Wasn't I the one who brought your passion back? [WHIMPERS] Tasha, can you please put the gun down? - Answer me. - Please calm down. Why don't I just kill her so we can be together? [SOBS] David, I love you so much, you know. - You love me, don't you? - Tasha, have you lost your mind? Say it! Tell her you love me. Say that you love me! [SOBS] - Say it! - [GUNSHOT] - [GROANS] - [GASPS] [MUFFLED SCREAM] David! Are you okay? I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! [KANIKA GRUNTS] - [TASHA] David. David. - [GRUNTING] - You bitch! [GRUNTS] - [CLATTERS] - [GRUNTING] - [SCREAMING] - [TASHA GRUNTS] - [KANIKA] Die, bitch! [TASHA SCREAMS] - [KANIKA GROANS] - [KNIFE CLINKS] [BOTH GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] I'll destroy your face! - [GRUNTS] - [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] - [KANIKA GRUNTS] - [SCREAMS] [BOTH SCREAMING] I'm going to kill you! [BOTH GRUNTING] [KANIKA GROANING] You bitch! [KANIKA] Fucking mistress! - [KNIFE CLINKS] - [BOTH GROANING] [KANIKA SCREAMING] - [GROANING] - [SCREAMING] You piece of shit! You didn't deserve David. [KANIKA SCREAMING] - [DAVID GRUNTS] - David. David. - Crazy bitch! - [SCREAMS] - [KNIFE CLATTERS] - [BODY THUDS] [PANTING] [DAVID] Kanika! Are you hurt? - You okay? - [PANTING] - Babe. Babe, are you okay? - I'm fine. Are you hurt?
