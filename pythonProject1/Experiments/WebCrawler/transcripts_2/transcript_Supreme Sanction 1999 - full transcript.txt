A VERITABLE MEDIA CIRCUS. AND THE LOCAL POLICE HAVE A DESCRIPTION OF A WOMAN WHO APPEARS WOULD BE QUITE ADEPT WITH FIRE ARMS. SURE IT'S JUST AN OVERSIGHT ON YOUR PART, BUT MAYBE YOU MISSED THE MEMO WHEREBY I GAVE THE ORDER THAT SHE BE TERMINATED THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE CONVENIENCE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO. I WAS TRYING TO FOLLOW THAT ORDER. WELL, YOU'VE LOST ME. BECAUSE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE ORDER NOT FOLLOWED, BUT THAT SHE WAS GIVEN AN ASSIGNMENT UPON WHICH THE VERY SURVIVAL OF THIS ORGANIZATION DEPENDS. WE HAD A PLAN TO TERMINATE HER AFTER SHE COMPLETED THE SANCTION ON MCNAMARA. SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE MISSING THE GODDAMN POINT, MR. DALTON. MY PROBLEM WAS SHE WAS GIVEN THE ASSIGNMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT WAS A 950 YARD SHOT. NOW, SHE TOOK OUT MEDIVIC IN SARAJEVO AT 1,175. I DIDN'T HEAR ANY COMPLAINTS THEN. I PICKED THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB. LET'S NOT HORSESHIT AROUND.

JUST THIS MORNING I WAS SAYING I HAVEN'T BEEN SHOT AT ENOUGH LATELY, REALLY GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. DIDN'T LOOK THAT WAY TO ME. WHAT ? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? THE BEACH. THIS MORNING WITH YOUR DAUGHTER. WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? THE MAN BACK THERE, HE DIDN'T LOOK FAMILIAR ? WHY SHOULD HE ? THAT'S RIGHT. HE WAS THERE TO KILL ME WITH MY DAUGHTER ? HE WAS THERE AS A SPOTTER FOR A SNIPER. HOW DO YOU KNOW ? THERE'S THE ROAD, C'MON. WE'RE IN LUCK. I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOUR TRUCK BACK THERE. IT WAS. WHO'S IS THIS THEN ? I DON'T KNOW, PROBABLY SOME HIKERS. YOU GONNA ANSWER MY QUESTION ? UNTIL THIS MORNING I USED TO WORK FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AFTER YOU. AND WHO ARE THEY ? AN ELITE C.T. UNIT. ULTRA BLACK, CALLED ALPHA SECTION. C.T. ? COUNTER TERRORIST ? ( alarm ) WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? WE NEED A CAR. EXCUSE ME. SOMEONE'S GONNA HEAR THIS AND CALL THE POLICE. HOLD THAT. YOU ALWAYS CALL 911 WHEN YOU HEAR A CAR ALARM GO OFF ? WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE C.T. ? I WAS A SPECIALIST IN EXECUTIVE OPERATIONS. YOU'RE AN ASSASSIN. JESUS CHRIST. YOU DIDN'T SHOOT ME. WHAT STOPPED YOU ? GET IN THE GODDAMN CAR. NO, I'M NOT GETTING IN THE CAR WITH A-- GET IN THE GODDAMN CAR ! ( gunshots ) GET IN THE GODDAMN CAR ! YOU DON'T LISTEN VERY WELL, DO YOU ? SHIT ! YEAH, THIS IS DALTON HERE. ( male ) Go ahead, Dalton. I NEED AN AIR UNIT. Copy that, got a 20 ? BLACK CANYON. THIS IS NOT HAPPENING. DENIAL, THAT'S A GOOD SIGN. HEALTHY. THIS IS ABOUT THE THOMAS ETELAND MURDER. HE WAS KILLED FOR WHAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE ARMY HELICOPTER INCIDENT IN ARIZONA. IS THAT IT ? ETELAND KNEW SOMETHING ? LAST SUMMER, THE ARMY HELICOPTERS THAT WERE SHOT DOWN BY THE SUPPOSED MILITIA GROUP. ETELAND HEADED THE ARMY INVESTIGATION. I NOTICED STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING FROM THE DAY HE WAS ASSIGNED TO THE CASE. STRANGE ? HE CAME ACROSS EVIDENCE THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A GOVERNMENT COVER-UP. WHAT KIND OF EVIDENCE ? KEY PIECES OF THE WRECKAGE THAT HAD BEEN LOGGED IN JUST DISAPPEARED. SO HE WENT BACK OUT TO THE CRASH SIGHT. HE FOUND A PIECE OF THE SO-CALLED, "MILITIA CHOPPER" THAT HE COULD I.D. THAT CHOPPER HAD BEEN DELIVERED BACK IN 1985, STRAIGHT FROM THE FACTORY TO A COMPANY CALLED TRITON LTD. INTERNATIONAL. ABOUT WHICH I'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND EXACTLY ZERO. THE F.A.A. RECORDS SHOW THAT THIS CHOPPER CRASHED IN 1994, AFTER IT WAS SOLD TO A GUY WITH ASSOCIATIONS TO AN ARIZONA MILITIA GROUP. BUT THIS GUY HAD BEEN KILLED LATER IN AN A.T.F. RAID THAT WENT AWRY. SO, HE COULDN'T BE QUESTIONED. IT'S CONVENIENT AND JUST A LITTLE STRANGE. NOT WHEN YOU MENTION TRITON INTERNATIONAL, NOTHING SOUNDS STRANGE. YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE ? THEY'RE THE FRONT FOR ALPHA SECTION. SO ETELAND, HE WAS FORCED OFF THE CASE ? TECHNICALLY, HE QUIT JUST BEFORE HE WENT TO HIS SUPERIORS WITH HIS EVIDENCE. HE WAS VISITED BY A GROUP OF MEN WHO SAID IF HE AND HIS FAMILY WANTED TO CONTINUE TO ENJOY GOOD HEALTH, THEY SHOULD STICK TO EVIDENCE THAT POINTED TO MILITIA INVOLVEMENT. "DOMESTIC TERRORISM" WAS THEIR PHRASE. SO, THAT'S THE GAME. THE GAME ? DOMESTIC TERRORISM. ALPHA'S OPERATIONS OVERSEAS HAD BEEN VIRTUALLY SHUT DOWN. ALL WET-OPS HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED. ASSASSINATIONS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT'S LIKE ORDERING TELEVISION NOT TO RUN COMMERCIALS. SO, WE'VE CHANGED OUR FOCUS TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM. THAT'S THE FBI'S TURF. EXACTLY. IT'S A PRETTY CHOICE PIECE. THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW THAT THE FBI CAN'T HANDLE IT ALONE. SO, THEY'VE CREATED A THREAT WHERE THERE WAS NONE. SO ALPHA SECTION, A U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY, KILLED AMERICAN SOLDIERS TO JUSTIFY THEIR EXISTENCE AND THEN KILLED ANOTHER SOLDIER JUST TO COVER IT UP ? WELCOME TO THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. ( door buzzer ) WHO IS IT ? ( Jenna ) It's us. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED ? I WAS GETTING WORRIED. PIECE OF CAKE. WE BROUGHT YOU A NEW CAR. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OLD ONE ? YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW. AHEM ! AHEM ! SINCE YOU'RE GONNA BE SO RUDE AS TO NOT INTRODUCE US, I'M MARCUS. JORDAN MCNAMARA. AS SEEN ON TV. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU AND ALL, BUT YOU GOTTA FORGIVE ME, I DON'T WATCH A LOT OF TV. I FEEL IT'S THE BLAND-- LEADING THE BLAND, I'VE HEARD 'EM ALL. BELIEVE ME. WHAT'S THIS ? IT'S NICE. OH, THAT'S SOMETHING I'M-- YEAH, SURE, GO RIGHT AHEAD, PUT IT ON. NEVER REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT THE PROPER JEWELRY WAS IN YOUR LINE OF WORK. THIS IS NO ORDINARY PIECE OF JEWELRY, MR. MCNAMARA. WAVE TO THE LADY. FIBER-OPTIC CABLES. MICRO-TRANSMITTER, BROADCAST RANGE, A MILE. PICTURE AND SOUND. WHAT DO YOU THINK ? WORKS FOR ME. WORKS FOR YOU. TWO HOURS AGO, I WAS FUCKING FABULOUS. IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY, ASK HIM. IT HAS. WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN EXACTLY HERE EATING BONBONS, YOU KNOW. LISTEN, I WANTED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. COULD I-- SHE WANTS TO ASK ME A FAVOR. SHE WANTS TO ASK ME A FAVOR. I WANTED TO KNOW IF I COULD USE THE SHOWER, OKAY ? SURE, BABY. MI CASA ES SU CASA. THANKS. AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT... YOU SHOULD TAKE A NAP 'CAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT. YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE WITH A KIND WORD, AREN'T YA ? NO, HON, I'M ALWAYS HERE. GOT THAT ? THE INVISIBLE MAN. THIS GUY CRACKED IN THE DEPARTMENT DEFENSE, NORAD, FUJIMOTO BANK, NOT TO MENTION THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU KNOW HIM ? NO, LET'S JUST SAY I'M A FAN. YOU KNOW HIS NAME ? NO. HENCE THE NAME, THE INVISIBLE MAN. WHY ? I DID A STORY ON HIM. BACK BEFORE I BECAME A RICH AND FAMOUS NEWS READER, BUT HE'S JUST A FASCINATING CHARACTER. A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT SO. RATINGS WENT THROUGH THE ROOF ON THAT STORY. HEY, THAT STORY WAS ONE GROSS INACCURACY AFTER ANOTHER. THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WATCH TV. WELL, YOU KNOW, PBS AND WHATNOT. I'M ON WWZN. YOU KNOW, I SOMETIMES LEAVE IT ON IN THE BACKGROUND. COME HERE FOR A SECOND. OH. NOW THAT IS ONE HELL OF A WOMAN. TAKE IT OFF FOR DADDY. YOU SHOULD SEE THAT WOMAN WITH A HANDGUN. I HAVE, BELIEVE-YOU-ME. HMM... DAMN. I GUESS SHE TOLD ME. I'M HUNGRY, I'M GONNA GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT. WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU DO FOR HER ? WELL, A WOMAN IN HER LINE OF WORK SOMETIMES REQUIRES CERTAIN ITEMS THAT CAN'T BE FOUND IN STORES. AND REQUIRE CERTAIN SERVICES THAT AREN'T IN THE YELLOW PAGES, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING ? PICK. I DON'T LIKE CHINESE. WELL, SHE DOES. SO, GUESS WHAT ? KUNG PO CHICKEN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR HER NOW ? WELL, LAST WEEK SHE CAME IN AND SHE WANTED TO BECOME, SHALL WE SAY, LIKE THE INVISIBLE MAN. SHE WANTS TO DISAPPEAR ? THAT'S RIGHT AND I MADE IT POSSIBLE. WAIT, WAIT. THIS WAS LAST WEEK. YEAH, WELL, SEE... WHATEVER HAPPENED THAT DAY, IT MADE HER WANT OUT. AND THE PEOPLE SHE WORKS FOR, YOU JUST CAN'T GIVE YOUR TWO WEEKS NOTICE AND BE ON YOUR MERRY WAY. IT TOOK A LOT OF PLANNING. NOW, SHE WANTS TO GIVE IT UP ALL FOR YOUR SORRY ASS. I DIDN'T ASK FOR HER HELP. BUT YOU CERTAINLY ARE GLAD YOU GOT IT, AREN'T YOU ? TELL THEM IT'S FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION. TELL THEM THERE'S BEEN A THREAT ON THEIR LIVES, BUT DON'T TOUCH ANYBODY UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM ME, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ? OKAY, HOLD ON. WHAT THE FUCK IS MCNAMARA'S WIFE ? WHAT'S HER MAIDEN NAME ? UM... ROSE DANIELS. HER MOTHER. MMM-HMM. ROSE DANIELS. ROSE DANIELS. CONNECT ME. HELLO, ROSE... HOW OLD ARE YOU GUYS NOW, TWELVE ? WHERE'S MARCUS ? HE WENT TO GET CHINESE FOOD. HE'S FULL OF GOOD IDEAS. HE'S A BIG FAN OF YOURS, TOO. WHAT ? ETELAND. THAT WAS YOU, WASN'T IT ? IT WAS A BLIND HIT. THEY GIVE ME A CALL, A LOCATION. THE MINUTE I ARRIVE THEY GIVE ME A TARGET. AND THAT DAY IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE HIM. JUST LIKE THAT ? YEAH, JUST LIKE THAT. I GUESS I SHOULD BE REAL HAPPY YOU GOT AN ATTACK OF CONSCIENCE FOR MY... SANCTION. YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELF. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO HE WAS UNTIL THE NEXT DAY. SAW THE TV REPORTS. THE NEWS. I EVEN SAW YOUR PIECE ON HIM. I'M JUST NEVER GONNA FORGET THE LOOK ON HIS WIFE'S FACE. IT'S NOT WHAT I GOT INTO THIS FOR. WHAT DID YOU GET INTO IT FOR ? I THOUGHT IT WAS BETTER THAN BEING FOUND DEAD OF UNKNOWN CAUSES. THEY THREATENED YOU ? WELL, THEY HAVE A MORE OBLIQUE WAY OF SAYING IT. THEY CHOSE ME. SO, YOU WERE JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS, IS THAT IT ? FUCK THIS. I'M SORRY. I'M NOT USED TO... THIS IS ALL JUST A LITTLE OVER... I GUESS I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HANDLE THIS. WHO SAYS I DO ? YOU EVER... FEEL GUILTY ? EVERY GODDAMN DAY. FOR A WHILE THERE, I THOUGHT I WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE. AND NOW ? WHAT CHANGED ? THE DIRECTOR ALTERED OUR MISSION. INSTITUTED DIRECTIVE SEVEN. WHAT WAS THAT ? LET'S SAY IT'S STRESS PREEMPTION OVER RETALIATION. IF THEY ASSASSINATED PEOPLE WHO... WHO WERE KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED WITH CERTAIN TERRORISTS GROUPS IN PLACES LIKE IRAQ, SERIA, FORMER YUGOSLAVIA. BUT THEY HADN'T ACTUALLY DONE ANYTHING ? POTENTIALS. ISN'T THAT OUTRIGHT MURDER ? WHAT WOULD YOU NEED TO BREAK THIS STORY ? SHORT OF AN OUTRIGHT CONFESSION. SOMETHING SOLID TO DOCUMENT. SOMEONE FROM THE INSIDE WHO'S WILLING TO GO ON RECORD. WHAT DO YOU THINK ? I THINK WE'D BOTH BE DEAD BEFORE YOU COULD TURN ON THE CAMERAS. YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST KEPT RUNNING. WANT TO SEE ME ? I'D LIKE YOUR OPINION, MR. DALTON. ON ? ON WHO SHOULD BE YOUR REPLACEMENT. UH... THIS IS ALL GONNA BE OVER IN A COUPLE OF HOURS. YOU KNOW, I WALKED IN THIS MORNING THINKING THE SAME THING. FUNNY HOW THINGS HAVE A WAY OF TURNING OUT. LISTEN THIS, MCNAMARA. HE'S GONNA LEAD US RIGHT TO HER. AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE CHECKS IN. AND IF HE SHOULD DECLINE ? WELL, HE'S A VERY REASONABLE MAN. AND I THINK HE'LL DO THE RIGHT THING. BOY, I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE THIS BEHIND US, MR. DALTON. YEAH. YOU KNOW, I WOULD'VE NEVER AGREED TO HAVE DONE THIS IF I DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY BUILDINGS THERE WERE IN COUNTY RECORDS. WELL, I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU IF THAT MEANS ANYTHING. IT DOESN'T MEAN SHIT. I NEED TO CALL NEW YORK, CAN I USE YOUR PHONE TO DO THAT ? YEAH, SURE, GO RIGHT AHEAD. NO, HOLD IT, NO CALLS. THIS ONE HERE IS SECURE. HAVE ANOTHER DUMPLING, MY DUMPLING. LET THE MAN MAKE HIS CALL. YOU JUST GOT TO SHOW THEM WHO'S THE BOSS. CAN I HAVE SOME PRIVACY SOME PLACE ? BATHROOM.

I DON'T WANT TO SOUND NEGATIVE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, BUT THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE JUST GONNA LET YOU WALTZ THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR. RIGHT, BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ? A WET WALL. HOW COULD YOU TELL FROM A DRAWING ? TELL WHAT ? IF A WALL'S WET. BECAUSE I-- I'M PLAYING. I'M JOKING. YOU'RE ALL UPTIGHT AND SHIT. HEY, ROSE, IT'S JORDAN.

I LIKE TO THINK YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME FOR ME. PLEASE, DON'T ANYBODY GET UP. MR. MCNAMARA. HUGE FAN. SO, WE HAD TO MEET UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU KNOW, I'M JUST YOUR AVERAGE "JOHN Q. PUBLIC". IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SERVED TO STICK WITH THE STORIES ABOUT SUPERMARKETS AND TAINTED BEEF. BUT WHAT DO I KNOW ? AND YOU, MY LITTLE PRETTY. TAXPAYERS HAVE RACKED UP A PRETTY GOOD BILL TRAINING YOU. WHATEVER GAVE YOU THE IDEA YOU COULD TAKE EARLY RETIREMENT ? I TOOK THE FOUR MEN YOU SENT OUT AS A PINK SLIP THIS MORNING. DOWNSIZING.

THIS IS YOUR BIG CHANCE FOR YOUR LAST INTERVIEW, MCNAMARA. WHAT-- YEAH, I HAVE A QUESTION. WHY ARE YOU KILLING ME ? BEFORE I DIE, WOULD YOU JUST TELL ME WHY ? WHY ANY OF THIS ? THOMAS ETELAND. WHY WOULD YOU KILL THOMAS ETELAND ? OH, I DIDN'T KILL HIM, SHE DID. ON YOUR ORDERS. C'MON, PLEASE. PLEASE. HE HAD A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE. THAT'S A DANGEROUS THING. MEANING, I SUPPOSE, THAT HE KNEW ABOUT THE ATTACK ON THE ARMY HELICOPTERS THAT YOU STAGED IN ARIZONA. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHY WOULD YOU KILL AMERICAN SOLDIERS ? WHY ? YOU KNOW, THIS PROBABLY COMES AS NO SURPRISE TO A JOURNALIST OF YOUR CALIBER, BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A GROWING CONCERN IN THIS COUNTRY AGAINST DOMESTIC TERRORISM. ANTHRAX SCARES, MILITIA GROUPS, WORLD TRADE CENTER OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBINGS, THINGS OF THAT NATURE. WE THOUGHT WE COULD USE THESE THREATS TO OUR ADVANTAGE. THAT THESE TYPES OF INCIDENTS, AS TRAGIC AS THEY REALLY ARE, WOULD SERVE TO BOLSTER THE PUBLIC OUTCRY. WHICH WOULD IN TURN GET OUR FUNDING BACK UP TO THE LEVEL WHERE IT SHOULD BE. AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE. WELL, IF A COUPLE OF PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE, IT'S-- ( phone ) HOLMAN HERE. COULD THIS WAIT, PLEASE ? WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING. MANY BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES TO A COUNTRY WHO HAS TURNED ITS BACK ON THEM. I JUST COULDN'T SIT B AND LET THAT CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. WELL, YOU KNOW... YOU'RE WORSE THAN ANYONE YOU CLAIM TO BE FIGHTING. OH, REALLY. AND HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED A TERRORIST IN THE EYE, MR. MCNAMARA ? I HAVE NOW. OH, DON'T KID YOURSELF. BRING DOWN A COUPLE OF CHOPPERS. SNUFF OUT A NOSY FANATIC. THAT DOESN'T PUT ME IN THE LEAGUE WITH THE HEZBOLAH. EXCUSE ME, SIR, I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT. WHAT ?! THAT WAS JUST MEDIA SURVEILLANCE. THEY SUGGESTED THAT WE TURN ON THE TELEVISION. WWZN. YES, SIR. AND SO, FROM THE FACE OF THE 52-03 ARGYLE STREET, HEADQUARTERS OF ALPHA SECTION A ROGUE COUNTER-TERRORIST AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. THIS IS JORDAN MCNAMARA, REPORTING LIVE. MR. HOLMAN. YES, SIR. MAY I PLEASE HAVE YOUR SIDEARM ? PLEASE MAKE SURE A CAR IS STANDING BY FOR MR. DALTON AND MYSELF. YES, SIR. THIS IS YOUR OWN DOING. CONGRATULATIONS. SHOOT HER ! HOLD YOUR FIRE. SHOOT HER ! HOLD YOUR FIRE ! SHOOT HER ! YOU REALLY WANT TO DIE FOR THESE GUYS, I DON'T THINK THEY GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU. OKAY. C'MON. LET'S GO. MOVE IT. WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE. EVERYBODY JUST STAY COOL. SHOOT HER ! HOLD YOUR FIRE ! SOMEBODY SHOOT THAT BITCH. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. C'MON, GO ! FUCK ! WHERE THE FUCK IS MY CAR ? IT'S WAITING OUTSIDE, SIR. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN THERE ? WHAT DO YOU THINK ? GIVE ME THAT. HEY, HONEY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME. WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT WHERE I CAN SEE YOU ? YOU KNOW... I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID WHAT YOU DID. I MUST SAY... I DIDN'T THINK YOU HAD IT IN YOU. NO ? ABOUT DAMN TIME YOU WOKE UP. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ? LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT CHAIR OVER THERE WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR COMFORT. WHERE IS... NO, I WOULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU EVEN IF I DID KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW... YEAH. I DO. STILL NOT GONNA TELL YOU. SO... QUESTION ? THE BROADCAST. HOW ? EASY. LIVE FEED. YEAH, BUT HOW'D YOU GET IT PAST MY PRODUCER ? YOUR PRODUCER HAD NO CHOICE. I INTERRUPTED HIS REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING. SO, THE INVISIBLE MAN STRIKES AGAIN. I KNEW IT LAST NIGHT. IT'S STILL KIND OF HARD TO BELIEVE THOUGH. WHAT THE HELL DID YOU EXPECT ? SOME PIMPLE-FACED WHITE BOY WITH COKE BOTTLE GLASSES AND A POCKET PROTECTOR ? YEAH. SO THANKS. FOR WHAT ? FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE A REPORTER AGAIN. I SEEM TO REMEMBER IT BEING A WHOLE LOT EASIER THAN THIS. WHERE WILL SHE GO ? MAN, DON'T MAKE ME HAVE TO HURT YOU. NOT ON THE LEFT SIDE, OKAY ? TELL ME SOMETHING. WHAT'S UP ? HOW'D YOU BREAK INTO THE WHITE HOUSE COMPUTER ? SIMPLE. I SAID I WAS AL GORE.
