First I'll take this tapping card with the letter T. Okay, pick another card. Ah! The A says ah. Do you know what sound this letter makes? That's a letter D, and it says d-d-d-daddio. Now put the three letter sounds together. - Hmm… T - A - D T - A - D TAD! Haha! That's my name! Right, and if… Phone rings Excuse me, son. Phone rings I hope I'm not calling too early, but I've been up since the quack of dawn. Frog, your talking dictionaries are a huge success. D-U-C-K spells duck. Quack. It's Mr. Websley. Oh, I love these books. I'm tripling my order and need them double quack. Delivery by today. Today? Glad you agree. Sorry, Tad, I have to go to work. How about we sound out more words later? Sure, Dad. Bye. Are you at home right now thinking to yourself, my dad is the best dad in the whole wide world? Yes, he is. Wouldn't you like everyone to know that your dad is the best dad in the whole wide world? You bet! Then enter the My Dad Is The Best Dad In The Whole Wide World Contest! Okay! Just fill out the form in today's newspaper and send it in by 6 pm. M. This evening. T-A-D I know my letters, but making words is a whole lot harder. Lily, will you help me with this? I can figure out most of the words, but for something this important, we'd better get Leap. Well, when I was learning how to read and write, Dad took me to the Talking Word Factory and taught me all about putting letters together to make words. Yeah, but Dad can't know, because, well, the contest is a surprise. Leave it to me. Here it is! The Talking Words Factory Wow, this place is cool! If we're lucky, we'll run into Professor Quigley. Looks like I'm the lucky one. Hi, kids, how are you kids? Bye, kids. Sorry, kids, but I've got to take care of a big order. You mean the big order for Mr. Websley? The Talking Dickerson…iction...eh the Book of Words? No, my big order for lunch. One monster dog with everything. Mmm, looks good. And, Tad, a dictionary is a book that lists all kinds of words and explains what each word means. I have this contest for him to fill in about my dad, but… He needs to learn how to put letters together to make words. Hey, I can help. In fact, there are some amazing word-making machines right here at the Talking Words Factory, all created by an ingenious scientist. Wow, who is that? Me! Professor Quigley! It's Dad! Hide! Professor, we need more talking dictionaries for Mr. Websley. And I have to recondonate the Zoplex levels in the basement or the entire factory will overload. Can you handle this order by yourself? Thank you, Professor. I'll check in with you at the end of the day. Ding dangling participles. Triple the order? Without a crew, I'm like a cement letter in alphabet soup. Sunk. Whoa! Yikes! Professor, if you help Tad learn to make words. We'll help you make words for the talking dictionaries. Then let's get cracking. Kids, you'll be building words in no time. Just take a look. Building words is easy. First, you need some very special letters called vowels. Of course, you already know these special letters, er, vowels. Can you say the name of each vowel as it appears? A. The A says. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! E. The E says. Eh? E! The I says. Ihhhh! O. The O says. Ohhhhhh! U. The U says. Uhhhhh. Excellent! Vowels are the glue that makes letters stick together. And that, my boy, is the secret to making words. You see, kids, when the vowels first come into the factory, they're just like the other letters. But then we turn them into special sticky letters with the Sticky Icarama! We're A-E-I-O-U. We're the vowels. We're the glue to stick the words together. We're very sticky letters. Honey Waterfall. We're A-E-I-O-U. We're the vowels. We're the glue to stick the words together. Peanut Butter Spread. We're A-E-I-O-U. We're the vowels. We're the glue to stick the words together. We're very sticky letters. Blasto Bubblegum. We're A-E-I-O-U. We're the vowels. We're the glue to stick the words together. Movie Theater Floor Soda Spray. We're very sticky, very icky, sticky, icky letters. Nice and gooey. Kids, meet the Word Bammer 100. Good old Bami. She's been around here a long time. But I'll tell you something, she still builds words just as well as ever. Switch broke years ago. Ready, set, you bet! We have words to build, Bami. Every letter makes a sound, the sound you need to hear. First the first sound, then the next, until the word is clear. Yes, old Bami here puts letters together to make words. Great! Could you help me out with this? I need just the right words for the contest. Let's see. Number one, fill in the blank. My dad is a cool blank. My dad is a cool cat. He sure is. Let's build the word cat. It sounds like one sound, but it's really three sounds all working together. The starting sound, the middle sound, and the ending sound. Ted, do you remember the sounds of these letters? That's it, Ted. Now, a bit faster. C-A-T C-A-T Cat? Let's see if it works. Order up! One, C-C-C, C! Kuh, kuh, kuh, kuh, kuh. Yup, that's the starting sound in c-at. That's right, Tad. Then we have the middle sound. Order up, one A. Works every time! And now, the ending sound in cat. That's right, Tad. Order up, Bami. One T. Let's watch what happens when Bami bams them together. CAT! That's Cat. Yay, I made a word! Thanks, Professor. That's just the right word. And we're going to build just the right words for Websley's Talking Dictionaries. For Tad, here's a pat. You built the word cat. And cat rhymes with hat. And what do you think of that? Ha ha ha ha ha! Cat, pat, hat. That gives me an idea. Bammy, we're going to make all the words that end with at, like cat. Please make a batch of at endings and send them down to Whammy Banny. Whatever you say, they're coming your way. At, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at, at. Come on, follow me. We're going to build all kinds of words. Kids, meet the word whammer 3000. I call him Whammy for short. Wow! I bet this thing really cranks him out. Yeah! Hey, look, here come the ats. At. At, at. At, at. At, at. At, at. Great, they're here. Now we're going to build lots of words using the same ending. Huh? Well, Tad, lots of words sound the same at the end because they're built the same at the end. Let's take cat. What word sounds like cat? Bat. Cat and bat. Can you hear it? CAT BAT They both end in… AT! And that's that! Word builder 3000 ready to run. Building words is lots of fun. Bami will send us whichever word endings we need. The ats will arrive first. Now watch this kids. Let's see, we've done bat, cat, aha! Order up one letter F, Whammy. Bring down the at, Whammy. At. At. Fat! He's got it. Fat. Well, now what if we use H to start the word? Order up letter H, Whammy. Whatever you say, letter H is on the way. Release another at Whammy. Hat! Great, Tad! That's hat! I can make words. How about a letter M? What sound does it make? Order up a letter M, Whammy. Mat! That's mat. Great, Tad. I can read! Yes, you can, and we've built lots of great words. C-A-T, cat. What a perfect word for Mr. Websley's dictionary. Be brave, you're off to become part of a talking dictionary. What's wrong, Professor? I miss my cat. Meow. Ha ha ha! First you take the start, then you add the end, at. C-AT cat. Now you've got a word. First you take the C, then you add the at. Put them all together. Now you've got cat. First you take the B, then you add the at. Put them all together. Now you've got bat. First you take the F, than you add the at. Put them all together. Now you've got fat. First you take the H, then you add the at. Put them all together. Now you've got hat. First you take the Z, then you add the at. Put them all together. Now you've got zat. Hold it, hold it. Zat's not a word. Zat. Can't you see? I used an at and that made zat. Zat's not okay. Not okay? Why, I say. Some letters make at words and others do not. And only real words make it into the dictionary. That's right, Leap. That's how we build words for the dictionary. And we're just getting started. Building words is fun. And I need some more words for my form. What's the next one, Lily? My Dad...is the best dad... I've ever blank. Met, Met! Correct, hey, let's build et-words. We'll start with the word Met. Whammy, send me an M please. An M for you and you and you. Whammy, order up E letters and T letters. Order up E and T. Here they come, look and see. What does the E say? Eh? What does the E say? Eh? Met! See how useful these words are? And if we order up a J, Whammy? Hey, hey, hey, letter J. J, J. J! Eh? T, t, t, t. J, eh, t. J, eh, t. J, et, jet! Exactly! Jet sounds like pet. P, p. Try it with the letter P. Puh, et, Pet! Right again. Pet, et, jet, j-et. Same ending sound, different first letter. What else rhymes with pet? Get, set, let. First you take the G, guh. Then you add the et. Put them all together. Now you've got get. First you take the Ss. Then you add the et. Put them all together. Now you've got set. First you take the L, LLL. Then you add the et. Put them all together. Now you've got let. Good job, Tad. What a great machine, Professor. Of course. And there's yet another wonderful thing about the word whammer. It's terrific for cracking nuts. Needs salt. What other words do you think you need, Tad? Um, something about Dad's heart. My Dad's heart is very blank. Big. Big, big, big. Let's build some words that end with Igg. Just sound one out and tell Whammy what letters you want. Okay. Big. Order up letter B, Whammy! Now let's add an igg ending. Big! You are right. See the light? B-i-g. Big! Way to go, Tad! You're almost finished. Better hurry. I'll tell you why. Mr. Websley is dropping by. Uh-oh! Hoppin' homonyms! Kids, please keep making words. Leap, you're in charge. Lily, help Tad with his application. Uh-oh! Now What are we going to do? I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to build more words. Professor Quigley's counting on us. There are words to build, dictionaries to fill, and we're the ones for the job. Ready to build, sir. Okay, let's see. What rhymes with big? Pig. Big pig. Uh, whammy? Order up. One P and another igg, please. A letter P is coming through and a new igg will follow too. Pig! Pig! You did it, Tad! Bye-bye, Piggy. Oink! Oink, oink. Uh, what should we do next? Should we build more pigs? If there's one guy who's at the top, then that guy must be my blank. Top, hop, mop, pop! Pop is right. Order up, please. Order up, P-O-P. Here they come. Look and see. Ah! Pop! Pop is correct. You did it, Tad. Right here. Wow, look at all the words! Wait until Professor Quigley sees what we've done. But I think we can do more. Come on! Super speed, now proceed. Oops. Double oops! Uh-oh. Warning, warning, super speed. Words are coming, all you need. Leapin' linguistics! The machine has gone mad! Whoa! Cool! Spells Tad! Good one, Tad! Hey, more words for the dictionaries. Thanks, kids. This is fun! Fun, fun! Fun's a great word, and one I need for the talking dictionaries. That's a word I can use, too. Good. Let's build it. Whammy, I need f-f-f-f-F, and u-u-u-U, and nnn-N. Ordering letters, f-u-n. Here they come. Are you ready then? Fun! It says, my dad is always lots of… Fun! Fun! Order up, Whammy! All the words we need ending with un, like in fun. Is the hopper loaded with uns? Ordering words that end with un, I will get you everyone. With all these words, we'll be done with the talking dictionaries in a flash. Hey, Professor, I need one more word for this form, but it won't fit. Why not? What word do you need, my boy? We can make any word here. Well, for this question. My dad is the blank dad in the whole wide world. I want to write best, but I can't figure out… Best? Best? Why, my boy, do you know what you need? You need to put two letters in the place of one. Exactly, but… To blend letters together, we get to go to my very favorite part of the factory. Now hang on. Kids, welcome to the sound slide. This is where letters are blended together into even more sounds so we can make even more words. What do you mean, Professor? Well, Tad, let's say you were making the word stop. Stop rhymes with what? Pop. Stop! St, op. St, op, so we need st and op. Right, watch this. Look, there's Lily with a slithering letter S. It just says sssss. And Leap with a tapping letter T. It just says ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta. Listen to what happens when we put those two letters together. Watch out! No, it's okay. Watch this. Bravo! Now the two letters, S and T, are a beautiful blend. You can still hear their two sounds. Listen. St. Great! Now let's take them back to Whammy. Whanny, let me have one of those ops, please. About to drop. Here's your op. Okay, Tad, sound it out. St-op. St-op! Stop! Yeah, yeah, uh, false alarm. Everyone, back to work. What other blends are there, Professor? Well, Tad, there are a lot of blends. You can hear some at the start of a word, like in st-op or st-ep, or the blend can come at the end, like in the word you need, best. B-e-st, b-est, best. That's it! B-e and the blend st. Ha-ha! Let me tell you, Ted. You can use a blend at the start or at the end. There's really nothing to it. Let me show you how to do it. If you take the word top, you can change it into stop with a blend st. Stop. If you take the word fog, you can change it into frog with a blend r. Fur. Frog. If you take the word cap, you can change it into clap with a blend c-ul. Cul. Clap. If you take the word vet, you can change it into vest with a blend st. Vest. A blend is your friend, and there's lots and lots of blends. Try a bl-e-nd. BLEND! And now that we've built all these words, they can all be put into Websley's dictionaries. Thanks for all your help, Professor. I have to get going. My application is due and I'm all finished. Great, Tad. Allow me to mail it off for you. Thanks. Cool invention, Professor. I think it needs more time. Well, that's done. Anything happen up here while I was… Leap? Lily? Tad? What are you doing here? Well, Dad, we wanted to surprise you, but… Excuse me, Mr. Frog, Dad of Tad? Yes, that's me. May I help you? Congratulations, Mr. Frog! You are the grand prize winner of the My Dad is the Best Dad in the Whole Wide World contest. Huh? And to be here to share in your joy, all the way from your house, all expenses paid by us, Here is Mrs. Frog! Oh, darling, congratulations. Yes, Mr. Frog, you are the grand prize winner. And it's all because of this. A terrific entry form sent in by your son, Tad. He chose just the right words. I did fill it in myself. You're a remarkable young lad, Tad. He sure is. What do you say, little brother? First I learned my letters. Every one from A to Z. Hold it! What's going on here? Have you all quacked up? Where's my big order? Right here, Mr. Websley. With my special crew of helpers, it was a snap. What? D-U-C-K spells duck. Quack. Oh, great. I do love these things. Now, Tad, you were saying? First I learned my letters. Every one from A to Z. But when I tried to make some words, I was mixed up as can be. Then I asked my brother and my sister what to do. Professor Quigley showed me. Now I'll sing it all for you. Take a vowel that can stick words together like an A that says ah. Add a sound at the beginning and one at the end. T-A-D makes t-a-d-tad. I can put a new sound at the beginning with a D that says d-. I can make the word dad. Blend some sounds together like a G-L-Guh-LLL. And I'm so glad that my dad is my dad. I can do it. I can make my own words. I can spell out the words I've heard. It's really not as hard as I thought it would be. And I learned it all here at the Talking Words Factory. Oh, yeah!
