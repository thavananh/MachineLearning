He owns a construction company in Norway. - His own construction company? - Indeed. Bravo. Seerat is very happy. - You know the MLA, right? - Yes. They saw her at their daughter's wedding. - Okay. - They have been insisting ever since. They are all coming here especially to meet us. They said they will take the her with them. They may do so. Is the drama over? Tell them it will take some time. Seerat will get married after her elder sister. That is all. Mom. Then there is no way Seerat will get married. Because Sanjog won't get married if we ask her to. Chanchal, just think about it. We won't even be able to say to Sanjog that her younger sister is unable to get married because of her. Our relatives will make our lives hell and talk behind our backs. And listen. Sanjog's marriage is more important than Seerat's. She needs a partner. I understand what you are saying, mom. We can't force her to do anything. Mom, Seerat and the boy are coming. Whatever you have to say, say it to them. I won't be able to hurt their feelings. - Greetings, grandmom. - Greetings. - Sit. - Sit. Sure. I'll get some tea. - Have you come from Norway, son? - Yes, grandmom. When did you go there? Grandmom, I was born in Norway. You have touched my feet with so much reverence, who teaches you these things in Norway? Grandmom, I learnt it from watching my family. How long have you known her? Grandmom, Seerat and I have met only a few times. And in few times, you could tell that you are right for each other? Yes, grandmom. What did you feel, son? I haven't been able to understand Captain even though I've been with him for 50 years. I just felt that I would like to see Seerat with me and in front of me even after 50 years. And you? - Yes, grandmom? - What, yes, grandmom? What he said about 50 years. Now tell me, what should we do, Captain? This will be problematic. If Sanjog gets married before Seerat, won't she feel bad? Seerat is younger than Sanjog. Oh, of course. Sanjog is the elder one. And we are the ones who will feel bad. Sanjog may be happy momentarily for Seerat's wedding, but later, she will bawl her eyes out. But why will we feel bad? Sanjog is ready to get married and that's what you wanted. You forgot what you were saying just minutes ago. What did I forget? We are talking about Seerat's wedding. And what about Sanjog's wedding? That is what the problem is. Couldn't you have taken a little more time? You should have thought about Sanjog's wedding. If Seerat gets married before Sanjog then won't she feel bad? You have already troubled the poor girl a lot. Let her be now, Dhyaan kaur. You forget everything else but you won't forget what happened 25 years ago. Now tell me, what should we do? Yes, Gappi? How does Amitoj sound? It depends on whose name it is. Take a guess. Gappi, I am working. Stop working and listen to me. There is good news for you and there is bad news. Tell me, which one do you want to hear first? Why do you get so dramatic about everything? Go on and tell me the good news first. Do you know who Amitoj is? Your future brother-in-law. Really? Is he an NRI? Of course. You know I had already decided just like you have decided not to get married. The leaders of our family have discussed it. We'll get engaged in a couple of days and married in a few days. And you are hearing this before everyone else on Gappi's news channel. Didn't anyone complain at home about my wedding? Yes, grandmom said that she will bring you to your senses. And you are the one who'll get married first. You know Shivinder, right? They are thinking about getting you married to him. Shivinder? The one who is related to Simmi? Sherry? Yes, the very same. Couldn't you have just given me the good news? Sorry, Sanjog. You got into trouble because of me. Yes, as if you didn't know what would happen. Let it be. Tell me about Amitoj. But only within half an hour. Oh, where do I start? Amitoj, the prince of my dreams. I have sent you a picture of him. Take a look. Oh, I am already feeling so delighted. You think about it too. Alright, enough of that. Tell me, when are you coming? Will you start now or in the morning? I won't be able to come in the morning. It'll take some time. Oh, listen, I have not made any preparations at all. I don't have a single dress to wear. Please come. You will help me with all the shopping. Finalize the date first, I'll come. That means you won't come to my wedding? I will. Why won't I? Let me know the date first. Alright. We'll send you the card. Come. Yes, tell me. Fine, I'll be there two days before the wedding. Okay? You'll come two days before the wedding. Sanjog, can you hear yourself talking? Just let it go. Make me talk to grandmom, Gappi. Hold on. Grandmom, it's Sanjog. - Greetings, grandmom. - God bless you. Seerat must have given you the good news. Yes, grandmom. Then come home quickly. We don't have much time. Nothing will get done here without you. You are listening to me, aren't you? Yes, grandmom, I'm coming. But listen to me. Forget about that Shivinder. I have a boyfriend, and if I get married, it will be to him. What did you say? - Come again. - Grandmom, I have a boyfriend and I will bring him along. Don't you dare bring some random guy home. I will break your legs. Who do you think you are? I will only get married to him. Who is he? Where is he from? So many things crop up later. Then I'll come on the wedding day. Really? Have you found someone too? No, I will make someone come with me just to save myself. - Who? - You know Amreek, right? Didn't you break up with him? Yes, I did. But I'll have to get Amreek along if I want to save myself. What is this drama? Oh, sorry! Sorry! Sorry! You hugged her twice, right? Do you who that was? She was the finance head of the Shaan Multi-tech team. She took my number. Do you know how useful she can be to us? - Dirty minds. - You are just faffing. Hello? Yes, baby? It'll take me another hour. Yes, I will have dinner and come. Just the usual office dinner, what else? No, no, don't get upset. I'll eat with you too. Sure. Love you too. Yes, love you two, three, four, five. Bye. Love you two, three, four. You could have counted to ten. I don't know how such shameless people lie to their wives and go home and face them. It is even harder to tell them the truth. I don't understand how women call exactly when men sit down to drink. Can they smell it? He is more experienced in that. Now forget about the phones. I am hungry. Ask him to come over. Waiter. Get the menu. I am bringing it, sir. Isn't that Sanjog's call? Or am I drunk? You broke down with her, right? It's break up, not break down, you fool. Answer it. Why do you look so numb? Why should I answer? Who knows what she wants now after six months? That's good. He is making a choice. Waiter, get the menu. We want to order the main course. - He'll get the menu. - Sir, I am not getting the menu. She is calling again. - Hello. - Hi, Amreek. - Here, give it to me. - Hello. Wait. Hello. Yes? Are you sitting with Kuljinder and Karamjeet? At our hang-out in DLF, Phase three? Oh, so you called to ask me that? Yes, we are hanging out there. I called to ask you, couldn't you have called me? You consider me as your enemy. You could have called too. You didn't. You will never understand girls. Okay. So, you are the wise one. Hello? Sanjog? Hello. Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Amreek, I want to see you. But only if you want to see me too. - When? - Right now. And get a treat for Katrina when you come. Okay, bye. - What happened? - Nothing. She wanted to meet. - And? - I refused. Get the bill. The main course is cancelled. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Thank you so much. Sit. Sanjog, is everything okay? Seerat is getting married. Isn't that good news? And my grandmom has chosen a boy for me too. You don't know my grandmom, Amreek. She is very clever. I won't even realize and she'll get me married. Sanjog, I... You must help me, Amreek. You'll have to come to my home. I'll tell them that we are together and save myself from all the pressure. I knew it. What did you know? I knew it. You must have asked me to come over for some selfish reason. Why did you come if you knew that? What? What? Why did you laugh? They are my teeth, not yours. Where is Katrina? Kat. Kat, look what I got for you. You are more concerned about Katrina than you are about me. Do you know how loyal cats are? Dogs are loyal, not cats. I know very well how loyal dogs and cats are. Kat, come. - Meow. - You'll have to come with me, Amreek. Oh, you are so terrifying. So, when you said you respect my independence, you respect all my decisions, was all that a lie? What do you think? Then please come with me. It's just for a week. You know me. You know what I want from life. Sanjog, look. I know very well what you want from life and I respect it. I respect you. But I respect myself too and I don't want to get into this mess and hurt myself. Got it? Greetings. Feed her this. Don't eat it yourself. Amreek, I will eat poison. You should be an actor. It will suit you. You will cry when you realize you put someone's life in danger for your stubbornness. Good night. Katrina will become an orphan. 'You don't know my grandmom, Amreek. She is very clever.' 'I won't even realize and she'll get me married.' When do we leave? Early tomorrow morning. Thank you, Amreek. You saved me. You trapped me. Yes, Amreek? Yes, sister. I hope you weren't sleeping. No, no. Not yet. Dara is sleeping and he has gone to work. I am coming tomorrow. I'll reach around eleven. You don't have to go anywhere, right? You'll be at home? Yes, I'll be at home. Come over. Okay. And after that, I have to go to Panjokhda Sahib. Sanjog will also be with me. Did you guys patch up? No, grandmom. Not yet. So? It's nothing. Let it be. And listen, don't let her find out that I have been talking to you about her. Okay? When did you talk? I made you talk. Be quiet. See you tomorrow. Come. I'll be at home. Okay, bye. Okay, bye. Wow. You are packing? Your father will do all the work. I know you'll handle it, Kulli. I mailed you the entire breakdown. Check it. And I paid the internet bill. Okay? Why don't you understand? She is making a fool of you. - I know. - Then why are you letting her do it? You know why. That girl... But it's useless trying to convince you. Kulli, I am going so that I can try one last time. So that I don't regret it later that I left things incomplete. Try to understand. Fine. Go. - But don't return with a broken heart. - Just be quiet. Now tell me, how do I look? - Do I look good? - No. You don't look good at all. Get yourself treated. Okay, I will. Come here. Make sure you get the house cleaned. We'll talk about the rest later on phone. What do we tell such lovers? It isn't their fault. Hello. Drive. Go on. Slow down! Relax. Your driving is worse than Kulli's. Then you drive, Mr. Schumacher. I was up all night trying to finish my chores just to go with you. Just do me a favour and don't crash my car. When I crash this poor thing, you'll find out. It's a great car though. It seems you are doing well. Yes, when you get rid of someone, you end up doing well. Then you should thank me, right? How about I slap you instead? Do you have a charger? No, I don't. No, I don't. - Did you send all the emails? - Yes. - I sent all the emails. - Should we try calling our boy? Make a video call. He will answer. - No, he won't. - Let me call him. Go ahead. Who's calling me now? Just a minute. It's from my office. Hello? Amreek speaking. Amreek speaking... So, Mr. Romeo? Did it work out or are you still just fawning over her? I am going out of town for a few days, sir. Okay. That means it didn't work out. Brother, we are really worried about you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for worrying about me, sir. Listen. If you want, I can give you an idea to win Sanjog over once again. No, there's no need for that, sir. I think I'll handle it myself. All right. As you wish, brother. Hold on. Tell me, what's the idea, sir? Listen closely. I'll send you a location on WhatsApp. There is a saint's shrine on your way. You'll have to spend Rupees 101. Cast a binding spell on her. I am telling you, she will come running to you. If she doesn't come running... - you can call Karamjeet by another name. - No. Nice idea, sir. Very nice idea. No problem, sir. I too have an idea. I'll explain it to you when we meet. Okay, sir. Okay. Bye. I too have been a great lover but not as great as him. You have just come. I have tolerated him a lot. His philosophy... is too much. Yes, I can imagine. What will you imagine? All this mess is because of you. If two and a half years ago, on your wedding day, Amreek hadn't met Sanjog, he wouldn't have been in this mess. Royal Hall. Karamjeet weds Karamjit. This is it. Come along, we are late. Ma'am. Is this the Royal Hall? This is it. Let me double-check it. Ma'am, are Karamjeet and Karamjit getting married here? - Yes... - It's written there. Just be quiet. Did I ask you? I asked her. Let her answer. Ma'am, we are not late for the wedding, are we? - No, it's just about to happen. - We are on time. Ma'am, tell us, where should we get ready? We want to look good too. Look, we can't compete with you, but still... - We should be in the game. - Yes, we should be in the game. Take any empty room. - Any room? - Yes. - Which way? - This way. This way? Which way are you going? - I am going that way. - Can't you go this way? I am just joking. - You go this way, we'll go that way. - Come along. Come on, get in. Kulli, hurry up, let's get ready. Look, it's tangled again. I told Pankaj, to put a hook instead of a string. It's Karamjeet's wedding, not yours, you scoundrel. Stop acting like the groom. Hurry up. He must be angry with us. What do I do with this now? Come and untangle it. Who are you? We are who we are. Who are you? I asked first. What are you doing here? I am trying to tie this string. Why are you doing that? Because my pants will come off if I don't tie this. I mean why are you doing it here? I can do it someplace else. Tell me, where should I do it? - Have you no manners? - I do. I am wearing it. I was going to wear this jacket but suddenly you came. We too wanted to get ready, but... We can't compete with you, but still... We should be in the game. Look, first of all, you can't come into someone's room like this. Secondly, you guys are changing and you didn't even lock the door. Are you from Karamjeet's side or Karamjit's? We are from Karamjeet's side. He is our best friend. We are special guests at this wedding. We were told we can use any room that is open so we came into this one. We did the right thing, right, Kulli? "You look more beautiful than pearls. I want to make you mine, my love." "Your face is prettier than the moon. I will keep you in my heart, my love." "You look more beautiful than pearls. I want to make you mine, my love." "Your face is prettier than the moon. I will keep you in my heart, my love." "This handsome boy has drowned in your juicy eyes." "He is lost your beautiful sights." "Your cheeks are as fair as cotton. I want to make you mine, my love." "You look more beautiful than pearls. I want to make you mine, my love." "Your face is prettier than the moon. I will keep you in my heart, my love." "Your lips are moist like the dewdrops." "You take so much time to do your makeup." "You have won my heart. Keep looking into my eyes." "I want to write a love story with you, my love." "You look more beautiful than pearls. I want to make you mine, my love." "Your face is prettier than the moon. I will keep you in my heart, my love." "God has made me handsome too, just like saffron mixed with milk." "Girls fawn over me but I have my heart set upon you." "Jatt will order bangles for you from Lahore." "This handsome boy has drowned in your juicy eyes." "He is lost your beautiful sights." "You look more beautiful than pearls. I want to make you mine, my love." "Your face is prettier than the moon. I will keep you in my heart, my love." You changed the minute you got married. Is this what friendship is? A person can help his friends a little. Have I not supported you? I have always supported you whenever you needed me. No, we don't want anything. We'll call you ourselves. I wanted to order some tea. It's all right. Why do you need tea? Drink this juice. Is tea more important than this discussion? He wants tea. Sister-in-law, look, listen to me. I have been pining for so long. At least, tell me her name. Please. So you won't tell me? You won't? Fine. You can both enjoy your happy married life. Sat Sri Akal. Sanjog. Her name is Sanjog? What a beautiful name it is, sister-in-law. What a beautiful name! Amreek, Sanjog. Sanjog, Amreek. Names sound so good together. Take it forward. She studied in Bangalore. She studied in Bangalore? I studied there too. Sister-in-law, talk to her. Call her once... Sister-in-law, she isn't seeing anyone, is she? - No. - No? No? Oh, God, you are truly kind. Sister-in-law, do one thing. Call her and ask her if she had breakfast. If she hasn't, ask her to come and join us for breakfast. We'll have breakfast and you can take this matter forward. We won't find a better opportunity than this. Let me warn you first. - Sanjog is a very complicated girl. - Okay. She is full of anger. She is easily angered. And she is arrogant. She is also a little cuckoo. She has so many qualities? Sister-in-law, what else can a man ask for? I used to dream about a girl like her. Sister-in-law, just talk to her. I am telling you the truth, I am not joking. I am telling you the truth too. I am not joking. Ask him. I am serious too. Sister-in-law, talk to her once. Look, you have a large contribution in my life. I need your help. Please. Sister-in-law? - You are going to Gurgaon, right? - Yes. Sanjog and Shweta are going to Gurgaon too. I will tell Sanjog, you can drive them there. Rest everything depends on your destiny. Oh, my destiny... Sister-in-law, you don't know how happy you have made me. Where are your feet? I know where they are. - No, no. - No, it's okay. I am being honest. A guy who has such a handsome brother and such a beautiful sister-in-law, what else can he want other than Sanjog? Okay, I'll take your leave. Have your breakfast. I'll order some tea for you. One more thing, sister-in-law, I want to tell you something important. You married the wrong guy. You deserve better. Do you hear that? Sweetheart, do you think I am wrong for you? Forget right or wrong, I mean it. Talk some sense into him. He won't stop. He is moving forward now. Come on. Come, sit. It's so strange. You were in Bangalore in 2014. So was I. What a coincidence. Which college were you in? - Cristo Jayanti College. - Cristo College? I was at Cristo college too. But that's a girl's college. No, no, you didn't get it. I was saying Annapurna hotel was in front of Cristo college. We ate there so many times. - Right, Kulli? - Too many. We even taught the cook in that hotel to cook paranthas. You must have eaten his paranthas. He used to make such large paranthas. Well, someone has rightly said, every person is separated from other people by six degrees. Two strangers are linked to one another via six people. Six degrees of separation. Like you and I both were only two steps away from each other. I know the male Karamjeet. You know the female Karamjit. They too got married and became one. Kulli, sit properly. - Please watch the road. - I am watching the road. Don't worry. I am looking at the road. Did you think I was looking behind? Well, you don't know this. - Paranthas are my life. - Right! I can't even imagine my life without paranthas. I know. Why won't I know? It was written in my textbooks. There was a multiple-choice question about that too. What did you say your name was? - Cristo college. - Your name. - Amreek. - Amreek. The question was whether Amreek likes paranthas or naan, or pizzas, or a thrashing? Then you must have written a thrashing and flunked your exam. I am joking. But it's really strange. It's so strange that while living in Bangalore, we never met each other. Bangalore is such a small place. Why didn't we meet? Because if I had even seen you once in life, I would never have forgotten it. - She was really studious. - All right. College to hostel and hostel to college, that was her life. And now home to office and office to home. Did you have the same routine too? Here you go. It has wheels. - Thank you, Amreek. - Thank you. Listen! I have heard that Sanjog is a complicated girl. - Is that true? - Yes, it is. - Listen. - Yes? I stopped you because I felt it but I just wanted to confirm. I am just asking but if I ever need your advice, will you give it to me? Just friendly advice. - Okay, bye. - Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye, Sanjog. Come on. They are nice girls. You knew the female Karamjit, I knew the male Karamjeet. If I had seen you once, I'd have never forgotten. This boy definitely came prepared. - Did he score any points or not? - Please. - I can strongly predict something. - What? That this isn't the last time you are seeing him. - Hello? - Hello. Yes, Shweta, where are you guys? Ardee Mall, where else? I am in Ardee Mall too. Where are you? On the second floor. I am on the second floor too. I can't see you anywhere. Where are you? - Look behind you. - Behind me? Where? Oh, okay. I am coming. Coming... Wait! Yes? What happened? Look, Sanjog shouldn't find out that you are making me spy on her. I am worried about that too. You better not say anything to her about you trying to hook me up with her. Girls can't keep secrets, that's why. But, yes, you are a little different. Really? How many girls have you said that to? No, I swear, I have only said this to you. - Okay, come. - I am coming there. 'Well, Amreek. She will come now, ' 'recognise you, but you better behave as if you don't recognize her at all.' 'I don't know you. Who are you?' 'Right? Come on, Amreek, buck up.' - Hi, Amreek. - Hi. We've met somewhere. Where did we meet? Why can't I recollect? Your name is Sanjog, right? - Yes. - Your name is Sanjog. How can anyone forget such a sweet name? You have such a sweet smile. 'Come on, Amreek, it's a great idea.' Sanjog... Hi. - We've met somewhere... - We definitely have. - What was your name? - Amreek. Amreek, nice meeting you. Sanjog, just a minute. Hold on. Actually, I wanted to talk to you. Yes, go on. It was a nice gathering, right? We enjoyed ourselves so much there. You enjoyed it too. I saw you. Did you see me enjoying it? You did, right? We didn't feel tired at all. - We danced all night, right? - Yes... Come, let's have coffee. Sorry, I don't drink coffee. You don't drink coffee? Then come, let's have tea. You don't drink tea either? Let's have some juice then. What will you have? Orange, apple, pomegranate...? What? You don't drink juice either? Very nice. Let's have a shake then. Banana shake, papaya shake, sapodilla shake, Custard Apple shake. No. Will you have golgappa water? - Okay. - Okay? Come along then. Come, I'll take you. Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Do you have some work here? - Not at all. Here? Yes, I had some important work. - And you? - I work here. Is this where you work? I really like this place a lot. I like this very much. Okay. See you. What are your plans for lunch today? Is there any place here where we can have lunch? I mean where I can have lunch. No, you know, I know a place where we can have lunch together. I mean where I can have lunch. You can join too. I mean... We'll look good if we have lunch together. I mean I don't know what I am saying but will you have lunch with me? Will you? "I honestly feel that my life has begun now." "I am happy that I too have someone who is mine." "I honestly feel that my life has begun now." "I am happy that I too have someone who is mine." "How can I live alone? She means everything to me." "I honestly feel that my life has begun now." Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes? You know people miss their chance in all this, right? Wasn't that for people who say, you first? Yes, it was. Tell me something about yourself. Ask. What do you want to know? Everything. You go first. What do you want to ask? Everything. - Everything? - Yes. But I can't tell you everything. Why? Because you mean a lot to me. And you haven't told me much yet. Well, okay. I want to be someone in life. - Okay. - And... I want the world to know that girls are not inferior to boys in any sense. Girls are not inferior to boys. How can they be inferior? All the women in my house, they are not inferior to boys. I mean not inferior to men. I mean to say that I was brought up by the women in my house. My mom, my sister, and my grandmom. - Girls got me ready for life. - What? I mean women. Got me ready for life. "I want to see love in your eyes." "Like I have for you in mine." "You are necessary for me to live." "You don't know what you mean to me." "I think my world is lost somewhere in your world." "Lost somewhere." "I honestly feel that my life has begun now." "I honestly feel that my life has begun now." "Has begun now..." "I don't know when day comes or night." "I can't keep a track of time now." "I just walk with you." "I don't know where the rose petals come from." "I met you and forgot if I had ever cried." "Ever cried." "I honestly feel that my life has begun now." "I honestly feel that my life has begun now." "Has begun now..." So many cakes? They are not that many. There are just two cakes. It must be, buy one, get one free. Is that so? Keep this there. Here you go, it's red velvet. This cake was - arranged by sister-in-law... - It was arranged by Amreek. Just like it is our second wedding anniversary, similarly, it is Sanjog's - and Amreek's... - Amreek and Sanjog's anniversary... friendship also completed two years, that is why I ordered this cake. And Sanjog will be the one to cut this cake. - Bring it on. - Give me some too. - Here you go, cut it. - Cut it. Cut it. Come. - What was that all about? - Settle down. - Rest I will. - Amreek. Why didn't you propose to Sanjog today? Sister-in-law, I think she didn't like all this. I couldn't muster up the courage. It's alright. I'll have to brace myself and talk to her alone. Sir, can I please take your order? Oh, well. Wait for another five minutes. Sir, the band has to go to Delhi for a night assignment. I'll talk to them myself. Brother, just another few minutes. She's on the way. Keep playing. Come on. Order something for me too. I am not going. Amreek is calling. At least tell him you are not coming. I know it was a mistake to say yes to him. I knew that he is about to propose. But you must tell him. Otherwise, it will be too much. Hi, Amreek. Sanjog, where are you? How long will it take? Something has come up. I won't be able to come. What do you mean you won't be able to come? I have to go to Bangalore for a meeting. Bangalore? Today? Yes, the meeting has been pushed to earlier. Okay, I'll come and drop you to the airport. No, no, there is no need to drop me. I'll manage. My colleagues will be there too. Sanjog, you are not trying to avoid me?? Are you?? I am joking. I am coming to see you. Look, Amreek, I have been meaning to tell you something for a long time. Yes, go on. I don't think we should continue whatever is between us. What? Just stop playing for a minute. Please. What did you say? We are not compatible with each other. Look, we don't have a future together, right? I hope you don't think badly of me. I am really sorry. No, no. It's okay. No problem. It's okay. Okay, bye. That wasn't so hard. I was just... By the way, what happened between the two of you? What did he do? Nothing. He just got a little too serious. I mean it was fine if he was my boyfriend, but marriage? Please. My family has been pestering me forever to get married. I can't think about marriage just yet. I want to make something of myself, Shweta. That means he didn't do anything, you did. Waiter, please come here. Here. You come here too. At least you should be happy. Here you go as well. What's wrong, Sir? We are not compatible. Our band? The band has done its job. Keep playing. We are not compatible. Keep playing. Your phone is ringing. Your phone is ringing, not mine. That too for a long time. Then you could have woken me up. Why will I tell you? - Yes, sister. - Hello? Amreek, where have you reached? We are just about to reach. Come soon. I'll make paranthas when you come. Listen, is that girl with you? - Yes. - Alight. Come. - How are you? - How are you, Amreek? - I am fine. How are you? - How was the journey? It was good. Sanjog, come forward. - Greetings. - This is Sanjog. This is Sharan, my grandmom. My sister. Don't feel shy. Think of this as your own home. Sharan, she is very shy. Is that so? Come. Look, how shy she is feeling. - Water. - Thank you. I have a friend whose son looks exactly like him. - But he is cuter. - Thank you. Where is Dara? He is in school. Where is the Major? He is at work. He'll be back in the evening. Please sit. Sharan, we won't be able to stay for long. We are already late. But Amreek won't leave without eating my paranthas. Don't make anything for me. Alright. - Sharan. - Yes? For me. Okay. May I help you, Sharan? No, just sit. I am tired of sitting. And he will eat ten crisp paranthas like these. Is that so? You seem to know a lot. It seems like a deep friendship. It's nothing... I just know Amreek. I know Amreek that much... that I know it's not possible that he didn't tell you about me. He did tell me that he loves you a lot. People love themselves, Sharan. It's all a misconception. You'll see if he finds another girl tomorrow, he'll fall in love with her. You broke my brother's heart. This doesn't mean anything. It's all just poetry. A heart is just a machine that pumps blood. We are already late. I'll quickly go and change and then we should leave. Go on. - Okay, Sharan, Greetings. - Greetings. Okay, Sharan, I'll take your leave. Take care. Tell Major I said, Greetings. That is fine, Amreek. I think this girl is injurious to you. Do you know what the problem is? There is no one like her. Now tell me, what should I do? And I am going for myself. Her grandmom will get her married to someone else. Then don't blame me because your brother will remain single all his life. Fine. It's up to you. You should have visited mom and dad in Chandigarh. They threw me out. I'll go back if they ask me to come. Tell me one thing, what is mom's fault in your disagreements with dad? Sharan, I keep speaking to mom over the phone. Amreek, phone calls are not enough. Mom wants this cold war between you and dad to end. Okay, I'm going now otherwise, she will get grumpy. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Give my love to Dara. - Okay. You two were whispering a lot. What did you say to your sister about me? Nothing, I just told her the truth. Listen to me carefully. As soon as we reach home, we have to show grandmom that I can't even think about marrying anyone other than you. Please be careful. Grandmom better not find out the truth. Are you that scared of your grandmom? Is she the queen of Jhansi? I have been afraid of her since my childhood. And I am still afraid of her. My grandad used to save me earlier. Oh, I am very sorry to hear about your grandad. My grandad is alive. He just forgets things. But that is not happy news either. Oh! Wait a minute. We were saved. Just think about saving yourself now. I am saying we are all safe. And it was your mistake, not ours. You'll find out whose mistake it is. - Go. Teach him a lesson. - Simmi! - Sorry! - Sanjog? You were the one driving? Who is he? Him? He is my boyfriend, Amreek. Boyfriend? Does the Sarpanch know? Well then, I'll come with you. I'll come with you too. It is hard to find such an entertaining opportunity. Hurry up. Come on, hurry up. Give it to me. Sanjog, who is this Sarpanch? My grandmom. You never told me that. You never asked. Well, hurry up now. Or our news will reach before us. You could have at least told me your grandmom is Sarpanch. Param, not yet. We'll ask Shivinder to come in a few days. For Sanjog, who else? Yes, I will tell you when. First, let me deal with the one she brought home. Hello. Greetings, grandmom. Is everything alright, grandmom? The younger one is getting married, the elder one is still unmarried. Everything else is fine. Greetings, grandmom. Give me your blessings. Grandmom, this is Amreek. Sanjog has told me a lot about you, grandmom. I don't think anyone must have told him about me properly. Didn't I tell you not to bring any random guy home? Cat got your tongue now? - Grandmom, he is not just any guy... - Think carefully before you speak. You won't lose anything, he will lose his life. Don't you know me? Have you forgotten? Grandmom, actually... Sanjog and I... I and Sanjog... Sanjog, I like grandmom a lot. What did you say? Grandmom, I like Sanjog a lot. That is what I wanted to say, Grandmom. I have come to know about him. You could have thought better. He is not even one of us. But, grandmom, even he is a human being. Yes, absolutely. Look. Look from this side too. Do you believe me now? He seems to be a dancer. This is too much. This is just too much. What happened, Captain? Someone took my watch. You must have kept it somewhere and forgotten about it. If you took my watch then just tell me. - Oh! Sanjog. - Greetings, grandad. You said you won't get married. And now? You came to your senses, right? Grandad, it's my wedding, not hers. I am Seerat. And Sanjog? When did she get married? Whom did she marry? Grandad, Sanjog isn't married. No problem. It will happen. There is no need to worry. She will do it herself. Why are you talking nonsense? Take him inside. Dad, come, let's look for your watch. Watch? Oh, yes. Someone stole my watch. It's my HMT watch. If I don't find it, you better watch yourselves. Ma'am, this is the manager from the banquet hall. You should have booked in advance. We can't arrange anything now. Just wait. I will deal with the manager. Keep an eye on him. I know why he is here. I have been a Sarpanch for ten years. I have dealt with hundreds like you. Come on, boy. Come, Jassi. What's going on? It's too quiet. Oh, Sanjog, my child. - Greetings, dad. - Greetings. - Greetings, Uncle. - Greetings. - Dad, this is Amreek. - Okay. I told Seerat, Seerat told mom and mom must have told you... Yes. Dad, Amreek is amazing. He helped me a lot in Delhi. Sanjog was busy then. Son, so your name is Amreek? Yes. And were you in the same college as Sanjog? - Yes. - Same class? No, in separate classes. No, I mean our classes were different but we were in the same college. She was my junior. And we were in the same college so... Then I came to this wedding. - So, it was the same college? - Yes, same college. Please send the boy. Ma'am is calling him. - Me? - Yes. Why is she calling me? Son, even we can't ask her that. But if she has called you, you must go. Come on now. Ask her at least. - Amreek. - Sanjog. Why has your grandmom called me now? Come with me. I can't come. I don't know why called you. Just go. Be careful. I have never seen you scared like this. Sanjog, I had no idea you are so influential. My family is, but I am not. Now just go and please be careful. Okay. Oh, God. What do you think? What game is Sanjog playing with us? Who knows, ma'am. You tell me. You like Sanjog and whatnot. I really do like Sanjog. How long have you known her? For two years. What's her nickname? Be honest. If you are a liar, just slip away quietly. You'll be safe. She doesn't have a nickname but... You call her a monkey. But she is not a monkey. Will you go after getting thrashed? Or will you leave quietly? I won't leave even if I get thrashed. And just ask Sanjog if she wants me to leave, I'll leave then. I think he feels I am joking with him. Jassi, take the car under the big bridge. - But, ma'am... - Did you hear what I said? Okay, ma'am. I know you are either Sanjog's pawn or knight, or bishop. But not her king. She has brought you with her so that she doesn't get pressurized. Come out. I am not being comical. Sarpanch ma'am, these rounds are on record. One has to go to the police station and account for them. Use these however you want. Ma'am, let me go. I don't want to be implicated in a murder case. Just leave. Why are you creating problems for me? Be quiet. You will be the witness. Just testify he grabbed my gun and I shot him during a scuffle. You are very foolish. Sarpanch ma'am. You are being unfair to Sanjog. She has to right to lead her life how she wants. Elders must stop their kids from making mistakes. Do you understand that? Listen. Don't tell Sanjog about this. Do you understand? Chanchal, send that boy to Bhullar's hotel. Yes, yes. We'll have to do something else regarding this boy. We scared the manager so much, ma'am. Was that not enough? I am talking about Sanjog's boyfriend, not the manager. Oh, yes. But, ma'am, we must admit something about him. He got scared but he didn't run. I don't think he was scared either. He will go and gossip about me now and Sanjog will get upset with me. You shouldn't have given me that idea about the gun. Yes, go ahead and blame me. Ma'am, you thought of that idea at the last minute. You're too much. Is everything okay now? Everything is fine. Don't worry. I hope I won't have to hear that things can't be arranged now. Yes, Sarpanch. I mean, no, Sarpanch. - Come on, Jassi. - Come. Yes, just stop right here. Stop! Stop! Stop! I have been asking you to stop for so long. Must you come this far? - How much is that? - Twenty-five rupees. - How much? - Twenty-five rupees. I walked most of the distance. Here are twenty bucks. - Take it. It is twenty bucks. - No, Sir. Take it. Good man. We'll meet again. Go on now. Get going. Amreek, what happened? - Nothing happened. Nothing. - Nothing? Actually, your grandmom was trying to get a read on me. She doesn't know what a difficult book I am. Only you can read me. Grandmom didn't try to scare you, did she? Scare me? No. It will definitely happen. Be careful. And please don't run away. I am not the kind of guy who'll run away, Sanjog. What are you saying? By the way, why did your grandmom get a gunman? Grandmom has a lot of enemies that's why. Okay, bye. Hold on. Where are you going? To dance. Do you want to come? Let's go! Listen to me, hold on. Your grandmom suspects us. If you call me your boyfriend then treat me like one. I mean act like you are my girlfriend. Yes. The rest is up to you. I am just telling you the truth. You were this small when you were born. And now look at this piece of my heart. I couldn't even recognize you. Mon, don't make her cry unnecessarily. They took two hours to do her makeup. You better stay quiet. People are mocking us because of you. People have to say something, mom. But don't worry. Our Seerat is underneath all that makeup. Don't let her come near me. "You look beautiful with the Jatt." "That is the reason people turn and look at us." "This boy is most handsome. People say he met a pretty girl." "There are many couples, my love. But ours is unique from the rest." "There are many couples, my love. But ours is unique from the rest." "Look closely at how beautiful I look. I dressed up for you." "I will dance all night tonight. And you make a wonderful dancing partner." "There are many couples, my love. But ours is unique from the rest." "There are many couples, my love. But ours is unique from the rest." "Just smile, I want to click a picture." "Just smile, I want to click a picture with you and put it on Instagram." "I want to hold your hand and make a reel with you." "I want to hold your hand and make a reel with you." "This beautiful muslin scarf looks lovely on your head." "You look nice in this brown jacket. People are talking about us." "People are talking about us." "This beautiful muslin scarf looks lovely on your head." "You look nice in this brown jacket. People are talking about us." "Jatt is dancing on his toes. Your dress is twirling around you." "There are many couples, my love. But ours is unique from the rest." "There are many couples, my love. But ours is unique from the rest." "There are many couples, my love. But ours is unique from the rest." "There are many couples, my love. But ours is unique from the rest." I had fun tonight. I had a lot of fun too. Old memories came flashing back. You ruined my mood by saying that. Are you alright, Amreek? - Yes, I am fine. - You're okay, right? Sanjog, are you okay? Yes. Come on, get up. Take her inside. Son, you aren't hurt, are you? No, no, I am fine. I just sprained my shoulder. - Are you alright? - I am fine. - Jassi. - Yes, ma'am. Go and get Doctor Dimpy. He must be around here somewhere. Send him to my room. I am fine, Sarpanch ma'am. No need for... Are you a doctor? - Come on. - Come, let's go inside. Be careful. Oh, God. - Grandmom, is Amreek alright? - Yes. He is safe. All thanks to God. But what happened? Nothing, I tripped over my dress. Okay... Did Amreek say anything about me? Amreek? Was Amreek supposed to tell me something? His... parents live in Chandigarh, right? Yes, they were in Chandigarh. But they are in Canada now. - The whole family is in Canada. - Okay. Do you plan to go abroad too? That's good. You can go abroad, just like Seerat. No, grandmom. Amreek doesn't want to move to Canada. He wants to stay in India. Well, that is even better. If all good people go abroad then who will live here? - Isn't that right? - I'll be right back, grandmom. You eat something too. Everything went well. - Amreek. - Yes? What did the doctor say? No need to worry, Sarpanch ma'am. He said I'll be fine - in a day or two. - Really? You better go to the bar. Yes, sure. Is that a waiter's jacket? Yes, it is. Brother, go there. The catering guy is getting angry. Does he look like a waiter to you? Get lost from here. You didn't tell Sanjog about the gun, did you? No, Sarpanch ma'am. I wasn't going to tell her about that. Were you trying to scare me? Do you feel scared too? Go, change your jacket and come. - And have a few drinks. - What? Have a few drinks. Sarpanch ma'am, I don't drink. Can I get milk for baby? Yes, absolutely, ma'am. I'll heat this and come. - Listen. - Yes? Get a large bowl of ice-cream for me. Don't tell anyone. Especially Sanjog. I won't tell anyone. I'll be right back. Varyam, bring Amreek to me after you finish your yoga. But, mom, we sent Amreek to Bhullar's hotel. Sent him to the hotel? Why? Mom, you told us to do it. I told you?? So, how did you like Amreek? But, mom, he is not even one of us. Is this what you have learnt from our gurus? What are you talking about? What about you, Varyam? Mom... the boy is not bad. Then it's fine. Invite him for dinner tonight. Okay? Okay. What politics is mom up to now? No idea. Thank you. Hello? Oh, Sanjog, how are you? What spell have you cast on my grandmom overnight? What spell would I cast? I told her not to eat ice cream. - But she said I will eat it. - Amreek. Grandmom is asking you to have dinner with us tonight. No, so, is this good for you or bad? I don't know what games she is playing. Just don't come for dinner tonight. Okay, I won't come. I anyway have a lot of work to do. Thank you so much. Why did you have to act like such a gentleman? You should have just let me fall when I tripped. Okay, I won't catch you the next time. Why aren't you taking this seriously? Don't make grandmom like you so much. We have to think about making her dislike you now. Okay. Think how to do that then. - Look, firstly, don't come to dinner. - I won't. Start misbehaving with me a little. Promise? Let's do one thing. Go somewhere else instead of dinner. Take Jassi with you. Jassi will tell grandmom the rest of the story. Which village do you belong to? What do you have to do with that? He is asking about the village. This is too much. Hey, are you blind? You fell on top of him. Move aside. Move aside. Move. 'Have a few drinks.' 'Sarpanch ma'am, I don't drink.' Drop him to Gurgaon right now in his car. Is a driver available? He'll be here in five minutes. I'll find out. Call him. Kulli. Hey, Kulli. I made a mess. A mess is bound to happen when you ask for trouble. Why are you making a big deal? Just because I drank a little? Kulli, I am missing Sanjog. I really miss her a lot. You ask me what I like about Sanjog, right? You should ask me what I don't like about her. Kulli. "You are my evening, you are my morning." "It's morning when you open your eyes, darkness when you close them." "My love, my life." Kulli, I wrote this song for Sanjog. I swear by God, I am telling the truth. Kulli, I think... if I hadn't gone into the wrong room at Karamjeet's wedding, my life would have been incomplete without Sanjog. I would never have met her. Kulli, Sanjog... there are very few girls who think like her. They should be held precious. Sanjog may or may not find someone like me. But I will find a thousand girls like Sanjog. Kulli? I said that backward. You can correct that sentence. "You are the light of God." "I need you." "You are my evening, you are my morning." "It's morning when you open your eyes, darkness when you close them." "My love, my life." "My love, my life." "I will live with you. I will take care of you." "Your fragrance is like flowers. Your face is prettier than the moon." "My love, my life." "My love, my life." "You are the light of God, I need you." "Just stay close to me. Don't leave me and go." "You are the light of God, I need you." "Just stay close to me. Don't leave me and go." "Before you open your eyes, before your feet touch the ground," "I'll place my hands under your feet." "My love, my life." "My love, my life." "Since you lowered your eyes towards me." "My age stopped in its tracks." "The day when you touched me." "All my agonies came to an end." "Since you lowered your eyes towards me." "My age stopped in its tracks." "The day when you touched me." "All my agonies came to an end." "You are my life, my world. I need you." "You can break the moon and the stars, just don't break my heart." "You are my life, my world. I need you." "You can break the moon and the stars, just don't break my heart." "Before I swear in your name, before I touch my forehead," "my life will end before you part from me." "My love, my life." "My love, my life." "My love, my life." "My love, my life." - Sanjog, my child, come here. - Yes, grandmom? Take someone with you. He was drunk last night. He even fought with someone. Go, check how he's doing. Go now. Yes, I am the one who brought him home. Grandmom, you are still not upset? My child, no one is perfect. You like him, right? - Yes. - Well then, that is that. Here, his phone is with me. Give it to him. Take it. Go. Oh. What is this nonsense? Is this how you wake someone up? This is the best way to wake someone like you up. Someone like me? What else should I do for you now? For me? Whatever you are doing, you are doing it for yourself, Amreek. I made a mistake by bringing you here. How could I know that you'll start playing your games? Games? I am playing games? What games did I play? Tell me. You are playing games. You are leading grandmom on. What did you tell her last night? Are you crazy? You started early in the morning. When did I meet your grandmom? I was at the hotel. After that, I don't know how I got here. Look, Amreek, whatever you are planning, I won't let it happen. So, if you are going to do all this, it's better that you leave. So, take all your things and get out of here. Fine. You've made a joke out of me. What's this, Amreek? The world is not your puppet that everyone will dance to your tunes. What are... what are you doing? Sorry, I blurted that out. Grandmom should have gotten angry when you drank, instead, she sent me to check up on you. Sorry. You know I didn't mean that. - You know me... - Shut up, Sanjog. I know what you meant. You wanted me to take my things and get lost from here, right? Now, I am taking my things and getting out of here. - Move aside. - Please, Amreek. Stop being dramatic, Sanjog. Move aside. You were making a lot of tall claims. That whatever Amreek starts, he always completes it. What did you complete here? Do you know what dad used to say to me and Seerat? That both my daughters are my sons. But he never gave us the freedom that sons get. Someone else always made decisions for me. It was never me. If you won't understand me then who will? But if you still want to leave then I won't stop you. I had courage because you were with me. I don't know how I'll face grandmom. Bye. Sanjog. What do you think of yourself? What nonsense did you just say to me? Is this the way to speak to me? I have noticed you are taking a lot of liberties after coming here. - Amreek. - What Amreek? Stop misbehaving with me. You did it today. Don't do it again. I know your schemes very well. Should I show them your true colours? Please, Amreek. Not in front of them. Why not in front of them? You can do whatever you want, right? You girls start acting too smart if you are not shown your place. Is that so? What is our place? This is between me and Sanjog. Don't interfere. One is enough to drive me crazy. What? Why are you staring at me? Yes, I will drink. I'll drink more and get into fights too. And if it still doesn't work, I have other ideas too. Should I show you a promo? I am more clever than all of you put together. Do you understand? We should think about making grandmom dislike you. Start misbehaving with me a little. You should leave now. Don't make me say nasty things to you. What else is left to say now? Let's go, Sanjog. Sanjog, what's going on with Amreek? I beg you both, Simmi, Seerat, don't tell grandmom. And, Sanjog, what true colours was he talking about? I'll tell you later. He is a very petty man. Grandmom should have shot him when she had the chance. Grandmom what? Don't you know? Grandmom took him under the big bridge. She tried to scare him a lot. She said, go back or I will shoot you. But he didn't leave. He said I have come with Sanjog, I will leave when she says. I thought this man has a lot of grit. But, no. They are all alike. I too got fooled for some time. He acted like such a gentleman in Delhi. When did you realize his true nature? It's not a big deal. This is nothing... What nothing? You are still defending him, Sanjog. Stop it, guys. Come on, let's go. Yes, boss? The King of sorrow. Do you have any good news? It'll take another hour. I'll render the rest of the files and send you. It's okay. You are being more productive than you are in the office. I suggest that you stay there. Kulli, I am very stressed. I am keeping myself busy with work to keep my mind off things. I am not a part of her plans. But she is in your plans, right? What do my plans matter? They mean nothing. There is no hope, my friend. It's enough. I should forget about Sanjog now. You were right. Did she tell you about her plans? She left no stone unturned. She said it to my face, that I shouldn't have any misconceptions. Do one thing. We'll find out if you are a part of her plans or not. It's a sure-shot way. Really? Which saint should I go to now? I am serious. Use psychology. Use your brain, not your heart. Who are they? - What's wrong? - Amreek's sister is here. She'll ruin everything. Ruin what? Do me a favour. - What do you want from me now? - Take the car. I am not coming. - Hello! - I will hide somewhere nearby. Here we go. Sanjog and Seerat are home. Seerat, my child. - Yes, grandmom? - Where is Sanjog? She has gone with Amreek. This is Sharan and this is Major Sandeep. Come, sit. This is our Seerat. Okay. Sharan has come to discuss Sanjog and Amreek's wedding. Please, ma'am. You said we should come because Amreek fell and he is hurt. He did fall. You may ask anyone. But I thought since you are here, we can discuss this too. We don't have much time. What? Captain has resigned? It's a very old newspaper. Ma'am... It is better that you discuss this either with Amreek, or with my parents. They are in Canada. Canada? When did they go to Canada? They did. Actually, my Uncle lives in Canada. May I tell you the truth? I find it uncomfortable to discuss this with Amreek. These things should be discussed with elders. Right, Major? Should I speak with him? Ma'am, I feel you should discuss this with Amreek. Will you send someone? We'll meet Amreek and come. Of course. Kaale. Come on, let's go. Kaale. Come, son, take them to Amreek's hotel. - Alright. Greetings. - Greetings. Greetings. Sanjog is very rich. I just realized that today. Should I worship her just because she is rich? No. I was just... Why does Sarpanch think dad is in Canada? Sanjog must have told her that. She is the one who has put Amreek up to all this. I don't understand, what is so special about her? No, just tell me, can't my brother find other girls? If he just says once, I will present him with a queue of girls. But isn't he in love with her? What love? A person should value such love. I am always worried that my brother will ruin his life because of her. He got engaged to dad's friend's daughter in Canada. He didn't go to Canada, and broke off his engagement too. I don't know how Sanjog came into his life. Amreek was thrown out of the house because of her. Do you know how much mom cries? Amreek and dad still don't speak to each other. That is true. And, don't say anything about Sanjog in front of Amreek. He gets aggressive. Focus on the road. 'What love?' 'A person should value such love.' 'Amreek was thrown out of the house because of her.' 'Don't say anything about Sanjog in front of Amreek.' 'He gets aggressive.' She tried to scare him a lot. She said, go back or I will shoot you. But he didn't leave. He said I have come with Sanjog, I will leave when she says. 'Amreek was asking me' 'about proposing to you.' You won't find such a life partner easily. But only if I need a life partner, right? 'But if you lose such a guy, you will regret it.' Grandmom is right in her place, Sharan. That poor woman doesn't know that I am in cahoots with her granddaughter and... Come, let's go now. Or is there still something left to do? No, you go home. Grandmom has asked me to meet her today. - Let me meet her then... - Then what? Then I'll go my way and Sanjog will go her way. Thank God, you finally saw some sense. We'll take your leave. "It happened slowly, but an amazing thing happened." "The moon sacrificed itself to the sun today." "It happened slowly, but an amazing thing happened." "The moon sacrificed itself to the sun today." This seventy acres of land that you are looking at, this is ours. Thirty-five acres of this land belongs to Sanjog. Seerat was the younger one, she was saved. But I made Sanjog feel that I wanted a grandson in her place. The older she grew, she started fighting with me. Like I was her enemy. And even Chanchal and Varyam would be too scared to say anything. Maybe that is why Sanjog doesn't trust anyone. It was my fault, son. But she is punishing herself. By distancing herself from all her relationships. Amreek, maybe... I am being forgiven for what I have done. You have come into her life. I know, son, you will handle everything. Sanjog is all yours now. Don't abandon her. My granddaughter is very fragile, son. She is very fragile. No, no, grandmom. What are you doing? I am already... My heart is feeling lighter after talking to you. I can peacefully leave this world now... Don't say that, grandmom. My Sanjog will live happily. Anyway, let it be. What sad things are we discussing? I have made a very spicy chilly sauce for you. Come on, let's go eat it. Come, my son. Right, were you saying something? Yes... where was I? You met him and realized he is going to propose to you. - After that? - Yes, it wasn't that... that I wasn't happy with him. But when I got to know that he is about to propose to me, I don't know I suddenly felt very anxious. Like I am going to be hanged. It's good that you didn't marry him. He is a psycho. Who knows what he might have done? No, he was... He was just acting. Yeah, right. He was just acting. As if he is Dilip Kumar. Really? There is nothing so special about me. I don't have any real friends. Everyone calls me crazy behind my back. It's possible that they might even be abusing me. I don't respect anyone's feelings. But no one should hurt my feelings. Neither am I a beauty queen. What does he see in me? Look, you are a beauty queen. I don't about what's on the inside, but at least, you are beautiful on the outside. Okay, I didn't mean that. I really didn't. Okay. Okay, tell me something. You are really not drunk, right? Seerat, I brought you here to discuss a serious matter. Go on then. You have been faffing all this time. What serious matter do you want to discuss? The serious matter is that... Tell me, how should I tell Amreek now? That if he proposes to me now, I will say yes. Come down, girls. Amreek is here. Son, how did you like the chilly sauce? It was delicious, grandmom. Varyam. Yes. - Amreek. - Yes. Come, let's sit there for some time. Sit. So, when is Mr. Surjan Singh returning from Canada? Uncle... I am not on talking terms with my father these days. The relationship between a father and a son is strange, Amreek. They both can't understand each other throughout their lives. When I was your age, I used to fight a lot with Captain too. But somewhere, I miss all that now. I have a lot of things to say to him. But he doesn't listen. If he hears them, he forgets. I have this fear inside me all day. That one day, he will forget me too. Captain is quiet today. Yes. Now, this too has started happening for a few days. Dad. Amreek is talking about you. Amreek. Talk things out with your father as soon as you can. Because very soon, we will have to meet him for something. Yes. Tea. I won't have tea. Have it. I made it for you. No, I won't have tea. Uncle, I must take your leave. I have to go. - But have tea first. - No, I don't want tea. - Okay. - Bye. "You were always ready to walk with me." "I used to stop myself." "Whenever you spoke about love," "I kept stopping you." "I was running without a destination." "My life has come and stopped in front of you." "Stopped in front of you." "I honestly feel..." "that my life has begun now." Thank you, Amreek. For what? For being Amreek. - Grandmom... - I... No, go ahead. Grandmom will talk to you about our marriage sooner or later. What else should I do now, Sanjog? I feel that we should stop. I can't keep acting in front of grandmom any longer. She is thinking something else, Sanjog. Seerat is getting married in three days. It's better that I don't come in front of her now. We shouldn't lie to her anymore. And I wanted to discuss something else with you. What do you want to say? Say it. Sharan has chosen a girl for me. I've met her. I am thinking about her. Congratulations. This is great news. What's her name? Monica. All right then. I'll take your leave. I'll go back tonight. If you want to say anything, call me without any inhibitions. Bye. "You'll go your way now, I'll go mine." "Our paths have been separated, our destinations have been separated." "You'll go your way now, I'll go mine." "Our paths have been separated, our destinations have been separated." "You can return it if I left something of mine with you." "If there is anything left between us, let it go." "Our love is over and our complaints are over." "Our complaints are over." - Hello. - Hello? Sanjog? Yes, Sharan. I wanted to ask you something. Yes? Go on. Does Amreek know anyone by the name of Monica? Yes, he does. The same girl you want him to marry? You can tell me. I just want to know. Yes, it's the same girl. But what happened? Okay. Thank you. "You can return it if I left something of mine with you." "If there is anything left between us, let it go." "Our love is over and our complaints are over." "Our complaints are over." "You'll go your way now, I'll go mine." "Our paths have been separated, our destinations have been separated." "You'll go your way now, I'll go mine." "Our paths have been separated, our destinations have been separated." It's Amreek's call. Yes, Amreek? I have found out, Kuljinder Singh. What did she say? She said congratulations. She congratulated me. You should've seen her face. She said you are starting a new life, congratulations. It made no difference to her. My friend... Consider this as a chapter in your story. An experience. No experience is bad. Yes, I am coming with this experience, Kulli. I am coming with this experience of life. Amreek, you are okay, right? We are coming to get you. I am fine. Why will you come to get me? Are my legs broken? I am coming to you. No, my friend. Your wounds are raw. Tell me where you are. We'll come and get you right away. I am not hurt. I am feeling light, Kulli. A weight has been lifted from my heart. You know there is that chapter in life? I am going to end it and come. It's okay, my friend. This too is a part of life. - We are coming, okay? Stay there. - No, no. I am coming. I'll see you. I'll see you. Hello? Hello? Amreek? "Flowers can't never grow on barren lands." "Hearts can never meet if your thoughts don't match." "Flowers can't never grow on barren lands." "Hearts can never meet if your thoughts don't match." "I don't need any comfort from you." "There is no such turn in life that will come back." "You too are free and I don't have any shackles now." "You'll go your way now, I'll go mine." "Our paths have been separated, our destinations have been separated." "You'll go your way now, I'll go mine." "Our paths have been separated, our destinations have been separated." Grandmom, you didn't see how he was pushing Sanjog around. I honestly got scared. This is very good. There is someone who can control her. Please, grandmom. Someone who can control her? Really? Don't you think that Sanjog needs to be controlled? It is something else. What else is going on? Sanjog will tell you herself. Ask her yourself. Ask what? We are talking about Amreek and your wedding. Grandmom, you have started again? Get Seerat married first. We can do mine later. I will speak to Amreek's parents tomorrow. No matter what the circumstances. Beware, grandmom. If you try to interfere in my personal matters. Who are you to decide things for me? Whether I live or die, what is it to you? Sanjog! Have you lost your mind, Sanjog? What nonsense are you talking about? Who am I to her? What do I care if she lives or dies? Mom! Mom! - Mom! - Grandmom. - Mom! - Dhyaan kaur. - Mom! - Grandmom! - Mom! - Get some water. - Dhyaan kaur. - Grandmom. What's wrong? - Hurry up. - Mom. Mom... How are you feeling now, Sarpanch ma'am? I am alright. You may bring me to the hospital and diagnose a new disease. Lift your right hand. Now your left hand. Come with me, please. Sure. Look. She fainted due to hypertension. She already has diabetes and she doesn't avoid sugar. She is fine for now. But she is very fragile on the inside. You can't give her any stress now. You can take her home though. Okay. Look Sanjog, whatever you want to do, think carefully. This is not the time to seek revenge from mom. I beg of you, dad. I can't even do anything now, dad. What's wrong? Amreek is getting married to someone else, dad. I can't believe that. I don't want to believe it either. Mom, I too felt suspicious. She is definitely behind all this. No, grandmom. - I am not behind this. - I don't trust you. Call Amreek. Amreek, it is Sanjog's call. Yes? Tell me. You tell me, Amreek. Who is Monica? Grandmom? Sarpanch ma'am. Address me as Sarpanch ma'am. You'll hear nasty things from me. I asked you who is Monica? Sarpanch ma'am, who told you about Monica? Doesn't matter who told me. Answer my question. Monica is the girl I am thinking of marrying. And Sanjog? What about Sanjog? Ask Sanjog about that. You should talk to her about all this. I made a huge mistake in understanding you. Grandmom, God knows who is right and who is wrong. What are you trying to say? I want to say that I cannot be who you think I am. Be grateful, boy, that you are not in front of me. I took my heart out and revealed it to you. And what did you do? Is the world only full of lies and deceit? May you be left with nothing. You got late in cursing me, grandmom. I am already left with nothing. I will ask Jassi to talk to Shivinder and his family. If everything goes well, we'll get Shivinder and Sanjog engaged tomorrow itself. And wedding soon after. Did you hear what I said? Can't you speak up? I am ready to marry Shivinder. Sanjog. Sanjog, hello. Listen to me. Hello, Sanjog. Sanjog, answer my call! Answer my call! Amreek, what's wrong? Whose call was it? She is going to get married to someone else. What should I do? Grandmom called me just now. Grandmom asked Sanjog in front of me. Sanjog agreed to marry someone else. Now tell me, what should I do? She is getting married? She said I won't get married to anyone else, then why is she getting married to someone else now? I was sitting in peace. Why did I listen to her and go to her house? Why did I need to do that? Sit down calmly. We'll talk. Kulli, you know I stayed at her house. You know. You know why I stayed at her house, right? Amreek, I know, but let's talk. I'll call her. I heard it myself. She's marrying someone else. Listen to me. I'll call here. We'll talk to her. - Ask her. - I'll call her. Amreek, I am calling her. Ask her. Ask her and tell me. No, don't call her. Kulli, wait. But I am calling her. I won't call her now. I want to meet her. - I want to meet her right now. - Don't decide when you are angry. - Sit down, and we'll talk. - I want to go right now. - Listen, sit down. - I want to meet her right now. - Sit down and let's talk. - Amreek, listen to us. Amreek, we'll talk to her tomorrow. Go back now. Brother, I didn't come here to go back. I came here to talk. Alright then. Brother, I thought you will stop him. I have done that, Kulli. You try to stop him and see. Amreek, what is your plan? I have to talk to Sanjog. She didn't want a relationship with me, no problem. I tolerated it. But how can she marry someone else? I will only go from here after I get my answer. Amreek? What do you think of yourself? Tell me. What do you think? What are these games that you are playing? What didn't I do for you? You said you need time to think about us, I gave it to you. You said you need time to get rid of some complex, I agreed. You are telling me that I am living under a misconception? But... -Let me finish what I have to say, Sanjog. I was never under any misconception. Neither about the fact that I love you, nor that you only love yourself. You have been living under a misconception, Sanjog, that if I make a commitment, I'll get distracted from my goals. You had that misconception. What did you say to me? I am not compatible with you, right? Sanjog, you are not compatible with me. You are not compatible with anyone. You are not even compatible with yourself. What haven't I done for you? I did what you wanted, I came to your house. Do you think I don't know? If you had another option, you'd never have brought me home or introduced me to your family. I came to your house for you, Sanjog. I did all this for you. I got attached to your family. I hurt them... for your sake. I humiliated my character because of you. I don't get along with my father because of you. The day that I met you was the worst day of my life, Sanjog. I have nothing else to say. I give up. I lost. Get married wherever you want to. Spend your life with whoever you want. Do whatever you want. You are right, Amreek. Every single thing you said is true. But do you know the worst day of your life was the best day of my life? It's my good fortune that you came into my life. The life that wasn't leading me anywhere. You taught me how to feel, Amreek. You taught me that I can trust someone other than myself. The walls that I had built around myself for all these years, you gave me the courage to break them and come out. The girl that you met the first time, and the girl who is standing in front of you today, they are poles apart, Amreek. The more loving you were towards that girl, the more she ran from you. Fearing that you might change her. You should have told me earlier, Amreek, that you are going to marry someone else. At least, I wouldn't have killed that Sanjog. It wouldn't have made any difference to that Sanjog. It is making a lot of difference to this Sanjog, Amreek. A lot of difference. I'm not getting married to any other girl, Sanjog. I said that because I wanted to see how you react. To see if I have a place in your life after doing so much for you. Do I mean anything in your life? I found out that I stand nowhere, Sanjog. You are not marrying someone else? How can I get married to someone else? All my life I won't be able to get you out of my mind and heart. Then tell me how I can marry her? Tell me something, Amreek. If grandmom asks you today, will you marry Sanjog? What will you say? A blank answer from me. And if I tell you that I want to marry you, Amreek, then what will you say? Bravo, you educated fools. Make sure you don't do things right. You remember your elders when things get too difficult. You tell me. May I interfere in your personal matter now? What do you want? Grandmom, I just want Amreek. Nothing else. You tell me, boy. I... Me too... I mean... What are you mumbling? Speak up. Yes, Sanjog ma'am, I want to marry grandmom. - What did you say? - I want to marry Sanjog, grandmom. Sorry, grandmom. Alright. Amreek and Sanjog have consented, what can anyone else do? Then grandmom gives her consent too. Were you scared? Yes. Even you feel scared? I did just then. - Ma'am? - Yes. What will we do about Shivinder and his family? They won't leave quietly this time. I know, Jassi. I can accept any discord to see this beautiful scene. I love you, grandmom. I love you too, my child. Come, son. - Grandmom. - May God bless you. Are you happy, Captain? Sanjog has agreed to get married. That's strange. How did it happen? It just happened. I was forgiven. You are happy now, right? How can I be happy? It's not like Sanjog agreed to get married. See? He is back to square one. Well son, enough of this affection. Get lost now. Come back when your parents come. I got scared again. "It happened slowly, but an amazing thing happened." "The moon sacrificed itself to the sun today." "Two souls have met, they have met on this earth." "And, look, the entire sky is rejoicing." "I will live for you, I will die for you." "I will cross all limits of love for you." "I will come and meet you wherever you ask." "I will wait for you right there." "Days are for you. My night is for you." "Morning is for you. My evening is for you." "I will sacrifice them all for you, my love." "My heart is for you. My life is for you." "For you." "For you." "For you." "For you."
