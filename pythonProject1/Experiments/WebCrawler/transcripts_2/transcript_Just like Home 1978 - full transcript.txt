Anna! It's for you. Hey, good morning! - Hello, big boy. How did you sleep? - Put on your slippers. Come, let's play. Come here. Yes, please. - Anna, is that you? - Yes. - It's Andr?s speaking. - Andr?s? - Where are you? - At Moszkva Square. - You're crazy. - Anna... Anna, I'm back home. I'm back! Can you hear me? Can't you hear? I'm back home, Anna. I'm at Moszkva Square now. Don't hang up on me. Anna! Hello... Anna! - Hi. - You can hear me. Can I go and visit you? - I'd rather you didn't. - I'll go anyway. I want to talk to you. - But I don't want to. - I think you do, but you're not alone. No, I'm not. You know what? Forget everyone else now, but me. Right? I can hear, you haven't changed. - Hi. - Hi, Andr?s. - Have you moved back? - I have. Go, Anna is waiting. See you around. What's up? Have I grown taller? Take this, please. All right then. Why don't you sit down? - Hi, Andr?s! - Hello! How did you know it was me? You little... You're the Volvo, okay? - I don't want to be a Volvo. - Then what? - Something else... A bus! Yes, a bus! - A bus? Or a tram? Come now. It's no time for playing. Just leave it on the table. Thank you. I'm sure, you're tired as usual. And you are beautiful... as usual. Anna, Anna... You know, the taxi driver, who drove me from the airport, asked me why I came back. I thought we'd have a nice chat, then he comes asking this. What could I say? Thanks. Hold it, please. I told him, I came back because I left my dog at home. It's not that funny. Yeah... Anyway, the taxi driver did laugh. Your dog was shot by a Ranger. I know, my mother wrote me. I wrote to you too. Yes, you too. Anna... I met Feri on my way up. You've said that before. I know, I know... Want some chewing gum? Anna, Do you know what a wonderful place America is? Especially for someone like me. The word "fantastic" cannot even describe it. I got a job that suited me and some money to start with. I rented an apartment on the 44th floor in a high-rise building. Anna... if you could just imagine... "You can't imagine, Anna, what people are like here. " You have no idea, how much they know about our literature, Dear. And just right here... in this place, "where people are so naive that they think we have bears walking on our streets. " I see, you know my letters by heart. Your letters? You only wrote one. I love you. How many times have I asked you not to say this? I'll say it! Why have you come back? I just popped in for a visit. Only for a short time. I've got a few formal issues to settle and then I can go back right away. I'm telling you Anna, I have a good job there, I have a contract. I'm a teacher. I can finally start working on my book too, you know. You look so ridiculous with that stupid chewing gum in your mouth. You're like a little kid... a stupid little kid. A big nothing... I'll go back anyway. I'll be there again you'll see. I'll go back and I won't give a shit about Hungary. Shut your mouth already! If you don't stop this... Will you do me a favour and cut this? You nobody! You pig! Shut the fuck up! Shut up! How much longer do you want to torture me with your nonsense? I am sorry. If you need something, you know that I'm... unfortunately. I know. All right... Just give me the... Thanks. This is my problem... Andr?s, You have to go now. Don't stay any longer, will you? You should go now. I want it so. Anna... And what about Vera? Vera... Vera divorced me. It goes like clockwork with dissidents' wives. I'll move to my mother in the countryside. "Mother and her warming stove, my heart always keeps that hope. " Then, I'll come back to Budapest, and I'll take on the responsibility. And after that... We'll see what happens. I brought you something from America. Is that okay? Let me, please... Lift your skirt. Higher, higher! Now, close your eyes You can look. Is that enough for you until the evening? Okay then... Good bye. You look pale. You should get a tan. Go home now. We'll do it tomorrow. When I arrived, I had to buy warm clothes and pay for the phone line. You don't have respect without a phone number on your cheque slips. That's when I got my first phone line. I still remember the number. 22-47-49-51 Huh...? That relative of ours called me from Ontario at Christmas. Why are you so silent? Phone... You know how it was when I was there in 1928? We lived in bunks. Mum, I'll go and walk a little. I'll be back by lunchtime. - Is this your dog? - Yes. - What's his name? - Bundi. Listen, I'd like to buy it from you. I want this dog. - How much do you want for it? - It has no price. There are lots of dogs in the village but this one is not for sale. I'll pay 1000 forints for it. It's the price of a pure bred dog. Bundi! If you can spend so much on a dog, buy a pure bred. It's a mix of Pumi and Puli and it's not for sale. But he's so cute. Give it to me, I want this one! I want it too and he's mine. Hey, wait a second... Are you the son of Mr. and Mrs. Nov?k? The Americans? Yeah... Listen, I'll give you 2000 for it. My heart would skip a beat if I got so much. It's big money. Tell me, who do you think you are? I'm not selling it. No money on earth, could buy my dog from me. Do you understand? Do you think he won't like me? Or he'd die beside me, huh? But not beside you? Nay, they can get used to anything. Now, come on! Give it to me! Leave me alone! If tell you to give it to me, I won't accept you talking back. You goddam child! You little bastard! Stop now! "You are my heart's delight, And where you are, I long to be... " Stop now! I tell your mother! You, son of a... mother. This dog is dirty. And his teeth are just like mine. Take it from here. Well, this mixed breed is out of question. Take it. Whose is that one? Come, show me. Bring it closer now! Take it, I don't want it. Get out of here. Have you lost you mind, son? Look, Dad! It has a face like yours on your childhood photos. Okay, that bigger one. I want to see that. That one there. No. Take it. I don't want it. Hey, you! It's a stupid dog. Show me that puppy. Okay, that's enough. It's over! Stop barking now. Go away. It's over. Thank you! So long! Go now! Go! Chop chop! You too! Mum, do you know a little blonde girl who has a dog called Bundi? Is she blonde? Isn't it Zsuzsi? Zsuzsi? Don't know. I met her this afternoon in the field. She came there with her dog. It must be Zsuzsi then. I want that dog. Talk to them. She's the daughter of Ili Kov?cs. You know her well. And how much was the money? Money, money, money... Dear brother, Bandi and Erzsike, I'm excited to send these words to you in the faraway homeland. I's been almost 40 years we last met each other in the harbor when you got on that ship home. I've been always planning to visit you and see the homeland, But it somehow never happened. I was happy to see Andr?s when he visited us. We got to know each other better. I took him to Papa's headstone. I showed him the house. My sons and grandsons also liked Andr?s very much. They talked a lot to him, although they don't speak good Hungarian. Great that Andy speaks good English. I'll let the kids speak now... Hello, Ili! How are you? Fine. What about you? Have you come home? Come inside. Come in. - Take a seat. - Thanks. What is that America like? I saw a film about America once on TV. It was not even close to what your father told me about it... When we were kids. Did it look more amazing, or what? It was like... It was different. Bundi! Bundi! Listen, Ili. I'd like to buy Bundi. It's not my dog, it's Zsuzsi's. I really want this Bundi dog. My daughter loves that dog. I'd love it too. He'd have such a good time with me. I'd be always there for him. Okay? Look. I've become a mother of seven since then. Her father once beat up Zsuzsi so badly that she had blood all over her face. Then the next day, her father gave her the dog for consolation. Ever since they are always together. King... diamonds... ace. Listen, I'll give 1500 forints for it. Is that how much you want it? Well, you didn't change a bit. I would like it very much. Take it if you want it so bad. But do it quick. See you. See you. - Not there! He goes in the back. - Okay, okay. All right then... I don't like your driving style.. You're fast and dubious. I'd been saving up for it for five years. All right, you've told me this a hundred times. You'll get your Alfa Romeo back in one piece. Worry not. - Where is Bundi? Where did he go? - You'll get another dog. - Did you sell it? - For the price of three. The money is on the table. I don't want another one. Give that money back, I gotta get Bundi. You silly kid, I've told you that you can buy another one. - I want Bundi, no other dog! - Listen! Don't try to upset me. - Give back the money! Give it back! - I told you, cut it or you'll get it! I don't accept anything like this in my house! God damn it! Stop! Stop! Bundi, jump out! Stop! Bundi come! Bundi! Can't you hear? Stop now! Bundi! Jump out, boy. Are you afraid of getting out? Stop! Stop! You stole my dog! Give it back! Come on, boy. Jump out, Bundi! Please come. Bundi! I'll report you to the police for stealing. Give it back to me! Come out! I gave the money to your mother. - Stop crying. - Give Bundi back to me! I'll give it back if you give me the money. Come on! I don't like you! I don't like you either. No one will ever like you! He'll die beside you! Come in! Good day. Good day to you. Please take a seat. It won't be long, I don't want to hold you up. I'm afraid, we could not keep you status vacant. To be honest, I thought that you'd never come back. But here I am. - Do you want to know why? - I know. You had to. Hello Zazi! - Hello! - You've grown a lot. I brought you something. You can only get these in America. - Is he here? - Yeah, he's waiting for you. - Long time no see, professor. - Andris! So happy to see you! How are you? Hi! Glad to see you too. - Okay, let me see you... - Have you grown a belly? - Eh, just a little bacon. Sit down, boy! - Same here, I only pull it in. So tell me... Well, Andris, I know about it. Unfortunately I can't help you. Believe me, it's not up to me. Zazi, would you be so kind to bring us something to drink? - Thanks. - What the heck is that?! - A gift for me. - A gift... A gift for her. So then... Who the hell thought we'd meet again in this goddam life? - Andris, welcome home! - Cheers! Look, Laci, now we are happy to see each other just as we should. But please don't think that I am happy to be here or anywhere. We're looking at each other now and talking, but I don't feel like doing it. It's not important for me anymore what I feel or what I'd say. I don't even feel like starting it. See? What a friendly conversation this is anyway. I met a Hungarian man in America who wanted a lot of money. He indeed found his fortune. He made a career like not too many Hungarians could. He was an awful guy. He claimed that he grew to love the new homeland, but he couldn't forget about Hungary either. He got lost between the two countries. He decided to commit suicide, but he couldn't do it. He could neither get even with the two countries nor with himself. He rolled like that. What else should I tell you? I collected some ideas in America, I might try to start writing. I'll try... I'd write a book about Hungarians. God knows, how it's gonna be. Heaven knows what's gonna be and what's not. I feel like a clown. You know... I feel like a man who has a disgusting drop of snot hanging out of his nose, and he's trying to wipe it off in vain. I lived on the 44th floor. In the sky. Way up high. You have a very clever look in your eyes. But I'm here for another reason. Here you are, a gift for you. I'll call you soon. Maybe today. Bye. - Don't go yet. - I've got a lot to do. Bye. Come. We've arrived. Bundi! Bundi! That's him! He recognizes me. Bundi! Bundi! Good morning. I brought the girl. Good morning. What's up? - What do you want here? - I came for Bundi. - Well then. Good bye. - Good bye. - Bye little one. - Good bye. What are you waiting for? - I want to go in. - Easy! Wait! Just a second. I brought your money. Let me in already. All right, come on in. Come, let's talk it over. Here's your money and don't try any tricks. It's all right, Bundi. Good boy. - Mr. Nov?k! - This is okay. Just a minute, KI?ra dear. I'm not alone. Let me finish this and we can talk. Wait a little. No talk is needed. I give you the money, you give me the dog. Why that shouting? Take it easy. I'll be back soon. Relax. Sorry for that. Let's go on with it. - "I work", like this. - "Work". Good. Well, now... - This is it for today, dear KI?ra. - Okay. Bundi, good boy. Why is this TV set here? Is it broken? - No. - Do you ever TV? I do. But only in the kitchen. You do it right. Here is your money. What now? Are you hungry? Yes. Back in a second. Good morning, sir. Are you Andr?s Nov?k? Yes. You are expected to appear at your local police station today. Sign it here, please. Don't forget to bring your passport. - Where do I sign? - Here, please. That's your copy. - Were they looking for me? - No. For me. Okay, here is your leash. You can take your dog wherever you want. Come on now, can you hear? Get out of here. Quick now. I have no time to waste. Here's some money for the train. Why are they taking you? Have you stole something? Now, tell me how is it your business anyway? You got what you wanted. You took my dog, now go back to your village. - It's my dog! - Okay. It's your's then. - How long should I wait? - Are you insane or what? - I'm sorry... - Stupid. Hello. Hi Anna. Anna, can you hear me? I'm cited to the police station. Yes. Oh no, I'm not anxious. Why would I be anxious, I just... They only want to inform me about something or I don't know. Anna dear, listen. Do you have anything to write with? Yes, a pencil will do too. I'd like you to have Laci's number. If anything happens, call him. Just ring him. This is the number: 22-35-27 It's twenty -seven, come on! I'm not anxious, but I don't know... Anything can happen, you see. Yes. Bye, dear. Bye. - You? - I didn't leave. You take me home. You have a car. I'm hungry too. I haven't had any food all day. Oh, how much I missed you. Come on then. I wanna go home. Take me back. I can't take you now. I told you, I don't have time for you. Then, for what? - Don't you have a job? - I don't. What do you make a living of? Why did the police take you? No, no! Do not touch that! Now listen: - What? - "This is his cheese. " Quite good. Not bad at all. Come here, let me tell you something. Look, I make money by teaching English. I teach all these dumb students. And you know I'm really tired of it all, including children, so please go. Are always so upset? No, no. Only in the afternoon. I'm gonna go crazy. My god, I know, I'm gonna go crazy! I beg you to leave now. Go home, get lost. Do you know how I came here? I hitch hiked. I got out of one car, then got in the next one. I always told them the next village, so they don't think I'm on the run. Although I am on the run. Who would want to give a lift to a kid with a dog? Nobody! Take that off right now. Take it off, I said! At once! I'll buy train tickets for you and your stinky dog, then you'll be gone. - He's not stinky! - Then smell him. Go ahead! Don't touch anything or you'll have a bitter end. Put on your shoes, you'll get cold. Don't think that you can give me orders. Dear Bundi. - What happened to you? - Nothing, nothing. - Come in. - You scared me. Happy to see you. Come inside. It's very nice of you... My dear Anna. What happened. You said you'd call me right away. - Why didn't you call me? I was worried. - I just couldn't call you because... - Because I... - Not true! He could have called you. Who is this girl? She's from my village. I bought the dog from her. Not from me but from my mother. Now I brought the money back. - Are taking Bundi home? - I am. Anna dear, please, if you love me just a tiny bit, take this kid to the railway station and you can come back. - Just take her away! take her! - Are you nuts, Andr?s? How could I? I left my child alone at home? - Isn't it somehow possible to...? - I can go alone. Okay, just go right now. Tell me, is this your first time in Budapest? Yes, first time. His father needs the car. His mother is ill. He has to take her to a check up in the city. She's lying. She just doesn't want to take the train. I'm not lying. I spoke the truth. Why do you want to take the dog? You can see how much he likes him. I like him too, and he's mine. - He had a good time here, you know. - I don't care about this dog anymore. What only matters is that she'll go if she can take the dog. Okay, I'm off. I have to run. - And what's your name? - Zsuzsa Hopka. - Bye, Zsuzsa. - Good bye. - Okay. See you, Anna. - See you. I'll call you if I can get a token, I don't have small change. Who is she, your wife? Are you starting it again? It's none of your business... Hey, don't start crying now. If you cry, what should I do? I have more to cry about. It's enough... Come here now. Come. So get your dog and let's go. Hurry up now. I've had enough of you. Come, on boy. Go home with your little owner. You're so cute together. I'm so much moved. Could you light one for me? Thanks. You're handy. - I'll take care of her. - Okay. Thanks. Zsuzsi! Come. Come on, chop chop! I arranged a lift for you. This nice man will drive you home. Okay. It'll be all right now. Fare well. - Do you want anything for the gas? - Don't worry, it's on my way. Thank you. Good bye, Zsuzsi. - Thanks. - Bye. Bloody hell! You're like a shadow. You scared the shit out of me. You little brat! What a cheeky bastard you are! I've told you, I had enough of you. Get the hell back where you came from! And you have your dog here again, huh? Just tell me if you want to drive me crazy. Now, you're here, but you'll be gone tomorrow. You'll go back where you came from... Why am I wasting my time on you? God damn it! Wakey! So? What up? Are you scared? I might get slapped, but I'm not scared. What time is it? It's 10:25 pm. My little brother can wake up in any minute. - See you. - Are you going back to Budapest tomorrow? - Yes, in the morning. - Why are you going? - I don't know. - Please, stay. Good bye now. Good morning. All right. They could hardly gather enough people. Want some more? No. Thank you. The machine can't work on that slope. They know this, still they start looking for workers in the last moment every year. Then they have to hurry to find people. - You left this at the washing bowl. - Where are the fangs from it? I threw them away. Hey, mother! Mother! Come, take off your clothes, you'll catch cold. Come here, I'll help. What are you waiting for? Stop shivering. - Istv?n Ill?s! - Yes. - Good day! - Good day! Andr?s! I'd like to have a word with you. Come on in, please. - Wait for me, okay? - Mrs. Kov?cs... Could you please, give us the envelope for Andr?s? - Yes this is the one. - Here you are. Sign it. - Cheers! - Cheers! It clears your voice. - Why are you goofing around? - Oh, come on. Sit down. You know... Back in the College of Agriculture, I used to sing a lot. I had a good voice. I was a tenor. My classmates would often encourage me to become an operetta actor. I was also quite apt to do it, but at some point, someone told me that tenor wasn't a voice type, but it's a condition. A condition. You understand? I thought to myself "No way, I not going to be a condition. " You know... In the end, with a little detour after university, I became the president of this producers' cooperative If I'm well informed you've also worked at the university. I checked your job record. Yes, I worked there. I was a teacher at the university and I won a scholarship in America. - I stayed a little longer. - You were laid off, right? Yes. I don't get it... Why did you come to work here? Don't you have money, huh? Maybe you have some problem with the police? No, I don't have any problem with the police. I could also earn money in other ways. It was the little daughter of the Hopkas who convinced me. Oh, the little Zsuzsi. I see. The little Zsuzsi Hopka! But how are you related to Zsuzsi? Is she family? No. It's not about that. - She talked me into it. That's all. - But how could she? Don't get it. It's not your business. Do you also agree that I've become weaker? - I get tired easier. I'm not in shape. - Yes. Shall we come here again? - Yes. - Okay. - Can you swim? - I can't. Are you serious? You can't swim? At your age? I can't believe it. You're lucky that you met me. We'll go there to that little pond. It's water is clear. It has a lot of fish in it. Do you like fish? - Yes. - I don't. Do you want to eat some anyway? I don't know. Look at me. You look like Marlene Dietrich in that hat. Do you know who she is? - Do you now Marlene Dietrich? - No. Give me the hat. - Don't you know her? - I don't. She's a very old German actress. She is slim and very talented. She's got this deep voice... "Where did all the flowers go?" That's how she sounds. And she'll live for at least another 50 years. No problem... It's not even so deep. It's about up to my chest over there. Just about your height. Or perhaps a little deeper. All right, come. We can start right away. Just lie on it. Don't be afraid. You have to kick like a frog. Do you get me? One... two... three... All right, all right. Take it easy. I'll show you. Watch. This is how you lie on it... One... two... three... And the feet. Can you see? Come on! Don't you just stand there, swim here. Okay, let's try it again. Come. Lie on my arms. Why are you trembling? God damn it! What are you afraid of? One... two... stroke Not so softly! What are you? A princess? Okay. One... two... one... oh, no, no. It's all right. No problem. Zsuzsi, don't tell me, it's not good. I's all right. All right. Oh, come on. Don't cry. Come, let's run. You'll get warmer. Let's see who's faster. Come! These were our neighbours on the left. - And we had another one... - The one next to it. This is their daughter. They were all born in America. Very pretty little girly, huh? And here is... Look at all those photos of women! The house doesn't have a red light on it because it's a brothel. It's the trend there. Well, if these walls could tell stories... Zsuzsa should be home now. - She'll sleep here. - I don't know why people think that America is such a virtuous country. At least, I didn't see that. - Not only a few women I had there. - Really? - Of course, others had a few too. - Quiet now! She's asleep. - Okay, but... What? - The little girl! And what if she's asleep? Don't bother about her. She's in deep sleep. - Let's have another shot. - No, thank you. - Just one for your health. Come on! - No, thank you. Really. Don't refuse it. And there was this black woman. Oh boy, she looked like a gypsy. Only that, she wanted money for it. So what could a poor man do? He'll pay. Right? It's worth it after all. - Okay, but keep it quiet. - All right... There were all kinds of people there. Even some Irish with freckles. It was a big mix of many nations. All were trying to find their fortune. - Some of them could... - Thank you for everything. - I'm going home. It's late. - Don't go yet. It's late. No, it's very late. I can walk you home if you want. - Good bye. - Good night. - Thank you again for everything. - It's quite cold out there... - See you later. - See you later. Oh boy, if I could ever... They say, you are divorced. I am single. And I would like to have a child. why don't you get married then? Who would I marry? Just look around. Who should I marry in this godforsaken place? All men are married here and their wives are jealous of me. I have to travel if I want to sleep with someone. I have to pay for a hotel room in some city. - Why don't you move from here? - Where should I? I could hardly make ends meet in a city with my profession. But it's good money here. And I also like my job. And I'm already too old for marriage. Nonsense. It doesn't matter today. No, no... We only wish that it didn't matter. But truth is different. It's simple. If you don't get married by the age of 30, you're suspicious. Listen to me, Éva. If I walk you home now, we'll sleep together. And we'll surely have a very pleasant time. But it would be unfair. No problem. I am sorry... Did you buy this Pannonia bike for cash or on hire purchase? I don't know... For cash. - Does it eat a lot? - No. Which is the horn? Here. - See you later. - Oh... Come on faster! No! Don't push me! How much longer do you want to sit here? - What are you fiddling around? - I had enough, thanks. You're not alone. He can drink yours too. That's all right! Hop, little Laci. Hop! Take it... You can stay and wait for her, she'll be home soon. I'm not here for Zsuzsi. I want to talk to you. - To me? About what? - Yep. Well... it's not so simple... After all, it's not so complicated. You're too many of you here... Árp?d doesn't earn good money... What would you say if I took Zsuzsi to Budapest? She'd have a better life, a better school. I could teach her English... I know, you'd miss her much and she is a great help for you. But, I could give you 1000 forints a month. Can't give you more than that. What do you think, Ili? What should I say? I love that child and she is not on sale for money. True that we are too many here. I've got seven children. Women don't have so many nowadays. What should I do? Abort them? However shitty this life is, it's still beautiful. I am 35 years old. I'm fat... I'm sure, she'd have a better life with you. Will you let her then? Why don't you get married? - Why don't you have your own child? - Is that your business? You're right. It's not my business. Will you let her or not? Ask him. - A cigarette, ??rpi? - I don't smoke. Get the hell out of here, you son of a lousy bitch! - Hey ho! - Andr?s! Hi! I've been waiting for you since noon. What's that hat on your head? Don't just stand there, grab this. Andr?s! Anna! Annuska! Where were you for so long? I've almost gone crazy without you. I've been thinking of you for two weeks. I waited for you like no one else. I missed your perfume the most. All these rags... I can't count on mother anymore. She can't sew a button up, her hands are shaky from booze. But anyway, look what hard work does to me. It's bleeding. Bleeding! Dear mother, make something for this fine towns lady to eat. Okay? Come, let's take a walk in the village. I'll build a kindergarten there and a brothel over there. Nice, huh? Our priest lives over there. He is a jolly good man. The cooperative's president lives on the right... I've loved nature and manual work all my life. You know me. Dear Anna, I am the offspring of hardworking folks. Son of an oppressed class. And I intend not to deny my bloodline. You know, it was much better when you were away. But since you're back, I can't stand it without you. Can you see that shepherd there? He's completely stupid. Excuse us, for this water stinks so bad. Oh well, everything is so rustic here in the countryside. It even covers your nice smell. Don't be so emotional. Why let that shark back? Ouch! You'll get cold! Come on run, run! I'll catch you! I'm behind you! Ouch! Ouch! Good God, my back! My waist! Goddam hoeing. We were out in the field yesterday. And now my back kills me. Aren't you cold? Come, let's dance. Come, I'll show you how much I improved. Ouch! My back hurts! Now, I'll show my one and only Anna, how much I improved. I could die for her smile. Fuck that shit! Oops. I just broke my other leg too. Anyway... these are my trousers, my trousers. So good that you're here. Not kidding. You've put on some weight. But I still love you. I'm happy with you. Then come back to me. - This is what you wanted, isn't it? - Well... Andr?s! Feri moved away from me. Don't you have anything to say? Good day, dear Anna. Are your really moving to Budapest? My mother will let me. - Are you happy about it? - Yes. To your health, Cassius Clay. Do you really wanna take that girl, huh? - No, I'm just trying to scare you. - Scare me? And then what, huh? Then, we'll see. I don't know yet. She has to go to school. Oh, come on... You have no money for that. For what? - And will you do if you get bored of it? - What? Well... this game. - What is wrong? - What will you do? Send the child back? Do you hate me? One day you think this, the other day you think that. - And your wife too... - What about my wife? - You divorced, didn't you? - She divorced me. And Anna...? I don't care if you don't want it, I'll go anyway. I've always wanted a father like him. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Go away! Don't shout at me. This wine's quite okay. I don't think, you made it. You have no talent for that. Never mind, just drink it. So? - Nice. - I bet that. - Where's Anna? - She's left. - Where did she go? - Back to Budapest. Has she gone crazy, or what? Maybe. She cried. - What did you say to her? - Nothing. You don't pay attention for a minute and these two start fighting! I swear, something is wrong with women! What are you gonna become if you're already like this as child? Now, beat it! Go to sleep. Go home, I've had enough! Go now, before I do something I'll regret too! Anna! - You also had problems with them, Right? - Well... You can't take them serious. Don't worry... Other hand. See? I'm left handed. Huh? One to one. Listen. We'll come and visit you with Zsuzsi at every holiday. No grudge? No. Are you okay, Zsuzsi, my little angel? Stop jolting me! Are you stupid? - Why do you have to lose your mind? - Leave me alone! You have no word in his. Now what? You'll regret it tomorrow. You're drunk now. You don't even know what you're doing, you idiot! Leave me lone, you snot nose pup! It's not your business, you scum. Hurry up! The kitchen door. I brought the fish. - Good day, young lady. Where do I put it? - Good day! Put it here. Yes, ma'am. They need to be fed daily and their water has to be changed weekly. Do you want it fried or in a soup? Fry some for lunch and adopt the rest of them. It'll be tasty, you'll see. All right, but be careful. - Here you are. - Thank you. You must learn it, Zsuzsi, We never eat fish with a knife. Eat now. This is horrible. I'm sorry for the fish. Though they're delicious. By the way, are you good at maths? - How much is seven times seven? - Forty-two. Put it down. No food for dumb kids. - How much is five times seven? - Thirty-five. Eat. Smart kids can eat. "When you left me one day I was so sad that I almost died. " Let me see. What's this? Here, take it and write. Are you gonna dictate? "There are thirty students in the class. " Eleven of them have dogs. Six boys and five girls do not have dogs. "Six boys don't, but five girls have dogs. How many boys and girls are in the class?" - Do you get it? - I do. Then write it down. Eleven of them have dogs. Six boys don't have. Wait a second, I said five girls have dogs. Aren't you listening? I am. Eleven of them has dogs, six boys don't have You don't get it either. You have no clue about it all. - I can see, you don't get it. - Do you think, I don't get it? Yes. Leave me alone. Aren't you hungry? - I'm not. - Don't you want to work? I have a little head ache. Are you angry? I'm not. Let's do the following: You work alone while... I have a short nap. Eleven of them have dogs, six of them don't, Five girls have dogs, It means that 12 boys and 18 girls are in this class. How many dogs are there? Laci, I remember, I gave you some letters before I went to New York. - I remember too. - I thought, I could use them. Perhaps, you still have them unless your threw them in the garbage. - So, I need those badly. - Wait. - Let me borrow your flat for an hour. - Don't you want to have a chat...? - Give me the keys. Okay? - How can you always think of that? I'd like to tell you something if you don't mind. When last time I told you, I would start writing, I thought, I just had to sit down to it and the words would start flowing. The exact words, I've been long... thinking about. And I have started writing this damn book. And the words really started flowing... Give me the keys, man. Let me have them for an hour. Laci, I can't. Zsuzsi lives there too. You know that. What Zsuzsi? It's Zsuzsi... come on. - Who is Zsuzsi? - And when I finished the first page, I read it and it sounded so unfamiliar as if I didn't write it. It was so much unfamiliar that I almost couldn't read it to the end. It scared me. I'm telling you. - And I thought... - Good evening, sir, madam. - Come home. - Wait, let me tell this. - The second page went like that too. - Come home, dinner is ready. - Now I'm already at page 200. Crazy! - Come home. Who's this? She is Zsuzsi. Is she that Zsuzsi? Are you really Zsuzsi? - Little Zsuzsi! - Yes. - It's over for you, man. - Come home. - Okay, I'm going. - So this is Zsuzsi. - You couldn't be more weird. - Bye, guys. I'm sorry. Man! - Good bye, sir. - That's why no key? - Good bye, madam. - See you, guys. Well, thank you very much for lending your flat. See you. This is not so funny. The minute I decided I would not come back, I started feeling homesick like an old emigrant. From then on, everything got a different meaning. "And from that moment, I've had more and more nostalgic thoughts about Hungary. " I beg you, at last talk about what's going on now. I brought your single letter back. I don't want it. It's yours. Keep it. Andr?s. - I want to talk to you about something. - Me too. Sit down now. Anna... We have no way to get close to the country that lives in our memories from the time when we were kids. When awake, I cannot get a passport, but in my dreams, I'm always there. Does this make sense? Andr?s, I want to tell you something. Okay... speak then. - You know I... - I love you. But I'm not in love. - I love you so much. - And I so much don't love you. Unfortunately. You know, I think, I spent too much time looking out the window on the 44th floor. Don't talk about this now. Talk about us. Why? Why would I? And what do you want with this little girl? What does the girl have to do with this? What are you gonna do with her? Is she your new hobby? I don't get you. What do you care about this? Send her home, let's not talk about her. It's all the same if I send her away or not. It's all the same! It's not about that now... Anna... I don't want to meet you again. Anna, I know that this is supposed to be good, I want it to be good and if we both want it, it will be good indeed. Do you want me to say, I love you? Okay, I'll say it then. I'll say, I love you. I'll say... I love you. I must... - Where is it? - Look more carefully. I can't find it. It must be there. I also put the address on the envelope. Okay, okay, but where the hell is it then? I told you to look around more carefully. Oh, it's here. "dear mother, " I told you that it starts with a capital letter. "Stambled... " You spell that with a "U". "Awfuly"... it's double "L" And "skipping" has two "P-s" in it. "Of course, I exaggerated about it, because I saw... " Andr?s liked it a lot. "So I started... up and down... " Doing what? "running up and down. I made... " "I stomped my feet on the floor, kicking it with my heels. " Don't think, that I failed to notice your makeup. It doesn't fit you at all. Don't do it. That is worth a bad mark. Come on, check it yourself. I don't try to correct your mistakes, you shouldn't try correcting mine. Where is the envelope? I don't know. - Where the hell is that envelope? - It's here. "Zsuzsi Hopka"... At least you wrote your name correctly. Now, stick out your tongue. You should wash your hair too. You'll see how many toys he has. He's got plenty. You've never seen so many toys in your life. I'd buy you toys, but you're too old for hat. Had we met earlier, you'd have so many too. Wow, kid, your head is dirty. For God's sake! You like climbing through chimneys or what? Anyway, this kid, P?ter is a nice boy. I don't say he wouldn't deserve the toys. We'll get him some presents too. Okay? Keep your head still! That's all right... Attention! Here comes the water. - Close your eyes! Burns? - It burns, it burns! Close your eyes then. I have them closed. We're done! Let me see you. Okay, let's dry you. We're almost done. I've known this P?ter since he was born, so try being friendly with him like me. Okay? We're going for a visit. I still have a lot of problems with her, Anna. She is stubborn. She always has to misbehave when I'm the busiest. Some cake? Just like in the good old times. - Don't you have some? - I don't. She's not doing well in school either. I can say whatever to her, she only has bad marks. Although, she has promised to work harder. - You'll pull yourself together, right? - Yes. Yes, yes, yes... That's an ugly dress you bought for her. She looks like an old lady. Why did you choose it? Are you happy? Yes. Zsuzsi! Why don't you play with P?ter? Come, let's visit him. It's all right, just go. Play nicely. He got this for his birthday last year. What's up, guys? P?ter, your toys are scattered all around the flat. See? This one goes here and that one there. So, what's the game? - Look at this, Andr?s! - Which one is yours? The yellow one? Or is it the blue? Okay, there you go... All are mine! Mine! That doesn't work like that. Let the blue be yours. There you go. Now push it. Come on, come on. Push it! Wow, they are automatic! My God! Wait, we might see a car crash. Let's set it up. Why is my car so slow? Yours is much faster! Now, wait a little. That's it! Go, go, go! Come on! Why is it so sluggish? The track is free. Okay! It made it. Great! Wait... Finally! Look, they crashed! A real traffic accident! I'd like some cake, please. ...sure thing. Now shout, Niki Lauda! - Thank you. - Niki, Niki, Niki? But why? Just because... It makes them go faster. All right! Look, it's faster now! - I'd like some soda. - What should I say? Encourage it! I've told you, say: Niki, Niki, Niki! - Niki, Niki, Niki! - Good! - It crashed... - It did, because... You started it too late. - Shall we make them crash again? - Yes, yes! Do it! That's it. Okay, look. Now we... - Do you like the cake? - No. Wait, let's try it again. To the start line! Don't just laugh, do it! Don't push it by hand, it's a different toy. What about the soda? - Huh? - No. Zsuzsi, I'd like to talk to you. But I don't. Thank you for the snack. Where did you hide the red one? I'm afraid, this kid has gone crazy. This kid has gone nuts. Okay. All right, you won, and you alone! I bet, while I was away, you taught her how to smoke. Huh? Where is she? Hiding? She just walked out. - Where did she go? - I have no idea. First, one leaves, then the other too. You're very clever, Anna. Zsuzsi! Zsuzsi! I can't believe this! Do I always have to keep an eye on you? - How can you behave like that? - Leave me alone! You have your own child! You don't love me! - Are you crazy? That's nonsense! - Yes, you have! Up there! What? Don't pretend, you're not aware! You know, he's your child! - Leave me alone! Stop it! - Shut up! How dare you say that? All right. Go to bed now. Don't just stare at me. - Go now. It's late. - Come and help. I have to wake up early. If you help me, I can get it done in ten minutes. - Do your homework alone. - Then we can go to bed. - All of a sudden, so diligent. - Come, come. - What do you want? - Do you want to play? Take it. Get the notebooks then. Let's play the following: Put them on the four corners. Ever since I came back, I've been wanting to say this: One can die at any moment and then it's over. See? You broke it. Well, yes... Just, please, don't look at me like that. I want to ask if you remember that you once said... "Only those die who want to. " And you also said... Stop looking at me like that. And do you remember that timber beam? The one I fixed your swing on. You know, my father hangs the sheep on it when he skins them. That's where my lunatic Uncle J?ska hung himself like a sheep, 20 years ago. - I got a bad mark, please sign it. - What am I talking about? Give it to me. Let me see. Let's play fire dragon again. Okay? It's easy. You have to fold it and light the four corners. Come on, let's do it quick. Do it! Light a match. A match! Good. Quickly. One... Two... Once again there.. Now it's burning. Wait, not yet... Hang on... wait... Now! Go and open the door. Open it quick. Come, come with me Come and see how nicely it burns. Look. Look, how it flies. If I drop it from the third floor, it stays safe and sound. But if you want to drop it from the 44th floor... Why are you so startled? There's no reason! If you drop a fire dragon from 44th floor, that's really beautiful to see burning. Relax. Don't be scared. Come. You know, how much scared I was? You have no idea. I was frightened like a child. I was shivering and trembling with fear like a little kid. My head was dizzy. I was so much frightened. I wanted to come back to Hungary so bad. Let me tell you what happened to me in that room. Sit down here. Sit down. I'll show you. I was lying on the floor exactly like this. I was so much frightened that I had to hold on to something. I also grabbed something with my other hand. I was holding them fast. Nobody came then, not even the phone rang. I was afraid that I'd go mad. I was soaked in sweat. I was so much afraid of going mad. Zsuzsi! Every part of my body was sweating, my palms, my feet, everything. Zsuzsi... Zsuzsi... Sweat was running down on my palms, feet, face... My skin went all numb. I didn't feel my nose. As if it was not mine. My hair felt like plastic. You know what else I felt? I felt that I pissed my pants, you know. I took of my belt, like now. Take it, Zsuzsi! Tie it tight. I had to feel some pain. So I twisted it around my wrist. Pull it! Pull it tight! Then something... something... - Someone's at the door! - Something was pulling me to the window. - I only wanted to run on a green slope... - Can't you hear? - shouting at the cows. - Somebody's ringing! - Just running down a beautiful slope... - Someone's here! Just down, down... I'm all right now. I'll never be foolish again. Andr?s! Open the door! Andr?s! I know, you're home. Open the door now. Let me see your homework. - Andr?s, I got a bad mark. - Eh... you don't work hard enough. What's the date today? October 8, 1977. Or it's October 9. I don't even know. Andr?s! Zsuzsi! It's me, Anna! Let me in! It feels just like at home.
