Now we're ready. Cheers! GLASSES CLINKING ANNOUNCER: 'Live. New York City. 'It's the Thanksgiving Day Parade.' TURKEY SIZZLING Watch your nose, Bella. I know, I'm excited too. KISSES SMACKING If you keep checking that bird every five minutes, it will never cook. - I just want it to be perfect. - Honey, of course it will be. I mean, do you smell that? Smells like Thanksgiving to me. If I was brown sugar, where would I be? Good luck. Danielle, how can you have so many things in your pantry except the one thing I'm looking for? I'll be sure to stock up next time just in case you might need something. Thank you so much. DANIELLE CHUCKLES - Found it. - Good. Will you please let me spend a day in there organising? I just found a jar of mustard that is older than I am. That is old. - Excuse me? - Kidding. Can mustard ever really go bad? And this is why you don't get to do any of the cooking. - Careful in there. - Always am. - Love all of me, sisters. - We do. Prehistoric pantry and all. - Mom! - What's wrong? What's the matter? Dad changed my TV to football! It is not your TV. Don't you have homework? Mom, please. I have the whole weekend. You know the rules. Oh. Aunt Rachel, do you have any old clothes or linens to donate? We're doing a holiday drive at school. I'm sure I've got some things, yeah. I'll look tomorrow. There. Homework done. GREG: What's the score? I think the team in red is winning. Yes! Hey, Maddie, I could use some help setting the table. Can you grab the rest of the decorations? Sure! Any word on when Dad is arriving? Uh, your guess is as good as mine. That's odd. He's usually here by now. Come on! Did you see that call? What a turkey. Can we put these up now? - Not yet, sweetheart. - When? After dinner. One holiday at a time. TELEVISION CHATTERING One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... eight. Eight. Why are there eight? - Ta-da! - Oh! This is beautiful! Did you make this? Yup. What do you think? I think that I am the proudest aunt in the whole world because I have the most talented niece. Mm! KISS SMACKS RACHEL CHUCKLES Wait, these aren't the right napkins. Mom bought new ones for this year. She did? Where would I find those? In the pantry. Top shelf. Please. You're the big sister. Will you just do it? - I'm not telling her. - Not telling who what? Um, Maddie... - She wants to, uh... - Go away... To, uh, camp. - Sleepover camp this summer. - Yeah. - I don't think she's ready. - I think she is. - You're not her mother. - Neither are you. What? I mean, no, of course you are, which is why you can't see that she is all grown up. She can handle this. But what if she freaks out? What if she does? Could be good for her. You really think she can handle it? If you want my opinion, Maddie is a big girl. I think she can handle a summer away from all of this. Keeping her sheltered forever isn't gonna do her any good. Exactly. Maybe you're right. Just trust her. She's a really good kid. You've done well. Oh, why is there an extra place setting? An extra? Well, there's only seven of us, but you set out eight plates. DOORBELL RINGS DANIELLE SIGHS Hi, Dad. Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. What's this? - Bread. - I can see that. I just mean, it's quite the step up from your usual potato chips. I'm impressed. - Thank you. - Grandpa James! Maddie! Aww. JAMES CHUCKLES Happy Thanksgiving. THEY LAUGH - Oh. - Oh. I'm sorry we're late. My dip just wasn't setting up right. Miss Lane! BEVERLY GASPS What did I tell you? Outside of school, you can call me Miss Beverly. Uh, Miss Lane? Rachel, how wonderful it is to see you. It's been far too long. It's wonderful to see you, too. Are you... joining us today? - Yes, I... - I thought I... I told Danielle... Dad, can I talk to you for a moment? - But I... - It'll be quick. Maddie. Why don't you help Miss Beverly get settled? Come on in. That looks delicious. Well, that means a lot coming from you. Just needs to be warmed. 350 for 10 minutes. - Follow me! - Right, OK. RACHEL SIGHS Anyone for another slice of turkey? Uh, me, Greg. Absolutely delicious. I could get used to having a chef in the family. Well, you should, considering that's exactly what's gonna happen. And when is your big day? That is still to be determined. I'm just putting it out there, I am ordained. Oh, honey, nobody wants to see that. GROUP LAUGHING I will let everyone know as soon as we choose a date. From then on, it's in Rachel's hands to work her wedding magic. It's just so delightful the way the three of you work together. Family isn't seen with the eyes... ALL: It's seen with the heart. JAMES CHUCKLES I love that. Rose made that our mantra back when we first adopted our beautiful girls. She gave them matching necklaces too, look! Yes, she did. So we all knew we finally have a family. You know, Greg, I can't remember when I've had turkey this tasty. Nothing will ever be as good as Mom's were. Not that this isn't incredible, Greg. No need. I know what you mean. Mom's Thanksgiving was the best. CHUCKLES - Hands down. - Yes, it was. So was her Christmas. Remember that time I secretly doubled the lights on the tree for the lighting ceremony without telling your mom and caused that electrical fire? In front of the whole town. It was a good thing it was snowing. And that Logan was ready with that insane fire extinguisher. Logan? Rachel's boyfriend. At the time. Your mom was furious. I was so worried she was never gonna forgive me. - Well, she did let you marry me. - It did take some convincing. ALL LAUGH I miss those lighting ceremonies. What are you guys talking about? Your Grandma Rose used to put together the best Christmas event at the ranch. The whole town would come. It was really something. Everyone would light candles and sing. Your grandma had the most beautiful voice. Well, you all do. I miss hearing you. I wish you girls had wanted to keep it up. FORK CLACKS Are you serious? - Rachel. - What? Um, where's the restroom, dear? Uh, down the hall, first door on the right. Thank you. Excuse me. You are seriously gonna sit there reminiscing about Mom's Christmas traditions and say that it's a shame that WE haven't kept them up? - Rach. - Why don't you grab your cookies now? I mean, really! You say you wish that we had kept it up? It's not like her shoes are easy to fill. - That's enough, Rachel. - That's not... The reason that we don't do the tree lighting anymore, Dad, is because it's not Christmas anymore without her! And you all know it! I'm sorry. I don't know where that came from. I'm just, um... Erm... I'm gonna check on the... I'll be right back. FOOTSTEPS CLICKING You OK there, Cranky Pants? Yeah. Sorry. I don't know why I lost it like that. I just... I miss her. Especially at this time of year. I know. Me too. Can I get in on this? THEY LAUGH Sorry we didn't tell you about Dad. - I wanted to. - Thank you, Caroline. We just knew it would be hard. You mean, I didn't take the news well? No more secrets, OK? I need you guys too much. No more secrets. RACHEL SIGHS OK. I better get back up there and figure out how to apologise to Dad. - Yikes. - DANIELLE: Hmm. - I told you. - Thank you, Caroline. WATER TRICKLING PHONE BUZZING Not today. PHONE CLICKS SHE SIGHS Oh. What was I thinking? Donate. Donate. CHUCKLES SHE GASPS That's where you've been hiding. Hey. Keep. Donate. SHE LAUGHS Definitely donate. PHONE BUZZING Not today. PHONE CLICKS SHE CHUCKLES Hi, Mom. SHE SIGHS Mm. SHE CHUCKLES Logan Reynolds. Huh. PHONE BUZZING Really? Fine. CLEARS THROAT Hello? Hi, I'm trying to locate Rachel Miller. - You found her. - Oh, that's great. I'm so glad I was able to reach you directly. - I've been trying all morning. - Yeah. Poor reception. - What's that? - Nothing. You were saying? Yes. My name is Susan Price, Or my fair trade organic silk bedding Lazy Susan. Or my radio single, "Dream It." Anyway, I'm trying to plan a wedding, well, not just a wedding, my wedding. Congratulations. Thank you so much. My fiance and I are looking to be married in Pineview and the little we could find online told me I had to speak to Rachel Miller because she is the very best event planner in town. I think I'm the only event planner in town. Then it's even more imperative that we meet tout suite. I hear that Pineview is absolutely magical at Christmas, that it's simply stunning and I have to have stunning. So you're interested in a Christmas wedding? - Yes. - And you want it on the actual day? Yes. How festive. Let me check our calendar for next year, but I'm pretty sure no-one has it booked yet. Are you interested in an afternoon ceremony? Susan? Did I lose you? 'No, I'm still here.' It's just that we don't want to be married next Christmas, we want this Christmas. Hello? I didn't scare you off now, did I? This Christmas? That's in less than a month. '27 days, to be exact.' 27 days. This one time, we had to schedule a photoshoot for my new scent collection and we only had three days to do it. And there were albino peacocks involved. If we could pull that off, this should be a piece of cake. Remember that, baby? Right. Look, I've seen your work and I know what you're capable of. And I promise, I'll make it worth your while. Spare no expense. We'll make it the most gorgeous winter wedding the internet has ever seen. So, are you free to meet and get this snowball rolling? When were you thinking? How's 30 minutes from now? Half an hour? Sure. Why not? PHONE CLICKS Now, the most important thing to remember here is that we're going for authentic. Real. Provincial. Got it. Obviously, we've got major brand sponsorship options, but I want to commit to the rustic mom and pop vibe. Like hashtag no filter feel, you know? So I want to see all the best local options for everything. This is gorgeous. My very own Christmas fairy tale. It's perfect. I wouldn't be surprised if woodland creatures popped out and began singing carols. RACHEL: It's been known to happen. SUSAN LAUGHS Actually, we should make that happen. I'll have my manager contact the albino peacock guy, don't you think, baby? Wow! SUSAN SIGHS RACHEL: It's my favourite view. PHONE CHIMES Is there Wi-Fi here? Here? BIRD SCREECHES Not really. Hmm. That'll be challenging. But nothing that my manager can't fix too. Connectivity issues aside, this is everything I was hoping for. The perfect winter wonderland. Thank you. It's a really special place and you've chosen an exceptional time to visit. Oh, and this spot right here was my... Your? Sorry. This, in particular, was my mother's favourite spot. Mm. It's really beautiful. Thank you. Tell me about the big Christmas tree lighting thing you do here on Christmas Eve. - What? Who told you about that? - My manager. Although I practically had to pry it out of him. True story - after weeks of searching for the most charming, photogenic, rustic, off-the-beaten-path, unique places we could have our wedding, it never crossed his mind to mention Pineview. Thank goodness his parents sent us those postcards for Christmas. Or we would have never discovered it. Oh, so your manager visited Pineview with his parents? No, it's his hometown. That's why it's so ridiculous he failed to mention it. I guess the most obvious things are often the least obvious, right, baby? KISS SMACKS Anyway, I hear the tree lighting is spectacular and magical, so maybe we could feature it with our wedding too. Oh, so sorry to say, the tree lighting doesn't happen anymore. It doesn't? What a shame. Your wedding is going to be beautiful. I can promise you that. Are you free tomorrow to meet my manager? I like to get him involved with everything as soon as possible. Sure. Why don't we get a jumpstart on the cake tasting? We can meet at my sister's bakery, Sweet Caroline's. It's right in the centre of Main Street. Sweet Caroline's? Like the song? - Yes. - Was that on purpose? That would be so cute if that was on purpose. Ugh, babe, isn't this adorable town everything we dreamed it would be? Now we can really show Morgan Squared that having the same name doesn't make you the cuter couple. Do you know Morgan Squared? Yay! Mm. - Oh. - I knew we'd get along. HORN BEEPING HOOVES CLACKING Rachel? I didn't expect to see you this morning. Oh, yeah. I'm just randomly planning a last-minute wedding all of a sudden! Hey, listen. About the other night... Oh, yeah, I'm sorry about that. I was just having a day. - Can we talk? - Of course. I just have to figure out some scheduling things. This whole wedding is about to consume me! Well, no rush. Whenever you find the time. I love you. I love you too, Dad. ENGINE RUMBLING Come here, baby. Bye. Come on, Miss P. HOOVES CLACKING DOOR CLACKS, BELL JINGLES How long until they're here? Uh, two minutes. - OK. - Two minutes. OK. - Mm-hmm. - OK. Hey, Caroline? Are we missing something here? The white chocolate peppermint cupcakes? - I'll grab them. - No. They still need frosting. You continue here, I've got this. - OK. - OK. DOOR THUDS DOOR OPENS, EASEL CLATTERS Hi, welcome to Sweet Caroline's! I'll be with you in just a minute. No rush. - Shoot. - Can I give you a hand? No, that's all right. Thank you. The place looks great. Smells great too. How long have you been open? Just under a year. Oh, this used to be the Donut Depot. You're familiar. Yeah, the owner retired about a year ago and here I am. Well, congratulations. Thank you. First time here? GLASS BREAKS RACHEL LAUGHS I had a little accident. Um, Rachel... They don't make mixers like they used to, am I right? Rachel... - Logan? - Rachel. Wow. Hi. Uh, this is... weird. Logan, uh, what are you doing here? I am here for a meeting, actually, with, uh... - Do you work here? - No. But Caroline... You remember Caroline. Yes, of course. Hi, Caroline. - Hi. - I'm sorry, what did you say you were doing here? DOOR OPENS We're here, we're here! Sorry to keep you all waiting. Oh, good, you made it. Rachel, this is my manager... Oh, my, what happened to you? Oh, nothing. Just a... sugar explosion. I see. - Rachel, this is Logan... - No need. We go way back. Rachel and I, we grew up together. It's, erm, good to see you again. So you work with Susan? More like completely takes care of me. I don't know what I'd do without him. I'm an artist, you know? I need my freedom to create. I dream up the big ideas and Logan works his magic and makes them come true. I do what I can. I wanted you to meet because it's Logan you'll be working with most to make this wedding happen. How perfect you two already know each other. Yeah, it's... perfect. Shall we begin? Mm-hmm. Cake for breakfast? My favourite. DANIELLE: Logan Reynolds? Logan Reynolds. It's fine. Really. I'd completely forgotten all about him. Red, please! Here you go, Madds. - Oh, no! - No way! It's OK. The pieces are still intact. We can rebuild. GREG: We must rebuild! - We're good. - Come on, Rach. No-one believes for a second that you forgot about him. Logan is your - I don't know - your... Kryptonite? I was going for "one that got away." OK, he is not my "kryptonite." He is not my "one that got away." He's my, "Yeah, sure, we thought we were in love "once upon a time, but when the time came, "we didn't choose each other so maybe we were kidding ourselves "and we weren't ever in love in the first place." Catchy. You should put that on a T-shirt. - Green, please. - Here you go. DANIELLE: Where are you going? We need more cars for the garage. I just don't understand why he would choose Pineview, of all places. Now. After all this time. I mean, wouldn't he have known that I was the wedding planner in town? Maybe that's why he's here. To rekindle the romance. Most definitely not. - Why not? - Danielle. What? It's like you forget how much this guy meant to her. I don't think you understand how destroyed she was when he left. You weren't here. She didn't have to let him go. - She couldn't have gone with him. - She could have. It's not like Dad was going to stop her. You don't know what you're talking about. You were at college. That doesn't mean anything. I was only an hour away. We were here. She wasn't gonna leave us too. Not while... Not while what? Not while our mom was sick. Look, Logan had goals too big for Pineview. I didn't go with him and, honestly, it was better that way. I needed to be here. But now he's back. Temporarily. Done! DANIELLE CHUCKLES Ah, beautiful. It'll do. How does he look? What does that matter? I say go for it. This might be your second chance. Have you not heard a single word I've said? I'm not interested. Besides, he's only here for Christmas and then he's gonna leave again, so what's the point? Not everyone leaves, Rach. He did. Mom... Anyway, I don't even know why we're talking about this. You should have seen it, Dani. He couldn't even look me in the eyes. No-one could. They were covered in powdered sugar. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. We're gonna get through this bizarre "for the gram" wedding, and then everything is gonna go back to normal. You know, I don't think I've heard the groom speak even once? Whew, an ideal man. And sure, maybe Logan is the last person on Earth that I ever thought I'd be spending this Christmas with, but a job's a job, right? And we're professionals. Hey, go easy on the icing. Right? Before we have another accident. PIANO MUSIC Is that... Maddie? GENTLE PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES What do you have there, honey? A song from school. I can't believe they're still teaching her song. - Did you know? - Mm. MADDIE: Whose song? Grandma Rose's. Scooch over. GENTLE PIANO MUSIC # Feel it in the air # There's magic at this Special time of year # And it rings out clear # The message to remember Why we're here # Love will lead us # When it's Christmas # More than gifts we bring # And much more than The carols that we sing # We are evergreen # Together growing, we are family # Forever we will be # Just like the evergreens # Always unwavering # Oh, oh # Forever you and me # Our love is evergreen # That's what makes our family # Oh, oh # Love will lead us # When it's Christmas # Love will lead us # When it's Christmas. # It's nice to know she's still here. Maybe Dad was right. It might be nice to light up the tree again with everyone. It wouldn't work. It's getting late. I better get outta here, have an early morning. KISS SMACKS Love you. See you Saturday. BIRDS CHIRPING, DOG BARKING LOGAN: So, uh, this here, this actually used to be the elementary school. - Oh, wow, I mean, really? - Yeah, I know. So cute. - Good morning! - Good morning! - What you got there? - Sustenance. We have a very busy day ahead of us. I have sugar-free, gluten-free, vegan banana nut muffins for you. You're an angel. And for you, no nuts. You remembered. Aww, you guys are already so in sync. Which is perfect! Because I have an announcement. Denny and I have to go back home. What? When? - Right now. - Why? Your schedule has been cleared for the next three weeks. I know, but the Wi-Fi here has been abysmal and Zahara just invited us to Bruno's birthday party. Remind me who Bruno is? Her corgi, and before you say anything, imagine what a photo with Zahara could do for our brand exposure. We simply can't miss it. So the wedding is off? Oh, no. The show must go on. We love it here, don't we, babe? We just can't be here until the wedding. Or at least the night before. But I'm not worried at all. You can stay here and work with Rachel on everything. You know what's best for me and with Rachel's help, I know you'll not only pull off the wedding of my dreams, but also finally tip me over that coveted two million mark. - Two million? - Followers. Logan's the reason I hit my first million and we're this close to hitting two. No pressure. So are you... Leaving you two to it? Yes, we are. We'll be back in a couple weeks. Don't have too much fun without us. Oh, look at the view. My first runaway bride. And groom. Are we really planning their wedding without them? Sure looks that way. Does Denny speak? That, I am still trying to figure out. Right. Well, shall we? Lead the way. Well, get my saddle, I am ready to ride! You are a good-looking groom. BOTH: Oh, no. - Oh, yes. - He's not the groom. Aw... My, my, what a handsome groom you are. - He's not the groom. - I'm not the groom. I see. Logan works with the bride and groom, who are not able to make it. - We'll send them photos instead. - But how will we know it's the right tuxedo if we don't see it on? You know, see it live and... breathe and move! You will model. Me? - No, I don't... - Actually, yeah, that's a great idea. - Mm-mm. - It's a great idea. Take your pants off. Mm. Are you single? - Miss Rachel here is really... - Mr Michaels. I'm sorry. I'm just so inspired seeing the two of you. Together. # Bring out that mistletoe... # Ugh, isn't he delicious? He's something, for sure. Yeah, show her the cummerbund. Lucky cummerbund. LAUGHS I'm usually not wrong about this sort of thing. Are you sure? BOTH: We're sure. Logan's client is getting married, so he's here to help make the arrangements with me. I see. So could you show us your best winter florals? Anything for Rachel. Isn't she lovely? RACHEL CLEARS THROAT OK, OK. Let's get started. Magnificent, no? Maybe Denny is a little retro? Retro? I think you mean timeless, darling. - Why don't we choose a flower? - Of course. The most important part. Since it's a Christmas wedding, what're we thinking? Snow Drops? Poinsettias? Well, you can never have too many poinsettias. - Should I button it? - No, no. Don't cover those ruffles. What about Hellebore? They're divine this time of year. Throw in some holly and maybe some cranberries, and then we can just go ahead and... I'll just run to the back and whip something together. They're flammable, so don't go near candles. - OK. - OK, come on. It's just something that I threw together. You just threw this together? - Too much? - No, no. This is... this is incredible. PAULA GASPS Oh! PAULA CLAPPING Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Probably not, Paula. Probably not. CAMERA SNAPS There's a reason why I go to Mr Michaels for all my floral needs. It doesn't hurt that I'm the only florist in town. # Feels like it's Christmas # When I'm with you. # - RACHEL: Wow. - Huh, huh? Oh. Thank you. RACHEL: Very good. - Oh, no, stop. - Oh, yeah. A little more. LAUGHS Not bad, not bad. I do. BOTH LAUGHING I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Unless he's not. OK. All right. RACHEL: I can't believe I'm doing this. Hey, I had to. It's only fair. We have to see it live... And breathe. - We must. - I know. LOGAN LAUGHS This magazine is amazing. Do people really have themed weddings? Oh, all the time. They're huge right now. "Take your mermaid dress to new depths "with a fully aquatic adventure. "Adorn the room with sand seaweed and shell curtains "for a swimmingly good time. "Just be sure to remind your guests "that forks are for eating and not grooming." Is this for real? Reconsidering our winter wonderland look? Yeah, maybe. "Add a cargo of talking parrots, "rum-soaked cake, and gold doubloons "and you, too, can have the pirate wedding of your dreams "that will leave your guests yo-ho-hoing for more." Hey, you were obsessed with pirates, remember? Uh, we. We were obsessed with pirates once. It wasn't me who made you walk the plank. You deserved it. - I did not. - Did too! You got us in trouble in Mr Sheppard's class. - For passing notes to you. - You should have been more subtle. - I was 10. - So was I. I still remember the look on your face when you... What? How's it look? Is it that bad? No. No, no, you look incredible. The dress, the dress, on you, it looks incredible. You're perfect... It's perfect. How's the hem? Oh, honey, nobody is gonna be worried about that hem when they see you in this. They won't see me in this. It's for Susan. Oh. Right. Of course. I'll go get some pins. Let's see what Susan thinks. Yeah. Yeah, let's see what she thinks. Mm. RACHEL SIGHS, CAMERA SNAPPING BOTH CHUCKLING Got it. OK. Oh! Good catch. PHONE PINGS She likes it. Great! - We've got the one! - Oh, good! I'm gonna go change out of this. OK, right. I'll be right here. RACHEL SIGHS I'm gonna go turn the thermostat down. It's getting a little warm in here, don't you think? Thank you. SERVER: How are you two doing? Good. Thank you. So... So? This is quite a system you got here. It's tried and true. Mm. How long you been doing this? Wedding planning. I started not too long after you left. So... So? When did you start working with Susan? Oh, you know. We met at this industry event a couple years back. She was looking to get into the music business the same time I was looking to get out. - And did you? - Did I what? Get out. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you can say I did. - So... - So... Why Pineview? I knew that question was coming, and, no, the decision was definitely not mine. Trust me, the last thing I wanted do was this whole wedding thing here. Mm. Nope, that is not what I meant. No, I understand. You couldn't wait to leave this place. That's why I was surprised you picked Pineview. But work is work, I guess. Like it or not. I think that about covers everything for tonight. I forwarded you the invoice from Paula. Thank you. I've already taken care of the accounts with the caterer, the band, and Mr Michaels. Am I forgetting anyone? I don't think so. Great. I'm actually on track to close out the books before the new year. And what about you? Have you spoken to anyone? - Like who? - Dad. 'I haven't.' Rachel. Come on. I don't like secrets in this family. You can't be mad at him. - It's been... - I'm not mad at him for dating, I'm mad that no-one told me. Rachel, I've known you your whole life. It's that he's dating. Oh, crap. What was that? Uh, nothing. Can you at least pretend to be OK with Dad? He's taking Maddie Christmas tree shopping tomorrow, maybe that would be a good time to "run into" him. Using your first-born as bait? Clever. But it's not gonna work. I have too much to do. - But... - I love you, Danielle. I've gotta go. Goodnight. PAPERS RUSTLING Like it or not. BIRDS CHIRPING - This one! - OK. Wait, no, this one's the best! Hold on. What'd you find? This is the one, Grandpa. Now why is this the one? I just know it! JAMES LAUGHS I can't argue with that. I guess we have a winner. Yes! Well, hello, stranger. - James, how are you? - Ah, Robert. Sherry. You have a great crop this year. And you've picked out the nicest tree here. Well done, little lady. How are the girls? We've been spending a little bit too much time with Caroline if I must admit. Yeah, I've come down with a bit of a sweet tooth this past year. It's a losing battle. But thanks for supporting her. Oh, of course. She has the best bakery in town. And how's Danielle? Great. She's gonna make me a grandpa again. - That's wonderful news! - Ah, congratulations. It's gonna be a boy. I mean, it just has to be a boy. THEY LAUGH Of course, Rachel must be busy with the wedding. Well, news sure travels fast around here. - What do you mean? - Well, I didn't know people knew so much about Rachel's business. Well, Logan's working on it too. What'd you say now? The wedding that Rachel is planning, it's for Logan's client, Susan. You're kidding? Well, world gets smaller and smaller, doesn't it? Ah, Mr Miller! I've been meaning to stop by the ranch and say hello. Oh, I barely recognise you. It's good to see you. It's good to see you too. - It's been a while. - Yeah. Hey, why don't I give you a hand with that tree? No, no, no. I got it. JAMES CHUCKLES BACK CRACKS Oh! Oh. - Are you OK? - Yeah, yeah, it's just my... BACK CRACKS Ah! JAMES LAUGHS Oh. Think I'll just hang here for a minute. JAMES PANTING - Just give me a moment. - That sounds like a plan. OK. Thanks. HORSE WHINNIES I could have sworn those lights were here somewhere. ENGINE RUMBLING All right. Nice and easy. BACK CRACKS Ooh! I got ya. RACHEL: Dad, what happened? Uh, nothing. Just my back. CHUCKLES RACHEL: What can I do? I just need to lay down, take it easy for a little while. - But what about the tree? - I'm sorry, Madds, but the tree will have to wait. - I can stay and help. - That's OK. We've got this. But how will we get the star on top? - I'll do it, sweetie. - You're not tall enough. - I would love to help. - You really don't have to do this. Are you kidding? I get to do this. And it's gonna be awesome. Oh! And later, there's supposed to be a meteor shower. And Miss Carter said that we'll get extra credit if we watch it. Can we watch it all together? I'm sure that Logan has more important things to do. Sounds like a fun night to me. Lead the way, Maddie. Let's go. Oh, Maddie, not this one. But it says "tree lighting". Is that the one for the ceremony? - What ceremony? - Nothing, honey. The big Pineview Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony. Susan says it's not happening anymore. - It's not. - Well, why not? It used to be my favourite part of Christmas. And the songs, I bet I know every single word. We just can't do it. Why? You got everything you need right there. No, we don't. We don't have... the right kind of... trees anymore. Trees? Hmm, maybe I could help. You know, I happen to know this guy. His dad owns a tree farm. Thanks, but no, it'll be too much to deal with, what with the wedding and all. Let me take this one back and I will grab the one for inside the house. She gets grumpy around Christmas. Does she? My mom says it's stress. - Well, your mom's probably right. - My dad says it's horse phones. LOGAN LAUGHS Horse phones? Here we are. This is the one that has the star for the top. Ooh, can I do it? - Ready for takeoff! - Roger that. LOGAN GRUNTS HE PLAYS 'SILENT NIGHT' Still got it. LOGAN CHUCKLES LOGAN SIGHS Can't think of the last time I picked one of these things up. - You don't play anymore? - No, not really. Your turn. I don't really play or sing anymore either. Humour me. Just one. - I don't know... - Oh, come on, Rachel. - What song? - I don't know. Any of them. Uh, wait. Um, this one. Let's see if you remember it. GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC LOGAN CHUCKLES # They're stringing up the lights # Warm cocoa on cold nights # Oh, you know what that means # They're stocking up the stores # Each year, a little more # Oh, you know what that means # Another year has come and gone # Ever faster, hold on, hmm # They're playing carols everywhere # And the world don't seem to care # Oh, if you're ready or not # But you hear the sound # Of a heart that's homebound # And you know there's Nothing left to say # So you join the crowd # And you sing it out loud # Can't resist the feel of Christmas Day # Of Christmas Day # Still too many things to do # How'd December get here so soon? Oh # Soon, we'll ring in the New Year # Feels like this one just got here Oh # Another season come and gone # Ever faster, hold on, hmm # They're hanging stockings Everywhere # And the world don't seem to care # Oh, if you like it or not # But you hear the sound # Of a heart that's homebound # And you know there's Nothing left to say # So you join the crowd # And you sing it out loud # Can't resist the thrill of Christmas Day # Of Christmas Day # Another year has come and gone # Ever faster, hold on, hmm. # Now it really feels like Christmas. You should sing and play like you used to for everyone. Wow, it's getting late. Come on. I'll drive you. DOG BARKING Will you please let me help? Nope. I've got it. I got two perfectly good hands right here. All good. SHE GRUNTS OK. So... So? What else you been up to? Besides all this wedding planning business. Not much. You seeing anyone? - Really? - What? What, is that a ridiculous question to ask? Yes... No. No. No. It's not. And I'm not. I've been focused on work for the past few years. Besides, there's not a whole lot of options out here. Oh, I find that hard to believe. The Pineview boys used to line up outside your door. Who? Uh, Jacob Jones. He was never into me. And he's married. Jesse Clayton. Mm. Married with two kids. Oh, good for him. Andrew Lynch. He was definitely never into me. - What? - Married. To Mr Michaels. You're making this up. I'm not. I planned all their weddings. HE LAUGHS Wow. Face it, Logan, you're the only guy who ever... Ever what? Done. RACHEL GASPS - Did you see that? - What? That shooting star. The meteor shower must be starting. OWL HOOTING Are you OK? You want my coat or something? No, I'm good. I'm great, actually. I can't remember the last time I just stopped and looked up at the stars. Last time for me was probably with you. Forgot how clear the sky was out here. Aha. Something Pineview has that you can't get in the city. There are a lot of things. Can I ask you something? Shoot. Why bring your prize client to get married in a place that you wrote off years ago? I never wrote it off. Pineview will always be my home. You say that, but... But what? Go ahead, say it. If this is your home, then how on earth could you have left me... ..it, behind? Sorry, I... You broke up with me, Rachel. I had to. Did you? You knew I couldn't leave Pineview. I never said you should. But that was always your plan, Logan. Ever since we were kids, you were gonna get out, you were gonna see the world, you were gonna make a name for yourself. You were so determined and confident and everyone knew you could do it. I wasn't gonna stand in the way of that. You said you never wanted to see me again. I didn't. It hurt too much. I was in love with you. All I wanted to do was conquer the world with you. By your side. And then the one thing happened where I... I couldn't. Then I would have stayed. You told me to leave. Rachel, you broke my heart. I didn't want to. But I wanted you to be all the great, amazing things you were always destined to be. Just because I couldn't leave didn't mean you had to stay too. And that's exactly what you've done. So... So. So I'm glad I got that off my chest. LOGAN CHUCKLES RACHEL CHUCKLES You know, the reason that I never came back to Pineview is because it hurt too much. Knowing that you were still here and didn't want anything to do with me. I just... I couldn't imagine being here and not being with you. But I did come back. I know. With quite the power couple, Mr Manager. No, I mean, before. When your mom passed, my parents told me, and I really wanted to be here for you. So I came back. What? And when I saw you at the service, I... Well, there was a lot going on and I didn't want to make it harder for you, in case I was the last person you wanted to see, so... You were there? How could I not have been? I wish I'd known you were there. That was a long time ago. I know enough time has passed, but... It still hurts? Yes. It's just not what was supposed to happen. It's not the life I would have chosen. Yeah, I know what that's like. I should take you home. ENGINE RUMBLING Hey, look who's here. LOGAN GRUNTS - Hey. - How is that for timing? Hi, Mrs Reynolds, Mr Reynolds. How's your father's back? He'll be fine, thanks to this one here. I was just returning him. And now that I've done that, good night. Nonsense. We haven't seen you in ages. You have to come in for a cup of hot cocoa. Mom. Mm-mm. - What? - Uh, I really should be going. I know you were raised better than to pass when you're offered a cup of hot cocoa. Now your sister won't tell me, but I'm hoping that you know the secret behind that perfect yule log. My roll always cracks. DOORBELL RINGS Rach, what's wrong? It's Logan. - Logan? - I knew it. He still has feelings for you. - No. - No. Worse. DANIELLE: Worse? I have feelings for him! Oh, do you? I don't know what to do. Oh, come here. Sure was nice to have Rachel here tonight. It was. Seeing the two of you together again. I can't remember the last time I saw her smile like that. - Mom. - It's true! I know what you're doing. What am I doing? Is it working? LOGAN CHUCKLES You can leave those to soak overnight. You just need to give them time. Some things just need to be given time. HE SIGHS DANIELLE: If I eat one more bite... Think of the baby. You're right. DANIELLE SIGHS I think more cinnamon next time. Mm. Good to me. Of course it's good, but it can always be better. Rach. Greg and I set our wedding date. - You did? - WHISPERS: No. Oh. Rach, you ready to talk? I'm good. No, sweetie, you're not. You want to tell us what happened? Logan. Yes, that much is clear. What happened with Logan? We decorated a tree. OK. With Maddie. And with Dad. And? And then we sang a song. He got you to sing a song? And then? And then I got a flat tyre driving him home, so we watched the meteor shower and we talked and then we had hot chocolate with his parents. And? And... ..I loved it. I loved it all. It's like he reminded me what... what I used to be like. Who I was. And this is devastating because... Because I don't want to go through that again. It hurt enough the first time he left. Maybe this time he won't leave. No. He's got his whole life outside of Pineview. I'm just setting myself up to be heartbroken again. I can't handle losing people I love. CAROLINE GROANS What's wrong with me? I'm falling for him all over again. Danielle owes me 100 bucks cos you admitted you have feelings for Logan. - What? - Caroline. OK. It was 50 bucks. So what are you going to do now? I... I can't go through it again. I won't. So there's only one thing to do. HORSES WHINNYING - Morning. - Morning. The caterers are running a little behind on their setup, but they'll be ready for our sampling in about 15 minutes. Great, so no rush. That should still give us enough time for me to meet Susan at the dress shop. It's a shame their flight was delayed because I think they would've enjoyed that gluten-free pudding I had Greg prepare for them. Yeah, right, that is a shame. Uh, Rachel, can I ask you something? If you want to change the chicken back to fish, that ship has sailed. No, it's not about the wedding. It's not about fish. It's... It's about last night. - Last night. - Yeah. - Yes. - I just, I felt... I know what you're gonna say. But whatever there was between us is in the past now. And I know that maybe we said some things and maybe we realised some things that we didn't know before, but none of it matters now. - It doesn't? - No. Because you have a whole different life. Elsewhere. And I have my life here. And I'm happy and you're happy. And we don't even know each other, really. Just because we brought up old memories last night doesn't change that fact. Huh. Well, I guess I just wanted you to know that I enjoy having you back in my life... ..and I'd hate to lose that. Well, then it's a good thing that we're planning this wedding together, because after that, maybe it'll be another 10 years before you're back in Pineview again. Shoot. You know what? I should go to the dress shop now. I forgot that Paula wanted to go over something. Why don't you do the tasting without me? I've already tried the whole menu, so it's really just you that has to sign off on everything. Just call me if there are any issues at all. OK? HE SIGHS OK. PAULA SIGHS PAULA: All right. Well? What do we think? Mm. It's not quite right. I think I need something with a little more drama. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, I agree, I agree. Hate it, hate it. Come on, veil me. FINGERS SNAPPING All right, what do you think about this one? Hmm? - Maybe a little less drama. - Yeah, I agree, I agree. - Come on, where's... - Now this is one that I absolutely love. SUSAN GASPS Oh, that is gorgeous. I thought you might like it. Well, darling, you've had your eye on this one for years. Looks just like the one your mother wore. Oh, then I couldn't possibly. I don't think a wedding is in the cards for me any time soon. Sounds like it's meant for you. I'll find another. Don't be silly. It's all yours. Oh. SUSAN SIGHS You know, I don't think my bone structure is right for this. Um, how about that one over there? FINGERS SNAPPING Huh? Yes. - This? - Absolutely. Oh, my goodness. Gorgeous. - Let's try it on. - OK. Someday. OK. Yes. LOGAN SIGHS DOOR OPENS Hi, Beverly. Rachel. I didn't see you there. I didn't mean to scare you. Just taking a break to look up at the stars. How are they tonight? Perfect as ever. Big day tomorrow? - Christmas Eve. - And the rehearsal dinner. Yes. Need help with anything? Thanks, but I think we're all set. I miss her, too. The school isn't the same without her. She was a remarkable woman who was a real light for everyone. And she has a beautiful family. I don't want to ever hurt that. - Beverly... - It's OK, Rachel. I just wanted you to know. Get some rest tonight, and stay warm. You too. - Good night. - Good night. Sarah says Santa likes chocolate milk better. Well, why don't we leave him both just in case? Later. Rach, do you need me to bring anything else tonight? No, that should be it. Done! Beautiful job! You can really tell which ones are Aunt Caroline's. Oh! They all look amazing. OK, little lady. Let's, oh, put this beside the fireplace and make sure it's high enough that Bella can't get to it. You remember last year. Bella left Christmas presents all over the house. OK, I better head out. WHISPERS: Should we tell her? Love you guys. I'll see you soon. Let us know if you need us to bring anything! Will do! It's Christmas Eve. Let's hope for some Christmas magic. Is it warm in here? Warm? Are you feeling all right? Yeah, I think I'm just getting nervous for tomorrow. It's feeling very real now that we're actually here. Again. I mean, this isn't just another photoshoot. This is... the rest of my life. Nerves are totally normal. There isn't a bride I've met that hasn't had butterflies the night before her wedding. Yeah? Yeah. It's amazing what you pulled together so quickly. Thank you. It's just all better than I could have ever imagined. I'm so glad. Sorry we were gone for most of it. But it's all turned out beautifully. You and Logan are quite the dream team. We had... fun. I, um... I should go find out where the sandwiches are. - Will you excuse me? - Mm-hmm. OK. CLEARS THROAT Hmm. Oh, hi! Oh, my gosh, you made it. GLASS CLINKING Hello, everybody. Merry Christmas Eve. GUESTS APPLAUDING We just want to thank everyone for spending their Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with us. I want to introduce my manager and friend, Logan Reynolds. GUESTS APPLAUDING He's the reason we found this beautiful town, and played a big part in making this dream come true. Thank you, Susan. And thank you to the Millers, whose beautiful home we are in tonight, and who made this whole wedding even possible. GUESTS APPLAUDING Now, before we head into long-winded, embarrassing speech territory, we have prepared a little surprise to show our gratitude. So if everyone would stand up and follow me outside for one of Pineview's most cherished Christmas Eve traditions. SUSAN: Mm! OK, if everyone could grab a candle, and then join me around the piano... What are you doing? I know you said it's gonna be too much for you to deal with, but I told my parents you couldn't find the tree... It's not about a tree. Why would you go behind my back and... It was supposed to be a surprise. - Your sisters helped. - They what? How could you? It's wrong. Am I missing something? You have no right to take her tradition and her memory and throw it around like it doesn't matter. - Well... Hold on... - Her tree lighting. It was special. It's not a photo opportunity for you to gain followers for people who have no idea what this season or what this town is really about. Rachel, that is not at all what is happening here. - Isn't it? - No! And honestly, I'm starting to think that maybe it's you who's forgotten what this is all really about. You took a tradition that meant so much to so many people, an entire town, in fact, and you hid it away in some dark closet for years now, because why? Why? Because you might feel something? Excuse me? You've got everyone around here walking on eggshells. Your sisters, your dad. Me. It's Christmas, Rachel. It's time to open up. But how are you gonna embrace all of the love and the family and all the good stuff if you're too busy blocking everyone out? You know, your mother would... Don't! You don't get to march in here out of nowhere after all of these years and presume you know anything about me. Or tell me how to live my life. That's just it, Rachel. Are you living it? Or are you just hiding? CAROLINE: Guys! I'm so sorry, everyone. Susan. Denny. I'm so sorry. I just need to, um... HORSES WHINNYING, HORSES SNORTING Hey, Miss P. SHE CHUCKLES Let's give you a curry. SHE CHUCKLES SHE SIGHS DOOR OPENS You got room for one more? Where's Beverly? I told her it'd be best if she didn't come. - Dad... - Out of respect for you. You didn't have to do that. I didn't mean to hurt you... or Beverly. It's hard to see you with someone else, it's hard to see you living your life with someone who... Is not your mother? - Yes. - Ah. Beverly will never take the place of your mother. I know. I know. And we all love Beverly. But you could have at least given me a warning. Just a heads-up, like, "Hey, Rach, guess what? I'm dating." Yeah, I recognise that now. HE INHALES It's strange to see you with someone other than her. Strange for you? What do you think it's like for me? Your mother and I did everything together. I didn't know there was any other way. And then there I was, on a first date for the first time in 40 years. I was a nervous wreck. BOTH CHUCKLING Right up until the moment that Beverly walked through the door. Then, it was like I was 17 again. CHUCKLES The years have come and gone and taken a little bit of my hair and spread my waist a bit, but... all that just melted away. We were just two people, sharing a meal, telling stories, connecting, connecting in a way that I hadn't felt in a long time. Not since we lost your mother. It felt good. It felt good to be seen again. Dad. Look, there's no rule book. No amount of time that's too long or too short. But at some point, you realise that life is short and I wasn't gonna let the years just drift on by. Not when I know just how precious they really are. I'm sorry I made things harder. And I owe Beverly an apology too. I have nothing against her, I just... I miss Mom. Yeah, I miss her too. HE CLEARS THROAT And I want you to be happy. Well, I'm happy when my children are happy. When I can look in their eyes and see that they are all right. And, honey, you're not all right. Why don't you tell me what's going on? Why aren't you over at the dinner? I really messed things up. I think all this time, I was afraid that if we did Mom's traditions without her, it would mean she was really gone. And that we'd actually have to say goodbye. But I see now that it's really the opposite. Will you come with me? Is that what I think it is? Where is everyone? Where's Logan? He left with Susan and Denny. I really screwed things up, didn't I? Yeah, it wasn't the best. I'm sorry, guys. We're sorry too. We know how you feel about Mom's Christmas and we were just trying to... - And you guys are right. We should keep her tradition and her music and her memory alive. We should celebrate her... the way she always celebrated Christmas. The way she celebrated us being a family. I'd forgotten what it was all really about. "Family isn't seen with the eyes, it's seen with the heart." And mine was so broken, I haven't been able to see... ..to see what really matters. I'm so sorry that I lost sight of that for so long. Mm! DANIELLE CHUCKLES Wait, wait. Takes me longer. DANIELLE AND CAROLINE LAUGHING Mm. I'm hoping there's still time. You think anyone would be down for a Christmas Eve lighting ceremony? Yeah. DANIELLE LAUGHS CAROLINE LAUGHS Mm. RACHEL SIGHS GENTLE PIANO MUSIC # Feel it in the air # There's magic at this Special time of year # And it rings out clear # The message to remember Why we're here # Love will lead us # When it's Christmas # Something in the snow # Erases all our fears And calls us home # Every year, we grow # But we keep it in our hearts Where e'er we go # Love will lead us # When it's Christmas # So we light our tree # For a brighter tomorrow For you and me # We've got all we need # When we open up our hearts So we can see # Love will lead us # When it's Christmas # Love will lead us # When it's Christmas # Forever we will be # Just like the evergreens # Always unwavering # Oh, oh. # It's perfect. It is, isn't it? It's Christmas! And a little bit of Christmas cheer for you. And a dash for you and you. And thank you. There's more where that came from. - More? - More! CAROLINE LAUGHS This is fun. Maybe we should have a Christmas wedding. Maybe we should. Merry Christmas, Mr Miller. Merry Christmas, Miss Lane. I thought you could use a little warming up. Don't mind if I do. JAMES CHUCKLES Mom, Dad, Santa's got me exactly what I wanted! Good work, Santa. Merry Christmas, Aunt Rachel! Thanks for the presents. You are so welcome. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Dani. - Mm! - Ron. - Merry Christmas. What can I do to help? More candles, everywhere. I'm on it. Hey, Maddie. I could use your help for a second. Thank you. Danielle, have the rest of the flowers arrived yet? - Not yet. - OK. Oh, my gosh, that looks incredible! Thank you so much, you guys! Just wait until you taste it. RACHEL GASPS Dad, Beverly. You really don't have to do that. Well, we wanted to, sweetheart. Wait, these aren't the cards I had printed. These are hand-written. Beverly did that. Just a little something extra for the big day. These are beautiful. They're absolutely gorgeous. Thank you. Both of you. Beverly, I am so sorry. You don't need to say anything. No, I do. I was awful to you and you didn't deserve that. You have been nothing but kind and generous and a loving member of our family. It was me that was hurting us, not you. Thank you for being there for my father when I wasn't able to be. Merry Christmas. BOTH CHUCKLING SHE SIGHS Susan. You don't have to be here until 10. Is everything OK? I have a little announcement. What's going on? I called off the wedding. What? I can't get married today. Oh, Susan, I am sure it's just nerves. - I see this with all kinds... - It's not just nerves. It's you, actually. Me? And Logan. About last night, I am so, so sorry. I... Don't be. It's exactly what I needed. I was in a rush to tie the knot with Denny because of our goal to hit two million, and I didn't want Morgan Squared to beat us to the punch. I knew our Christmas wedding photos would be so much better than their spring ones, hashtag Yuletide the Knot... ..but I wasn't thinking about what it actually all means. Seeing you and Logan last night, I just... I realised that that's what real love is. I'm sorry, what? The obvious passion between you two. How invested he is in you and your family. How electric you are with each other, even in an argument. I want that. And maybe Denny and I will have that one day. But... But we're not there yet. Susan, I'm so... Don't worry. Denny's totally on the same page. And when we're actually ready, if we're ever ready, I'll call you for spectacular wedding part two. It's all paid for, so don't worry about that. Oh, and also... It's a little Christmas gift. From us. Thank you for everything. Oh. Thank you so much. You didn't have to... I don't know what to say. Well, open it. For your someday. - And then she left. - Just like that? Just like that. It really is a different world out there, isn't it? RACHEL SIGHS Logan. I'm so sorry about Susan. - She just left. - I know. I'm sorry too. You worked so hard on everything. So did you. And I'm sorry about last night. I'm not. Being back here with you, it just... I don't know. HE CHUCKLES You remember when I said that Pineview was home to me? OK, well, I'm starting to realise that it's not just Pineview, it's you. You're home to me. - Logan... - I mean it. - Logan, we can't. - Why? Why can't we? Because my life is here. Then my life is here now, too. - You don't mean that. - I do. I do mean it. Rachel, I've already had the dream life. Whatever that is. You know, the one we always talked about when we were kids. The big house and the big career and the big life. Well, guess what, it looked great in pictures, but it was empty compared to this. Compared to what we had. Compared to what I am hoping we still might have. The real dream has always been you, Rachel. - Logan... - I'm sorry that I left. I'm sorry that I hurt you. I'm sorry that I ever made you think that anything could matter to me more than you. Because nothing does. I choose you, Rachel. "Like it or not." Now please tell me you feel the same way. Logan, I... - I... - Just say "I do!" I... GROUP CHEERING I'm so sorry. What was it that you were gonna tell me? I... GROUP CHEERING Maddie, don't! You'll ruin the cake. Oh, what's the harm? The wedding's off. Someone should enjoy it. What a shame. It's all so beautiful. You did a great job, Rachel. We all did. Like this. I want our wedding to be just like this. A soon as you set a date, I'm on it. I actually have a date in mind. If Greg says yes. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I think I could be thinking what you're thinking. CAROLINE LAUGHS By the power vested in me, by the city of Pineview, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride. GUESTS CHEERING Merry Christmas, Rachel. Merry Christmas. GUESTS CONTINUE CHEERING LIVELY MUSIC Kick my tyres and change my oil. You are a good-looking groom. RACHEL AND LOGAN: Oh, no. Oh, yes. LAUGHS I know a good-looking groom, Rachel. Thank you, Santa Claus! LAUGHS So I'm glad I got Lasik. CHUCKLES It was a Groupon, so you're blurry, but it's still fun. CREW LAUGHING Call your mother. I want to thank her. You are a good-looking groom. Mm? RACHEL AND LOGAN: Oh, no. RACHEL: He's not the groom. Oh, shoot. You the FedEx guy? Don't bite him, Paula! CHUCKLES I have to tell myself not to bite things that look so delicious. You are a good-looking groom. Marcy, I need snacks! This is gonna be a long one. # Oh, holy day... # It comes with sequined pants as well. Well, let's get them out here. Marcy, get the pants! CHUCKLES PAULA CLAPPING I hand-bedazzled this all myself. Nobody asked me to. I just did it. CREW LAUGHING # You're top of my wishlist # Don't want to miss this # So, baby, with this kiss # I do # Feels like it's Christmas # When I'm with you, yeah. #
