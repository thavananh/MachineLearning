foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Malaysia is home to the largest Tamilian population outside Tamil Nadu. The Tamilians here are a minority nonetheless. Despite the huge Tamilian influence, the way Malaysians communicate, their food, their beliefs, cultures, traditions, temple celebrations, as well as their politics, differ in many ways. I started documenting all their interesting stories. Particularly, the paranormal ones. This is Nathan. He's a local friend. I just tell him about the type of stories I’m looking for. And he finds the right people to talk to… and takes me to them. Shankar, I've reached the place you asked me to. There's a board here that says "For Sale". Are you sure I'm at the right address? Where? Behind? Alright, I'll be there. Welcome, sir. How are you? -Good. -It's actually difficult to find this place, but you managed to get here. -Yeah. -How is Nathan? He is good. It's been a while since I last saw him. Come on in. What place is this? This is a store. We were facing some problems in our house so we decided to move here. Come in. Do all of these things belong to you? Actually, they belong to my cousin, Anbu. I’m just taking care of it. Can I take a picture of them? Sure, sir. How did he manage to collect so many things? He has been collecting these things for generations. Buying these rare old things and storing them has been his habit. Come, sir. Careful Mind your head. If anything in here breaks, I'll be dead. I know this house is all over the place, but try and make yourself at home. If I ever win the lottery, the first thing I'll do is renovate this place. My dream is to build an amazing balcony and adopt two dogs. Come on in. Be careful, don't hit your head. Do people still buy these things? No, sir. They come here, ask for the price and then leave. Instead of selling these things, we end up buying more. These are pure treasures. Treasures? This is nothing but rubbish! One man's trash is another man's treasure. What? Nothing. I have to be frank. Can I charge this? Yeah sure. Let me help you. If you don't mind, may I record you? That's not a problem, sir. Start by telling me your name and your age. My name is Shankar. I am 34 years old. The story you're going to talk about… did you hear it from someone else or did you experience it yourself? Have you ever heard of a game named "Spirit of the Coin"? The game that uses an "Ouija board" to communicate with ghosts? About six months ago, Guru, Anbu and myself… happened to play that game. Hey, Shankar. Why can't we just use a normal coin? Old coins have more power. Find one. Make sure you keep the coin in the same place you took it from. I've put in a lot of effort to collect them. There it is, Shankar. I drew what you asked me to. Check if it's right. Hey, you can't even write alphabets correctly? What are those scribbles all over? Never mind, write down the numbers. Look at this. It's from the year 1987. Is this okay? -Hey. -What? -Find a coin that's much older. -Right. Here, this is from the year 1971. Look at this. I don't think there's any other coin that's much older than this. Let's just play with this one. Alright then. Come on. Let's play. Alright, listen to me carefully. Once you’ve placed your finger on the board, you cannot lift it until the game is over. What do you mean can't lift it?! What shall I do if I need to use the restroom? Should I just soil my pants? -You carry on with the game. -Hey, hold on! -Hey! -Yes? Get your adult diaper and let him wear it. -I wear an "M" size, but he is an "L". -It's "XL". Look! Alright, listen. Once a spirit is invited, we must make sure that they're sent back correctly. If not, there will be consequences. And you chose to say this now? Your friends have played this before, right? Did a spirit appear? Did the spirit speak? Did anything happen? It worked with them. So, listen to me carefully. Place your finger here. Hey, you don't have to apply so much pressure. Spirit, spirit of the coin. Spirit, spirit of the coin. If anyone is here, please communicate with us. Spirit, spirit of the coin! Spirit, spirit of the coin! Please give us a sign. Hey! The ghost will definitely run away. Call out to it in Tamil. If I knew how to invite a ghost in Tamil, I would, right? Let's wait for a while. Hey! Hey, how much longer should we keep doing this? There isn't a single sign of anything. I did everything that was mentioned in here. Hey, should I lift my finger or not? Lift it. I don't understand why the ghost isn't appearing. I followed all of the instructions properly. ORIGIN OF SPIRIT OF THE COIN Hey, what if we play the game at a cemetery or a place where a huge number of people have died before? I've heard that the power is greater there. Wait, you don't have to do anything as such. Find an alternative way to do this. -If not, I have an idea. -What is it? If one of us can place a drop of blood on this board the chances of us inviting a ghost in here are higher. What?! -Blood makes me queasy -Hey, calm down. Whose idea was it to talk to the ghost? Him, right? You place a drop of blood. Okay. Alright. I will. They have trapped me in this. Place your finger here. On the blood? No, in your urine! Spirit, spirit of the coin! Spirit, spirit of the coin! If anyone is here, please communicate with us. If you are here, please come. Hey, who moved the coin? -It wasn't me. -Hey, the coin moved to "Yes". If someone is really here, can you please tell us your name? What's your name? Sapaghanamava! K. E. N. -E. -KENE? D. Y. Kenedy! It's a foreigner's spirit. Is this really a spirit or is this one of your doings? Hey! I will bash you up. I said I didn't do it. Alright, go ahead and ask something. Let's see if the ghost answers then. Hey, listen. Ask for my date of birth. We already know when your birthday is. -Try and ask it something else. -Ask for my father's name. -Go ahead and ask your wife's name! -Hey, hold on. Wait, Shankar. Let the ghost try and figure out my great-grandfather’s name. Yeah. That's better. Kenedy, can you tell us the name of Guru's great-grandfather? Hey, I think it doesn't understand Tamil, try asking the same English. Okay, Kenedy. Can you please tell us the name of Guru's great-grandfather? A. N. I. R. U… Anirudh! Is your great-grandfather's name, Anirudh? No. His name is Danush. -What? -Hey, I am the foreigner here. There is no spirit here. I was just fooling around with you guys. And you're still believing his words? Hey! Are you insane? Calm down. I really thought there was a ghost here! You made me paranoid. You need not play with us. Go! Get out! Shut up! Increase the fan's speed. Ask the ghost to turn it on. He made me paranoid. Brother, do you have an older coin? I think this will work if we use a coin that's much older. Is it? Hold on. Shankar, I'm not sure about how old this coin is but this is the oldest coin I've ever bought. -Shall we play with this? -Bring it. Here it is. Hey, this coin looks really old. Let's try playing with it. Alright, come on. Aren't you putting some blood on it? Sure. I'll put some blood. Drop some more. Hold on. This isn't chili sauce. It won't start falling out as soon as we apply pressure. Place your finger here, brother. Shankar, make sure you invite a pretty female ghost. It'll make the game more interesting. Hey, you're a coward! So you better shut up. Hey, don't you forget the rules of the game. Spirit, spirit of the coin! Spirit, spirit of the coin! If there's anybody here, please give us a sign. Spirit, spirit of the coin! Please communicate with us. Shankar, the coin is getting warm. Make sure you don't lift your finger. What is happening? Look at what it's trying to spell. W… X… Q… It keeps going around the same alphabets. I don't understand what's happening. Hey, you guys. Be careful. It looks like the spirit is an alcoholic. Don't let it get you. Hey, get here and bring a pen and a piece of paper along. Why should I? You called me a coward earlier, right? Hey, just be quick and get what I asked you to. Hold on. Hey, this is really scaring me. Same here. Calm down. Here you go. Hey, you just concentrate on the coin and draw what it's trying to say. -Here, draw it yourself. -Come on, please draw it for me. Please. I really need you to help me draw it. What is it saying? What does this mean? A goal post? Turn it the other way around. Could it possibly be the Tamil alphabet, "Pa"? The coin stopped moving. I'm sure it's "Pa". It's moving again. Hey, try and draw the movement of the coin. What does this mean? Here. Is this the alphabet "La"? It stopped. It's moving again. Draw it. NI What does this mean? It says "Palani". Since we are not that fluent in English, it's communicating with us in Tamil. Maybe, "Palani" could be the name of the spirit? Hey! Palani is the name of my great-grandfather. What are you saying? Look, don’t get me wrong. But, did the spirit really communicate in Tamil? Yes. At first, we couldn't believe it either. Where did you play the game? At that house. Oh, okay. What happened after that? Stop fooling around you guys. Which one of you is doing this? How did you guess the name? We asked your grandmother! Hey, we don’t even know what your grandfather’s name is. How are we supposed to know what your great-grandfather’s name is? Nonsense! Hey, could you please do me a favor? Could you get some chili powder or flour from the kitchen? Guru, just listen to him. Go. Here, this is all I got. I brought coffee powder. That'll do. Sprinkle some of it here. -Where? -Right here. Okay, that's enough! Spirit, if there really is someone here, I am sure you have a name. Can you please tell us your name? Hey, draw it. Ma… li… Write "Kha". It's "Ka" not "Kha". Malika. It's a woman's name. Malika. Malika, can you tell us the reason behind your death? Drow… ni… ng. Drowning? I guess she drowned to death. Drowned?! Malika, how old are you now? She is 23 years old. Hey, you asked for a female spirit, right? Here, you've got a female spirit. Malika, when did you pass away? In the year 2010. Malika, can you tell us where did you pass away? Riv… er. A river. Where were you when during that time? U. U. M. I don't understand. I guess this is English and not Tamil. What? "UUM". What is 'UUM'? Could it be "Universiti Utara Malaysia"? The universiti? So, you were studying at UUM? Yes. In that case, she should know English. Why is it communicating in Tamil? That's my wish! You deserved that. Fine. If you are a real ghost, give us a sign. Careful! The coin moved by itself, right? -What sign do you want now? -Don't lie. I don't believe this. I'm sure this is one of your doings. Hey, I am going to curse you! Alright, if she can tell me my great-grandfather's name, ask her to tell me something else as well! That's when I will believe that it's a real spirit. If she doesn't, I'll be 100% sure this is your doing. Okay. I'm sure that this isn't your doing and you know this isn't me, right? You're the only one who wants to know, right? Malika, can you tell Anbu and me a secret that we don't know about but only Guru knows? Should I tell them about what you did with a girl in this house? Hey, what did you do with a girl in this house? And how did you do it in my house without my knowledge? Malika, what is the girl's name? Hey! Why did you spill it all over? You were the one who didn't believe it. Now that your secrets are being revealed, you're freaking out. Enough! I'm not afraid. Do you really want me to bash you up? Stop making me paranoid! I cannot believe this. Was it truly Malika's spirit… or were you guys just playing? No, we weren't fooling around. Did you continue playing the game even after that? Shankar, we played the game earlier, we talked to the spirit and according to the rules we shouldn't have lifted our fingers just like that. You said there would be consequences if we did so, right? Yes. When we were playing earlier, we lifted our fingers just like that. Will the spirit do anything to us? Yes. Tonight we will die! Hey! Relax! I'm just kidding! -Don't be scared and go back to sleep. -You don't even know when to make a joke. Alright. Please wake up early tomorrow. Shankar… you will never walk forever. Which girl did he bring home? What did he do with her? Go to sleep. How did he get the keys to my house? Come to me. Come closer. More close. Shankar! Do you want me? Hey, you! Hey! Wake up. It's late. Sir, how much can you pay for this? Ask him. -How much will you pay for this? -Give it here. Let me see. Hey, look at it carefully. Sir, both of these coins are not worth that much. I can buy this one for 20 ringgits. Can you pay a bit more? That's my final offer. -Will you buy it? -Yes, I will. Here, write your name, address and your contact number in this book. Why? I don't wanna be in trouble if you're a thief and this is stolen. Here you go. How much is this for? Do you want to buy it? No, right? Go. Thank you. Can't you be respectful to the customers? You're calling him a customer? He doesn't have any money and that's why he sells old coins. Do you think he can afford to buy these coins? Everyone opens a shop to sell their items. You're the only one who has opened a shop to buy items. You won't understand its value now. How long are you going to stay single? Don't you want to get married again? Just admit that it's getting difficult for you to look after me. I can stand on my own feet. You don't have legs, and you're talking about standing on your own feet. Go away! You can get 300 ringgits every month if you apply for welfare. Want me to do it for you? A person must be mentally ill or disabled to be eligible for welfare. Do you think I'm disabled? Aren't you? Don't piss me off. If you don't want the money you can give it to me instead. I can use it to cover my expenses. That thought is exactly what makes you a disabled person. It’s my fault that I felt sorry for you. You didn't feel sorry. You're just being selfish. Shut up. DROWNING CASE 2010 MALLIKA DROWNED TO DEATH 2010 Shankar! Look at this picture. Hey! Who's this? She looks like an actress. That's Malika. Is it? What do you mean? Who's that man besides her? Where did you get this from? I surfed the internet to find out whether yesterday’s incidents were true or not. I searched through Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as well. There were thousands of girls by the name Malika. Then, I found this photograph in an old UUM blog. In the year 2010, a guy named Deepak posted this. This photo of Malika is of when she studied there. So she definitely must have graduated in the next following years. I saw all of their graduation photos. In the year 2012, all of her friends graduated. But she wasn't there in any of the photographs. Why? I don't know. I'm assuming she must have dropped out of college or she had a fight with her friends and did not want to take a picture. What a genius you are! When we played the game yesterday, Malika said she passed away in 2010, right? Hey, you said you didn't believe this, right? Now, I believe it. But, I must investigate how Malika died. Are you the CID or something that you want to investigate this? She looks really familiar. Hey, how about we play the game again tonight? Let's play it now. Actually, there's a lucky draw today. I need to go get the lottery ticket first. -See you later. -Alright then. Do you still have her photo? Can I have a look at it? The photo is still at the house. Alright, what happened next? Money is… God Even God Knows it to Money is God Even God knows it too -Oh no! -What happened? Since I am with you, your bad luck is following me everywhere. Why so? I didn't win the lottery today. -Your time of birth is not right. -Shankar. Yes? How many times have I asked you to not put your slippers here? -Hey. -Yes? -Check this out! -I'll throw it out! This will make our job easier. Hey! Where did you get this from? I found it stuck on one of my cupboards at home. Since no one is using it I brought it here. It will be useful to us. Alright, go get the coin. Hold on. Okay, put your finger here. Wait, you haven't put your blood. Place your finger now. -Malika, -Lord Muniswaran! if you are here, can you speak to us? Actually, Malika, we have many questions for you. Malika, can you confirm if it is you in this photo? Malika, you are really beautiful. Malika. Was it you who appeared in my dream last night? Hey, calm down. Malika, how did you drown in the river? Bet… Write it down. …ra… yal. Betrayal. If betrayal is the reason, I'm sure it's a relationship problem. Were you in love with someone? Did you guys break up? I was betrayed by someone. Fantastic! Malika, we will get cheated if we trust people blindly. Hey, why are you looking at me? Shut up. Malika, if you were alive right now, who would you choose among the three of us? Hey! Why? Do you want to get married? An… bu. Anbu! She chose me. Don't get overexcited now, enough. Malika, you said that you drowned right? Can you tell us where? A river that can't be seen. Can't be seen? Where is that river? Do you want to drown too? She just mocked you, dude. Malika, are you still a virgin? You are asking unrelated questions. Why? Ask different questions. Malika, I've heard that spirits have unachieved desires. Do you happen to have any desires? Re… ven… ge. Revenge! You want revenge? From who? Your boyfriend? Malika, just tell us his name and we will bash him up! Time… will… come. Time will come. Alright, it's up to you. Malika, can you tell us about our future? It's dark. We already knew that! Can you tell us something else? Have you ever regretted your death? Actually, tell us who will win the elections this year. Can you tell me the name of my future girlfriend? Can you appear in my dreams tonight? Do you have a sister? Do ghosts feel sleepy? Does God exist? Throughout the night, we spoke to Malika. We didn't even realize how much time had passed. Can we ask a question that will be useful to Malika? Useful? What do you want to ask? -Look, we do not have enough money. -Right. -That's why I want to ask for her help. -Yes, okay. Go ahead. Give her your account number and she will deposit some money in it. No, dude. I meant, we could ask her the lottery numbers and try our luck. What if we win the jackpot? We will live happily forever. -He's right. -Is it? Malika, can you give us a four-digit number so that we could win the lottery and get our lives settled once and for all? You can? So, tell us, Malika. What will I get in return? Look, Malika, you can ask for anything you want and we'll give it to you. A "two-legged animal"? By a two-legged animal does she mean she wants Biryani with two chicken thighs? Wait. She meant a two-legged animal. Duck or chicken? We can provide it. Malika, if you could give us a lottery number that will help us win one million ringgit, we will get you an entire chicken farm. -"Keep your promises!" -Hey! She is asking for the unfamiliar and you guys want to provide it. This isn't right. Guru, pity her. She must have wanted it when she was alive. It's a small matter. We can provide it. So, you want to sacrifice a goat and give it to her? It is fine until you wanted to play this game, but now, you guys are taking it way too far. Hey, -she just wants to help us. -Yeah. Promise… me. I will give you the numbers. -Malika, I'm sure-- -Hey! Today she's asked for this, who knows what will she ask for later. I am nicely asking you guys to end this right now! Hey! -Why do you always create havoc? -Yeah. You wanna see-- You're showing off only because your friends are with you, right? What is the meaning of Thoppan and Chokkan? Malika, I don't understand. -What is Thoppan and Chokkan? -Hey! Keep this. You're not listening to me. I'll throw hot water on your face. That's when you'll understand. What's wrong with him? He seems to be very angry! He definitely will throw hot water on us. We'll talk later. Bye. A river that can't be seen? Where's the river? Revenge? Two-legged animal? You want to show off because your friends are with you, right? Was Guru here this morning? I don't know. I think he came back last night. I’m calling him since morning but he is not answering. I’ll go and search for him. -Hey! -Yes. Chase the cat away. It's littering up the whole place. You're not the one cleaning up the mess I am. I can't even clean your mess and you're expecting me to clean your cat's mess! Hey. Hey! Why won't you answer my calls? I've been looking for you everywhere. Get me a bottle. Auntie, one bottle, please! What happened? Are you angry? I'm extremely broke. What would I do? I’ve pawned all my mother’s and sister’s jewelry. A couple of them have been overdue for two months now. I won't be able to go home until I retrieve those. I wanted to become a taxi driver but the Grab and Uber have taken over. My lorry license has expired too. I can’t drive the lorry either. What other option do I have? You are okay. At least you are able to pay Anbu every month. But me, I'm just a parasite here. How long should I live like this? That is why I asked for the lottery numbers from Malika so I could settle down in life. Do you have money for that? Okay, let's go back. Drink. I'm not coming, you go ahead. What's your problem? You said you had a dream about Malika yesterday, right? What did she do? Why? Did you dream about her too? You had a good time, is it? Tell me. I thought you are the one who would be in action, but you're saying that she strangled you? Was it only strangling or did she do something else too? What is this? -This is Malika's hair. -Hey! What do you mean? This isn’t Malika's spirit. This is something else. Stop talking nonsense! You are the one who said she's Malika. But you're declining it now. What do you mean? I had my suspicions when she said out my ancestor’s names. And now, she's talking about Thoppan and Chokkan. Do you know what that means? Since Lord Ganesha has a big belly, my grandmother would address him as Thoppan. In Madurai, Lord Shiva is addressed by another name, Chokkan. Both of these Gods have been worshiped by my family for generations. How does she know that we worship them? And now, she's asking for a two-legged animal. This isn’t Malika. This is something else. Hey, finish your drink and let's go. If you don't wanna play this game again it's fine with me! Just ask for two more bottles and we can leave. I don't want to come along. Alright! We can head back after drinking four more bottles. Order it. Anbu! Open the door. I'm coming. Let's talk to her for the last time. Don't be scared. Calm down. Don't be scared. Relax. Hey, Anbu! Get the coin. Get the chart with the alphabets as well. We will speak to Malika today. She strangled my friend in his dream. How dare she! I will strangle you today. Watch out! After today, we will not play this anymore. But I must call Malika and speak to her today. Only then, I will be satisfied! Hey, hold on! There's the needle. You are very alert. My friend! I won’t rest till you get justice! I had a sweet dream but my friend had a nightmare. Anbu, get up here! I need your help. Guru, switch on the fan. Move the table to that side. Help me move the table. Come on. Move it, man! I've been sacrificing my blood all this time. Come on you guys. Put your finger here. What? Put your finger here. Malika, are you here? You appeared in my dreams and it was fine, but why did you disturb Guru in his dream? Malika, whatever it is, we can talk it over. -No problem. -Hey! Who are you? Would you want me to confront and tell? Do you want to get us scared? Do you think we will get scared? Talk to us. Come on. Hey! Shut up. What if she appears? Malika, we are just talking, okay? Tell me. What do you want? A two-legged animal. If we let her, she will continue demanding and talking like this! Ask her to talk now! What are you doing? Move your leg! I won't! I want to talk to her face-to-face. This is not right, Guru. Move your leg. Shut up. I'm scared. Move your leg. You coward! Can't you shut up? Hey! I asked you to move your leg, move it! "Death will arrive soon". -Meaning? -Hey! She said she wants to kill. Who? Hey, ask her to kill someone now! -This is absurd! -Hey! Why are you doing this?! Hey! Go to hell! Guru threw the coin away despite our warning. We slept off because we were drunk. Anbu! Hey, Guru! Guru! Hey! Wake up, Guru! Wake up, Guru! Guru! Wake up! -Guru? -Wake up, Guru! Call the ambulance! Everyone said Guru slipped and died because he was drunk. The forensic report too declared that he was drunk. But only Anbu and I knew that it was Malika who caused Guru's death. How sure are you that it's Malika who did it? Guru’s death could have been an accident too, right? I want to tell you something Anbu doesn't know. The day Guru died, When I went to pick him up… Guru, wake up! After that incident, we didn't wanna stay in that house anymore. The coin is still there. What about Anbu? After Guru's death, he got the chart and kept saying Malika is the reason Guru died. Hey, if it's okay can I have a look at the coin? Sir, why are you putting things at risk? It has already cost a life. I have written many stories like this. Look at this. This is the magazine I write in. LAND OF THE DEAD MONTHLY MAGAZINE I'm currently writing about paranormal incidents in this magazine. SPIRIT RESEARCH CENTER And that is why I thought of putting your story in here too. Normally when we write these stories, the victims will tell us their incidents. We don't get any pictures related to it. We just take what’s on the internet and put it in our magazine. Few will recognize it as fake just by looking at it. So, it would be better if I could get the picture of the coin, Malika and the scene as well. This will definitely make the article more interesting. So you're going to publish a picture of me? No. If you don't want it, we won't publish it. I must think about this first. -Here take this. -I do not want the money. It's okay, keep it. -Keep it. -I don't want it. You can use it for your expenses. Thank you, sir. Can we go there now? Sure. But can we go at night? There are some loan sharks looking for me. "Loan Sharks"?! I mean close friends. Hold this. Come on. We are struggling to sell this house but there are no buyers yet. Sorry, there's no electricity. Can I have a look at Malika's photo? Yeah, sure. That's Malika? Yes. Where did Guru die? Over there! You don't want to follow? No. You may go. I'll wait here. Where's the coin? It's in the corner. Do you know what currency this is? No idea. This looks like the currency from my country. But, I don't understand what's written here. Where did you get this coin? Follow me. Anbu pulled this coin out of his coin catalog. Here it is. He bought all these coins? Yes, sir. This one's empty. Let me see it. Sir… I think this is the coin Anbu had used. Do you know who he bought this coin from? Whenever he buys something, he makes a note of it in a notebook. But I'm not sure if the book's here. Here it is. But this book only has entries for the year 2008. This book has entries from 2009 and 2010. Year 2010… Deepak. It says "Deepak". Sir! Look at this picture. It says "Deepak" as well. Deepak posted this photo in the year 2010. He bought the coin in 2010 as well. Malika, when did you die? Sir. Malika told us that she died in the year 2010. So, you got the coin in the same year that Malika died. It was sold by someone… who was related to Malika. Deepak. If we find Deepak, we will know who's Malika… and we can decode the mystery of her death. Sir, the address shows that he is from Penang. We have his contact details. Should I try contacting him? Please reload to continue your service. Goodbye! Sir, I can't get through. Maybe he changed his number. Can we go to his house? Shankar! When Shankar was telling the story I did not believe it. Is it Malika? I don't know for sure. But there's a connection between the coin and Malika. We must find out the cause of Malika's death. We will know the story if we can locate Deepak. Promise me that you won't play this game again. Anbu, why would I want to play this game again? Is Penang far from here? Not very far. It's about an hour away. If that's the case, let's go there. Sure, but I only own a motorcycle. We'll ride on the motorcycle then. We can go, but I don't have road tax. Can we go by train? I want to come too. You too? Why? It's difficult for you. You tell me if it's difficult for you. Mom, I will send a picture of a coin. Can you show it to Dad and get some information about it? Sir, which part of Tamil Nadu are you from? From Madurai. Is it? They are so crude on Tamil films? We are caring actually. Madurai is one of the cities which still preserves its own culture and tradition. There are two reasons they do it. Firstly, a bullfight. You definitely know the struggles of a bullfight in Alanganur. The protest for bull taming. Secondly, the Chittirai celebration. It is celebrated with great unity among the people that stay there. The people of Madurai are very hardworking. You should visit Madurai sometime. Sure. I heard that Deepak stays in this condo. Yes? Hey, who's that guy besides her? You are Deepak, right? Yes. Who are you? Do you remember selling this coin to him? What? You know Malika, right? Actually, we would like to know how Malika died. Who are you? -Sir. -What happened? Why is he so rude? Malika? Who are you? Do you know anything about this coin? How did you get this coin? Can we talk inside? Please come in. I'm so sorry for your loss. I did not expect this to happen. I want to know how my friend died. What's the relationship between you and this coin? I was in my second year of college. I stayed in a hostel while I was studying at UUM. Saro was my roommate. We visited Muzium Lembah Bujang once. I saw many archaeological findings there. I noticed the Indian influences of the olden days. I was very interested in archaeology. So, I joined a part-time archaeology course there. LONGGOKAN TUYERE One day, they took us to a paddy field for an archaeology assignment. The workers there said that they always find antique items in the field. We started to excavate there. We found a few artifacts there. While we were excavating, I found this spot. Dear, get the water. What are you staring at? Auntie, why is the soil like this? The soil is not yet fertile. If we plant the paddy now, it won't grow. Come on, let's go there. Okay. It is not advisable to be here alone. I found this coin there. After a few days… Whenever Saro wasn’t in the room… I felt someone's presence in the room. But, when I closely observed, there would be nothing. -See you. -See you. -Bye. -Bye. Bye. That's all? Nothing else. -Nothing else? -Nothing happened there! You seem to be very happy although nothing happened. -What is it? -There are marks on your neck. -What is it? -Love bites. What? Don't pretend as if you don't know. There is nothing. There were spots on my neck and my back as well. There are love bites on her neck but when asked, she denies it. Enjoy it! -Tonight is going to be fun. -Yes. I felt that something wasn't right. I tried telling Saro about it, but she never took it seriously. One night Saro and I stopped by the market. Hey, that man is calling you. Me? There was an old man there who asked me to meet him. Uncle, you called me? Do you know me? May I know why you called me? Uncle! Uncle? I see an entity behind you. What? Uncle, I don't see anything. I see a black entity behind you. I think you are in great danger. Meet me at the temple tomorrow. -Okay. -What happened Malika? Nothing. Let's go. I did not take his words seriously. -Surprise! -Surprise! -Happy birthday to Saro! -Happy birthday to Saro! -Happy birthday to you! -Happy birthday to you! We are going to have fun tonight! Come on, let's take a picture. One, two, three, say cheese! While Saro was busy clicking photos, I saw something. I saw a black figure behind me. I remembered the old man's words. That night, I dozed off. I kept hearing noises in my room. Saro! Saro! Saro! Saro! -What's wrong Malika? What happened? -Saro! -Saro, there's something there! -Where? -There's something wrong there, Saro! -Where? -There's something there, Saro? -What are you talking about? -There's something there, Saro! -Where is it? -I saw something down there. -There's nothing down there. There's nothing down there, Malika. -Why are you scaring me? -No, Saro… -There is something, Saro… -Okay. Why are you scaring me? If you are brave, come in front of me. There's nothing there. Don't cry. Malika, open the door! What happened? Why are you screaming? Malika, are you going to open the door or not? Malika! Malika! What's wrong? Malika, wait! After that, I went to the temple to meet the old man. Uncle! Please come. Leave your slippers out and wash your feet before coming in. There's a problem in my hostel. There's no problem in your hostel. There's a problem with you. Have you been to a cemetery or an old house lately? Have you done something unwanted, without permission or disrespectful lately? Has anything as such happened? Try and remember. Have you taken something that is not yours? There's an unsettled spirit following you around. I can't elaborate on what it is. We visited a paddy field for an assignment on Kadaram. I brought back an old coin that I found there. Where's the coin now? It's in my hostel. But, what's the relation between the coin and what's happening? The mere coin that you possess is seen as a soul treasure by the spirit. If I took your belongings without your permission, you would get angry, right? You better return the coin from the place you took it and apologize that you took it. Make sure that you don't go there anymore. Ma'am, don't be afraid. Keep this Velwith you always. Don't worry and go home. I am the one who prays to the father of Suppan. After that, I asked Deepak to return the coin to the field. I didn't even know that Deepak had sold the coin to you. I quit my studies and went back to my hometown. Has anything disturbed you after you returned the coin? -No. -Sir. No? What's the meaning of the "Father of Suppan"? Lord Murugan has one more name, Suppan. That's like the terms Thoppan & Chokkan. The father of Suppan? Lord Murugan's father is Lord Shiva. It is saying that it worships Lord Shiva. Sir, if it's a ghost, why would it say such a thing? What if it's not a ghost? From the moment you took the coin from its place, you got into trouble. Later Deepak sold the coin to them. After seven years, they played the game using the coin. From then on, they got into trouble. It pretended to be Malika with you both, but showed its actual self to Malika. Why did it pretend to be someone else to you? Sir, when we played that day, Guru asked for a pretty female ghost. Could that be the reason? Could be. How old were you in the year 2010? I was 23 years old. When it spoke to you, the whereabouts of Malika were all true. But it lied about Malika's death from drowning in an invisible river. Because only in 2010 Malika discovered the coin. So, what does the invisible river means? Sir, could it be the place where the ghost died? Maybe, it's possible. The invisible river? No. When we were playing "Spirit of the coin", Malika…. I mean… the ghost said that it died in an invisible river. Actually, I took this coin from a river. What? Earlier you said it was a paddy field and now a river? Give me a moment. This is the map of Kedah. During those days it was known as Kadaram. I believe you have heard about it before. This is the current river. This is the sea. The paddy field is located between the two. This is what the river looked like 2000 years ago. The entire area was a sea. So, there was an ancient trade city here. That is why there were frequent visits of sailing ships there. Sailing ships? By sailing ships she means yachts. Yes, yacht. Why so? This was a major hub for iron goods export. "Kadaram" means iron. Arab, China, Thailand and many Indian traders were also here for trading. This place was once invaded by emperor Rajendran Chola. He was known as the Chola who conquered Kadaram. During rainy seasons, there would be muddy puddles right here. Over time, the wide river became narrower and broke into smaller branches. One of it, is this river here. As time passed, these small rivers became shallow and muddy puddles were formed. The "Invisible river". I found the coin from the paddy field which was once a muddy swap. We were communicating with such an old spirit? It pretended to be Malika so you could meet her in real life. Because it's only she who knows the whereabouts of the spirit. It killed your friend Guru who tried to obstruct its quest. Sir, it could have been straightforward with us. There was no need to do this. Whenever we find an answer, a new question rises. The only solution to this is to go to that paddy field. Malika, can you take us there? What are you guys expecting? -Take that coin and get lost! -Deepak, wait. -Wait, cool down. -So much has happened… but you didn't tell me even once? Do you want to invite more problems? Look here, this is your problem. Enough is said. Please get out! My problem? Shankar! -You are the real culprit! -Stop! If you left the coin there, none of this would have happened. -Let me go, Malika -Don't! -Calm down. -Let go, sir! Please don’t do this! Guru wouldn't have died. You better return the coin to the place you took it from! Please calm down. If not, show us the place and I will do it! Stop it, Deepak. Hello, Mom. Muruga, it's Dad. You wanted to know about the coin, right? The coin looks like it's from here and it's ancient. Why do you wanna know about it? It's nothing, Dad. My friend has that coin. He wanted some information about it. Can you tell me which era the coin is from? I'm not so sure of its accurate age but I guess these coins were used during the Pandian era. Pandian era? If you look at the coin, there's a symbol of two fishes. During the Pandian era, the two-fish symbol was really important. -It looks like an arrow mark. -Exactly! Turn it sideways. Okay. There are similar fish symbols on the ancient coins found here. How old do you think this coin really is? It's difficult to guess the accurate age, but many believe it's from the Sangam period that ended around 1800 years ago. What is the symbol on the other side of the coin? It looks like a human holding a trident. Maybe it's a depiction of Lord Shiva or a symbolism of worshiping Lord Shiva. I have seen these symbols on other coins from the Sangam era. But I have never seen a human symbol on a coin before. I feel puzzled too. As far as I know, there are similar coins… used by the indigenous people of the Himalayan regions. They used symbols of God and religious beliefs on their coins. I will try to gather some more information and keep you posted. Thanks, Dad. Don't you have any Tamil songs? It’s alright, turn off the radio! Wait, Deepak. If I’m not mistaken, we were supposed to turn towards the left over there. The paddy field is right there. Hold on. Let me get you the wheelchair. Are you sure about this? I'm the cause of all these problems. I took the coin from here. I'm sorry. I made a mistake. I took the coin without your consent. Are you crazy? We are trespassing here. We will be in big trouble if someone sees us. Malika, let's get out of this place. This doesn't make any sense. Come on. You asked us to show you where we got the coin from and we have shown it. That's it. The rest is up to you. We don’t want to be involved anymore, sorry. Sir, what are you doing? I want to know what is beneath this. What's this, sir? It looks like a piece of iron. Will you help me dig this and look for what’s inside? It’s a skull! There's something else in here. Let's dig. Shankar, what is it? Answer me! What is it? Wait, there is a skull in here! Sir, what is this? An anchor. This is huge! It looks like the symbol on the coin. How did an anchor from the Pandian kingdom end up here? How about this skeleton? This skeleton looks like it has been chained to this anchor. This skeleton should have been rotted by now. Although it's been long, there's no sign of dawn yet. The sky looks weird. Sir, let's get out of here. Shankar! Hey! What are you doing, sir? Tell him, Anbu. He's asking you something. After Guru threw the coin outside the window, how did the coin come back to the house? Guru's death… wasn't caused by a ghost. Tell the truth, Anbu. What do you mean? I don't understand. Please think about it! Why didn't the coin that killed Guru didn't do anything to Malika? After Guru threw the coin away, it came back to the house. Yet it could not find Malika all these years? After seven years, we are the ones who brought it to Malika. Even to reach Malika, it needed our help. That day, it returned to your house with someone's help too. Let it be a spirit, devil or a ghost, but it has its own weakness. At first, I doubted you two. But, while we were at Malika's place, I noticed something. Anbu's eyes were only focused on the coin. Even at your place, he was all focused on the coin. To clear my doubts, I snapped a photo of Anbu. In the picture, Hey! Tell us! Is this your doing? Are you the one who brought the coin here? Did you kill Guru? I did not kill him! I did not kill him! I did not kill him! The other day while you were out looking for Guru, I played the game again so that I could speak with Malika privately. I would like to make a wish. Will you grant it? Just like you wanted your lottery numbers, I asked her to cure my legs. Can you fix my legs and help me walk again? It asked for a two-legged animal. I thought I could provide a duck or a chicken. A human vessel! But, Malika, she asked for a human body. Anbu, open the door. Then both of you entered. We played the game again. During the chaos… What the hell! Guru took the coin and threw it away. On the same night, after both of you dozed off… I went to look for the coin… because I wanted to speak to Malika. Malika, I'm sorry for what they did. Please don't do anything to us. It asked for a human body and promised not to kill us in return. And you believed it!? Hey! Can you live in my shoes even for a day? Tell me. I am living like a vegetable. Every day, even for the smallest tasks, I am dependent on someone else. Only people like me will know the pain of it! You won't be able to apprehend it. I have prayed endlessly for my leg to be healed. But, did God do anything? Malika made me stand for a minute. Look, you got your legs back. After witnessing that, how couldn't I believe it? Do you want me to throw that away? Answer me! Where did it fix your leg? You are still the same! Please restore my legs, Malika. Please get me my legs back! If you want to stand on your feet permanently, reach the dead river bed, find the hidden anchor… and bring the human body there! That's what it said! Where will I even find a human body? Your friends are there. I can't sacrifice my friends. You coward! I have no intention of killing anyone, I want to use it to continue living! Okay, what should I do now? It asked me to release it and set it free. If it asked you to bring the body here, how did Guru die? Did you kill him? I did not do it on purpose! I did not do it on purpose! Hey, you! What are you doing here? How did the coin come back? I just threw it out of the window. -Did you bring it back? -No, Guru. Give it to me. You will get it back only if I throw it here right? -Guru! -No! -Guru, please give it to me. -Let go of my leg! -Guru! -Let go of me! -Please, Guru. -Let me go. The coin was the only way I could cure my legs. -Don't do it, Guru! -You went to get it right? I'll see how you'll pick it up this time! -Don't do it! -Pick it up now! -Pick it! -No! -Move! -No! -Let go of me! -Get lost! Guru! Guru! I accidentally pushed him in order to get the coin. What do you mean? How could you hide something like this from me? You just cared about your legs rather than Guru's life! So, you came here just to see this anchor? I'm the two-legged human body you were going to sacrifice, right? Don’t be scared. It promised that it wouldn't hurt you. I can cure my legs only by sacrificing you, Shankar! Hey! Have you gone nuts? Hey! Did it really help you walk? Yes. If it can help you walk again, it definitely can give me one million ringgit, right? What? It just wants a two-legged animal, right? Why should I be the one for it? We can offer him up. What do you mean? Yes. It will not harm him, right? No, It won't. Sir, don't be scared. It will not do anything to you. Hey, tell me what to do next. Untie the bond and set it free. Untie him. Shankar, help me. Come on. Come on. Praise the almighty! Where is the body I asked for? One man's trash… another man's treasure. Who are you? With the ashes of the grave, smeared all over his body. He who walks the earth in a nomad's form. To you, I am known as Poosaandi! With every answer you receive, a new question arises! To those of you who mock the Almighty… we will teach you a great lesson! Even if you throw me to the sea with a stone tied to my body, the Almighty will ensure my deliverance! I waited for this opportunity for thousands of years! Betrayers! The time for my revenge has arrived. Here is my treasure! Praises to The Almighty! The Son of Madurai! Let's go back to the kingdom of Pandian! Your body will be mine. Check on him. The Almighty! Time will come! Sir, what about our wishes? I'm rich. I got the money! I can enjoy my life after this! I am going to party soon! I am a millionaire now! We've got the money! I got the money! I am rich! I got the money! "Poochandi will come for you!" The term "Poochandi" has been commonly used to scare people. We always thought that "Poochandi" was either a demon or a ghost. But the real meaning of Poochandi is the relationship between history and religion. There was a dark era in the history of the Tamilians. They called it the era of the Kalapir Atchi. They introduced a new rule as soon as they came to power. "Nobody must worship Lord Shiva. Worshiping Him in the temples has been forbidden. Stop wearing Thiruneer." After they introduced these rules, if anyone happened to use it, they'd be punished. If you saw someone using it, you'd be punished as well! The devotees of Shiva disobeyed this rule. They would rub Thiruneer on their bodies. They said they would wear Thiruneer despite the fact that it was forbidden. They disobeyed the law. They were called "Poochandi", the followers of Lord Shiva. They are called "aandi". They would rub Thiruneer on their bodies, and hence they were called "Poochandi".
