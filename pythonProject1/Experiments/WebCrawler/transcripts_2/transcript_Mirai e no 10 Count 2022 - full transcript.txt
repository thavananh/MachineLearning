foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- [Kyoumei Professional Boxing Club] [Practise Matches - Kyoumei High School] Well, then, let's begin! - Thank you for having us. - Let's have a good match! Hey, come back here. Aren't you gonna apologise for bumping into us? I'm sorry, man. What's with that attitude? Aren't you a first year at Matsu High? You think you can just disrespect your senpai, you brat? Let's not do this, okay? I ain't in the mood for this shit. What!? The fuck is wrong with you? First match, flyweight class. In the red corner, we have Junpei Ushiyama-kun from Kyoumei High School. And in the blue corner, we have Daichi Amatsu-kun from Matsubadai High School. - Amatsu. - Yes, sir? Don't be afraid to hit him. - As long as you do your best, it's okay to lose. - Yessir! Get back here, asshole! Punch him, Amatsu! Stop! Stop, stop! [Round 2 - Lightweight Class] Tatsuya Tamanoi (Matsubadai) VS Shouto Matsuo (Kyoumei) [Round 3 - Bantamweight Class] Riku Tomobe (Matsubadai) VS Souta Okubo (Kyoumei) Raise your guard! Your guard's down! Bring it back up! Stop, stop! What-- hey, hey! What's going on here!? Wh-What're you doing, young man!? Don't move! Stop right there! Fourth match. In the red corner, we have Saya Okumura-san from Kyoumei High School. And in the blue corner, we have Akari Mizuno-san from Matsubadai High School. Let's go, Mizuno! - Remember what happened last time, Mizuno? - She took me down with body blows. She's got a good eye-- if you drop your guard, she'll go for your face. - Be careful. - Yessir. Wait, what did you say? Kirisawa-san, it's about Saijou-kun. Saijou? I know what I saw. Saijou knocked Onoda-kun down with a punch. Then he went for Hiroyama-kun. Hey, hey! What's going on here!? - Hey, hold on, now-- - Don't interrupt, Saijou-kun. What happened? Onoda-kun. I ran into him on accident, and out of nowhere he started hitting me. That ain't right! Then he came for me next. Nah, man, ya hit me first! Hell, I'm still hurtin' from it! I heard there was another with you? Yeah, Sawa. A first year. And he's unharmed? - Yes, he ran for his life. - What, from me? It's fortunate you didn't injure Onoda-kun and Hiroyama-kun too seriously. But if you'd hit students from another school, we'd have quite the case on our hands. More than that, if you were caught by the police you'd be detained on the spot. All you boxing fools are the same... - Why're ya pinnin' it all on me!? - Excuse me? Saijou-kun, how did this happen!? - I can't believe one of ours actually hit someone! - Orihara-sensei. We're so sorry, Principal Ohba. You should be apologising to Onoda-kun and Hiroyama-kun. We're sorry, Onoda-kun. We're so, so sorry, Hiroyama-kun. How about you, Saijou? We haven't heard you apologise once! - Ain't no reason I gotta... - Did you really hit these two? - Of course he did! I saw it myself! - I'm asking Saijou, not you. Did you hit them? Then apologise. No matter what your reasons are, you owe them an apology. Saijou-kun! Fine, then! I made a mistake! But that's all your fault, Coach! His fault? The reason I was so pissed off is 'cause Coach didn't let me compete! The boxers who'll go up against Kyoumei are... ...Tomobe. Yer kiddin'! Excuse me, what? What on earth is he going on about, Kirisawa-sensei? Subs by Taabou@LJ/D-Addicts ; taaboufs@Twitter If you sell these subs, Shougo Kirisawa's gonna steal your girl. Mirai e no 10 Count: 10 Counts to the Future ~ Episode 07 ~ Mizuno's match was cancelled because of you! What if the whole club suffers because of what you did? I can't turn back time, man. What? Just leave me alone. Don't you dare leave. You wanna get hit too, Tamanoi-san? Momosuke! Momosuke Saijou will be suspended from school for three days to give him time to reflect on his actions. However, it seems the reason Saijou lashed out was because he couldn't compete in Kyoumei High School's practise matches. He felt the team had deliberately left him out. That isn't true... Saijou said so himself, didn't he? As Saijou's homeroom teacher, he's told me plenty of times that he's the most skilled player in the boxing club. Is that true, Kirisawa-sensei? In terms of boxing techniques, yeah. So why didn't you let Saijou-kun compete? The decision was based on my judgment. Just come at me with everything you got. That'll be enough to decide. Any club would follow their coach's decision, wouldn't they? We're just asking him why he decided to leave Saijou out! You promised Principal Ohba you'd defeat Kyoumei High School in next year's Inter-High. And these practise matches were specifically set up for that goal. And yet you refused to send your best player for reasons we, frankly, don't understand. Based on Coach Kirisawa's judgment, our second year boxer, Riku Tomobe, better represented the team than Saijou. And did Saijou-kun accept that? Well, that's... Everyone knew he was skilled. It's no surprise being left out of the practise matches affected him. And he's ill-tempered and fierce to begin with. - Is he? - That's not true! Hibino-sensei, if you saw him you'd understand. That boy pounced on them like a beast! - A beast!? - Kirisawa-sensei! Did you have a points system for choosing your players? No, not at all. What? - You didn't!? - What's that supposed to mean? If I had to explain it... Tomobe's hard work deserved to be recognised. But if we pit Saijou-kun and Tomobe-kun against each other, who would win the match? - That's not the point... - Saijou, naturally. - Kirisawa-sensei! - So why not let Saijou-kun play? He just said... Your vague method of judging based on "hard work" is exactly why Saijou's so frustrated! It's no surprise he hit someone. - He's a violent boy to begin with. - No, he isn't! The fact of the matter is the way you chose your players wasn't fair. And it's safe to say the cause for Saijou-kun's outburst is you, Kirisawa-sensei. Stop right there! That's a little too drastic, isn't it? - Yes, club activities are part of educating students... - That's why we, as their educators, are responsible. That's true, but...! Kirisawa-sensei. Is there anything you'd like to say? It's exactly as everyone says. The fault lies with me. - Kirisawa-sensei! - Is that so? In that case, all boxing club activities will be suspended. What!? I believe Saijou-kun isn't the only problem you have. Meeting adjourned. Hey! Our club's suspended? And we don't know how long it'll be. But why're they putting the blame on us, too? You gotta be kidding me, Momosuke... Transferring out of nowhere, acting like an asshole-- he already pissed me the hell off! - Why're we being punished for what he did? - Please let us train, Coach! We can't just give up! Neither of us want to accept this, either. But one of our members hit someone outside the sport. And that's more terrible than I can say. Momosuke... None of you are allowed in here until our suspension is lifted. Akari... Iba-kun, you should leave, too. You don't have to worry about us. Right. Thank you. I can understand why they're all so angry. To be honest, I feel the same way, too. How can you stay so calm, Kirisawa-san? Everyone else is in shock, and yet... We don't know what actually happened, right? What do you mean? What else is there to know? The fact is someone got hurt. I know that. I don't think there's any way to justify Saijou-kun's... I watched your sparring the other day. And I saw how you chose Tomobe-kun over Saijou-kun. What? You really put your heart into it, didn't you? It reminded me of who you used to be in high school. But I'm the principal of this school now, even if I might've been your manager then. And no matter how much I might miss the old days, I can't take your side. Picking someone because "they worked hard" doesn't work with kids these days. Going with your gut is... no, how do I put it... These days you need a proper explanation for them to understand your decisions. Isn't that right, Orihara-sensei? Yes, ma'am. It won't be easy to get your club back up and running. Can you really train a Kyoumei-winning boxer in a year? Yeah, I can. Excuse us, ma'am. Why would you say that? How're you so confident we can win? I don't get him! I really don't! Here we go again... Any other coach would get sooooo pissed! But he didn't tell Saijou-kun jack! Then when the rest of the teachers blamed him he was like, "Yeah, it's my fault." And then he told Principal Ohba, "Yeah, I'll train a winner." And when I asked him why he was being like that, he didn't say anything! Sounds like your coach-to-adviser communication's not doing so well. Kirisawa-san's a freakin' weirdo! I don't know what the heck he's thinking! - I thought you liked guys like that? - What? I remember you saying you hated men who blab on and on. When did I say that? When, when, when, when? - In your sleep, I think... - Stop teasing me like that! Okay, sis, you're way too drunk for me to listen to you! - Come back, Kaede! - Stop, I might fall! Drink some water! - Keita, it's bathtime. - I don't wanna! Gimme that! It's time for your bath! Bathe! And you get off of me, Aoi! Size 28!? Your feet're huge! - What's your size? - 27.5. Dude, we're basically the same! How about you, Sawa? I'm size 26. 26!? No-one's that small! What are you, a middle schooler!? A damn elementary kid, that's what you are! Hurry up and walk! I'm sorry. I'm Saijou's coach. It's my fault that he hurt you like that. I'm really sorry for what happened. - Nah, sensei, no matter how sorry you are... - That guy's seriously bad news. - You oughta kick him outta the club. - Seriously! The thing is, though... I don't know if a serious boxer'd hit someone just because they bumped into them. He totally hit us, though, man! Yeah, but there's gotta be another reason he did it. What's that supposed to mean? We're telling you the truth. Let's go, Sawa. The hell's he covering Saijou's ass for? If he didn't wanna apologise, he can fuck off. - Sawa! - Yes? Carry this! Nice one, man. Take mine too! Ohno-sensei. What's wrong? Well, I'm not allowed in there, so... - What is it? - Um... There was this boy, Sawa-kun, who was with the kids Saijou hit. He's in your class, right? Yes, that's right. I've been wondering why he was the only one who didn't get hit. Has he said anything to you? He ran away, didn't he? Why don't you ask Saijou-kun to clear it up? In that case... Maybe you could tell me where it is that Saijou lives. Absolutely not. You're only a part-time teacher, Kirisawa-sensei. Yeah, but... He's one of my boxers, too... Yeah, that's true... I'm teaching him, too. I know. It's hard not to care about a troublemaker like him. Yes, but... And didn't you say club activities are part of their education? Don't tell anybody I gave you this information. Thank you, ma'am. What? What kinda home is this? Holy crap... Please have a seat. - Thank you, ma'am. - Of course. You can sit here. I'm truly sorry for my son's recklessness. I'm sure I have to apologise to those poor kids' parents, too. Well, we're lucky the kids he hit are from Matsubadai High School, too. It doesn't seem to be that big a case so far. How's Momosuke-kun doing? Oh, he's locked himself up in his room. Um... That boy's been getting into fights with his friends ever since he was little. That's why his father suggested he take up boxing. I didn't want him to do such a violent sport, but... Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to call it "violent". It's fine. When he started boxing, he seemed to calm down a lot. But to tell you the truth, I don't know what goes on in Momosuke's head at all. - We don't really talk at home... - You don't? That boy's father owns a number of French and Italian restaurants back in Osaka. And he cheated on me for years. When I finally divorced him, my son and I moved here to Yokohama. I was born and raised here, you see, and I never did fit in in Osaka. We bought this condo with the alimony, and since he sends us money for living expenses, we've never been happier. Oh... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to talk your ear off. Let me call Momosuke, yes? Momosuke, Kirisawa-sensei's here to see you! It's Kirisawa-sensei from the boxing club! I'm sorry. I promised a friend I'd meet up with them, so I have to go. If he doesn't come out, feel free to enter his room. It's the first room down the hall. Make sure you give him a stern talking to! Uh... And make sure to drink the tea before it gets cold! She's a terrible mother, isn't she? I mean, look at the kid she raised. Whaddya want, huh? I got enough of a scolding from the school already. I wanted to know why you didn't hit Sawa. - Sawa? - He was with the other two. Oh. You mean the shrimp? He ran away, didn't he? I didn't care enough to run after him and hit him. What now? What happened? What? Tell me the truth. Man, screw you. Stop looking at me like you think you know me. I can't stand adults like you. You know how my Ma said she was goin' out to see a friend? Wanna know the truth? She got herself a new boyfriend. It's like everywhere I look I'm surrounded by crappy adults. You gonna quit boxing, then? If you keep this up, nobody in the club'll want you to come back. Was that a threat, Coach? Saijou. It pissed me off that you left me out! So when those guys bumped into me, I hit them! That's all it is, man. Stop looking at me like you think you know me. I can't stand adults like you. It's Imura. It was nice to see you again after all this time. Do you think we could meet up? I'd like to talk to you about something. How's coaching the boxing club working out? - Huh? - Well... You mentioned the other day that coaching changed you, didn't you? Oh... I mean, I wouldn't say it's enough to make me forget about Shiori, but... How do I put it... Does your heart feel lighter? Yeah. But, y'know... There're some bad things, too. Especially when the kids get into trouble. I see. Shougo-kun, there's a reason I texted you. Go on. I have a client at work who lives close to the train station. They're a landowner, as it so happens. And I heard from them that they loved eating at General Yakitori. When we spoke the other day, I told them about you. And they mentioned that if you wanted to re-open the store, they'd be happy to offer a lot at a low price. What? Granted, we'd been drinking when the topic came up, so I'm not entirely sure they meant what they said, but... If you did want to start the restaurant back up, Shougo-kun, I'd like you to meet them. I'm sorry if I overstepped. No, you're fine. What do you think, Shougo-kun? I'll need some time to think about it. Of course. Once you've made your decision, you can call me any time. Right. Thank you so much. Jab! Straight! Nice... One, two! Yeah, that's what I'm talking about! Give me a one-two-double uppercut! One more! Yeah! Nice punch, kid! Hello. Saijou-kun! What're you doing here!? Orihara-sensei? - Kai-san, why're you helping Saijou-kun train? - What? It was killin' me bein' trapped at home! Don't give me that! Go home! What? What? What? Aw, and I was finally gettin' some good training in... Drop the attitude already! What the hell's with her? It's not like I'm the only bad guy here... So, what you're telling me is Saijou's been suspended for hitting an upperclassman. Correct. And the reason he was so excited to train with me was because I had no idea about it. That's right. So you didn't know Saijou'd be here when you came? Yes. And seeing him when you came in was a surprise. - I did come here for a reason, though. - You did? It's about Kirisawa-san. Of course it is. Has Kirisawa-san always been so indifferent about things? Indifferent? One of our kids hit someone outside the ring. That sounds pretty bad. But he's acting like nothing happened! He's got to feel some way about it, right? What do you think? I mean, after everything that's happened to him, it's become harder for him to connect with people. But sometimes he isn't like that. Sometimes he just tugs at your heart... Your heart? And then he's back to normal. Oh, don't get me wrong-- I didn't mean anything weird by that! - Uh, look, why don't we change the subject? - I'm serious! I didn't mean anything! - I don't know what goes on in Kirisawa's head. - But you two're close, aren't you? Let's get outta here. This place reeks. Kai-san! Oh, no. Oh, sorry, I just... As the club adviser, I wanted to know-- You should ask Kirisawa yourself. - Please stop bothering me about this. - Kai-san! Oh, I'm sorry! Sawa-kun. See ya later. No, hey... I should've told you sooner, but... I wanna make it clear you aren't in any trouble, okay? I just want to know the truth. Is it about Saijou? It looks like you're always hanging out with Hiroyama and Onoda. You guys close? Are you? - We are, sir. - Sure didn't look that way to me. They're bullying you, aren't they? No, they aren't. Don't lie to me. See, I just don't think Saijou's dumb enough to do something like that. Everyone in the boxing club knows the consequences of hitting someone outside the sport. So I'm pretty sure he must've had a good reason to do what he did. There's no way he'd hit someone because they ran into him. Sawa-kun. Tell us the truth. I'm sure Saijou didn't hit you because you didn't do anything wrong. So... Knowing that... At least, the way I see it... You owe it to him to tell us the truth. Please, Sawa-kun. You're right. They made me their slave. I'm being bullied. And that day... Let's not do this, okay? I ain't in the mood for this shit. What!? The fuck is wrong with you? I'm sorry for bumping into you. It was my fault. It's good you know your place. You should've just said so earlier. Let's go, Sawa! - Ow, that hurts! - Stop being such a pussy! Hold up, you assholes! Y'all bullyin' this kid? Quit doin' stuff like that! Excuse me? It's assholes like you that piss me off most. I thought you knew your place, brat. That doesn't mean I'll let you bully him! That hurt...! You wanna go, first year? Screw you! You asshole! Aren't you sick of doing shit for assholes like them? Aren't you? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry! Thank you for telling me. Come in. You called, Principal Ohba? I'd like you to bring Onoda-kun, Hiroyama-kun, and their homeroom teacher here. Of course, ma'am. Saijou-kun still made a mistake hitting those boys. But... Considering his reasons for doing so, he isn't completely at fault. Your suspension is lifted! The boxing club is free to continue their training. And Saijou-kun can return to school tomorrow. Thank you, ma'am! I guess I made a mistake. I blamed Saijou-kun so easily without hearing his side of the story. I can't say I blame you. Excuse me. How do I apologise to him? I know how I can get. I get all caught up in my emotions, and I can't help but say what's on my mind. I don't know how you stay so level-headed, Kirisawa-san. Kaede always tells me I should stop being like this. And Keita had put up with a lot, too. Keita? Oh, well, I... My ex-husband and I would fight all the time because of this. And that's why we split up. I wish I'd married someone like you, Kirisawa-san. Oh, I'm sorry! I don't want to marry you or anything! No, I just... It's just, you know... I'm glad that you're here to coach these kids, Kirisawa-san. That's all I wanted to say. Oh, God... If I had to deal with Saijou-kun's incident by myself... Chances are I would've never figured out the truth. The same goes for what happened with Mizuno-san and Edogawa-kun. You've saved me so many times, Kirisawa-san. Come on, don't say that. Thank you. I just wanted to thank you properly, Kirisawa-san. Nah, you don't have to thank me for anything. I thought you'd say that. But I wanted to. I owe you a lot, Kirisawa-san. Moving on, though, I'm glad Saijou-kun can come back to school. Among all our boxers, he's our best bet at beating Kyoumei, isn't he? You could say that, but... - What? - I don't know. The way I see it, I don't think we have any say in it. Whatever happens to Saijou, I mean. It won't be easy to get your club back up and running. Can you really train a Kyoumei-winning boxer in a year? If you keep this up, nobody in the club'll want you to come back. Attention, members of the boxing club, please proceed to your training room. Once again: members of the boxing club, please proceed to your training room. So Saijou-kun did all that to save Sawa-kun? Yes. He didn't start a fight with them because they ran into him. And did he tell you himself that he tried to save Sawa? Well... He might've just punched them 'cause he felt like it. No matter his reasons, he still hit someone. But if what you're saying is true, sensei, then... If that's what happened, Saijou'll come back. - You think he went home? - Maybe he feels guilty or something. - Don't say that... - Sawa was telling the truth. Is that not enough to forgive Saijou for what he did? No, it isn't. Tamanoi-kun... I don't want Momosuke to come back at all. I feel the same way. I don't want to train with him. Mizuno...! But I think it'd be better if he came back. How about you, first years? Well, I don't really... I don't wanna train with him. And I...! I don't know. Guys, please reconsider this. Saijou-kun's been boxing for a long time! - Without him, we... - Can't he train at Kai-san's gym? Exactly. But that's... We can only have boxers from our club represent Matsu High at official competitions. Will you still let Saijou be part of the club if he trains at Kai's gym? Of course not. So you're telling me that you want Saijou out of this club... And rob him of his chance to ever compete in official competitions. He's right. He can just go pro, then. - Pro? - Yeah, then he can compete! You guys being serious right now? Hey. We should get going, Orihara-sensei. What? I think it'd be better if we left. I want you all to discuss this thoroughly before making a decision. But... From what you've told me so far, all of you are about to make a horrible decision. Remember that. Let's go. What if they don't let Saijou-kun come back? What do we do if that happens? Saijou-kun. I talked to Sawa about why you hit those two. He told me the truth. Saijou-kun, I'm so sorry for not listening to you. We told the rest of the club what Sawa-kun told us. And they're talking about you right now. If you got something on your mind... You better tell 'em now. Saijou-kun. Let's go. So you'll forgive him, Tomobe? We had to cancel our practise matches with Kyoumei because of him. And even before that, he was always an asshole. He's been selfish from the beginning. I don't care how good he is. I don't wanna train with anyone who ruins our teamwork. I never liked Momosuke to begin with. You're gonna judge him based on that? But ever since Momosuke came, being here just... It wasn't as fun any more. Yeah... Sorry, all they had was milk. That's okay. Thank you. Do you think Saijou-kun'll talk to them? But Momosuke... Momosuke fought them because they were bullies. If I was in his shoes, I would've looked the other way. Without a doubt. We're not talking about whether he did the right thing or not. He hit someone. Members of the boxing club shouldn't hit anybody, and he couldn't even follow that one simple rule! I just know he'll keep causing problems like this. And then we'll get in trouble for it. - But what if Momosuke apologised? - Like hell he would. What if he apologised? What do you think, first years? You still wouldn't forgive him? If he apologised... It might be okay. Oh, how's Keita doing? What? Has he been practising his boxing? Oh... Yeah, but he doesn't like training with Kaede. I think he wants to train with you again, Kirisawa-san. Well then, tell him I'll meet him at the park. I will. What were you like in high school, Kirisawa-san? Huh? I was just wondering. All I did then was box. But, you know, Matsu High wasn't exactly a prep school back then. And after club activities ended, I'd spend all my time hanging out with Kai and the rest of our friends. What did you guys do? Stupid stuff. Stuff that made us laugh. I can't imagine you like that at all. Nah, I was pretty normal. Do you still have things that make you laugh now? Of course I do. Like what? Uh, you know... - When I watch comedies... - You watch that stuff? Of course I do. Keita wants you to come over again. You know, to have dinner with us. Oh. Kaede looked like she had a lot of fun last time. And I... I was happy, too. Well... I guess I'll, uh, come visit you again sometime. Really? Sure. Do you think Saijou-kun talked to them? Oh, please let everyone accept Saijou-kun in the club...! I don't think there's anyone on Earth who's never been in trouble. Momosuke isn't a special case. So all this talk about forgiving him, or making him quit... It sounds like bullying to me. What do you mean "bullying"? You're taking away Saijou-kun's chances to box. And that makes you guys no better than the bullies Saijou-kun hit! Don't you see that, Akari? It's true he made a mistake when he chose to hit them. But when I think about what Momosuke did... To be honest, he inspires me. I think he's amazing. So... I think we should forgive Momosuke. We aren't bullying him... - Momosuke! - Saijou-kun! What, we ain't doin' any trainin' today? We can't beat Kyoumei if we don't train, y'all. Stop that. Don't you have something to tell us? He's right. You owe us an apology. Momosuke. Yeah, my bad. What the hell was that? Apologise properly! I did! - We were suspended because of you! - And that's not all! Have you even thought about your attitude? My what? - You're ruining our club! - Can't you see that!? Calm down, everyone. There's no point in starting a fight. And Saijou-kun, stop messing around and apologise properly. What the hell's wrong with y'all? Goin' on and on about sayin' sorry... - What, is everything my fault? - That's not it. You sayin' I gotta shut up and be a good boy to join your little club, then? - Yeah, exactly. - That's not it! Yes, it is! We just want you to stop arguing with Coach and being mean to everyone! No way in hell. Excuse me? I ain't doin' it. You can't box if you bottle shit up. Do you not want to be in the boxing club, Momosuke? Didn't I say not to call me Momosuke? - You disrespectful-- this is why we don't want you! - Screw you! Who the fuck would join you!? By all means, guys, enjoy your friendly little boxing club. Be seein' ya. - Momosuke! - Saijou-kun! Momosuke! God damn it! Saijou-kun? - It's hopeless. - What? I know I wasn't with you long, but thanks for everything. Saijou-kun! Are you really okay with this? - Can you really just leave? - Man, leave me alone! Ain't nothin' I can do now. Saijou-kun! Coach. Looks like things didn't go well. He wasn't able to apologise properly. All right. We wouldn't be like this if he'd just said sorry. Don't worry. Nobody's in trouble. If you've decided you won't box with Saijou, then that's that. What'll happen to Momosuke? That's up to him. It has nothing to do with any of you. There're all kinds of people in the world, aren't there? Some people don't know how to live their lives. And some people don't know how to express themselves nicely. Anybody'd have a hard time dealing with people like that. It's hard to accept people that don't fit in. That's just the way we are. And you know what? That's true for adults as much as it is for high schoolers. Hell, you could call me the Saijou of the faculty room. What? All right, let's start training. Get changed, everyone. Hold on, now. We can't just... Are you really okay with this, guys? Saijou-kun won't ever be able to compete. - He might even quit boxing. - Sensei. Stop treating them like little kids. In any case, I respect everyone's decision. It's time for training. Get changed. What's wrong? Nishiyama-san! Mizuno! What the hell is wrong with me? Damn it! Saijou-kun!? Momosuke! What happened, Saijou-kun!? Are you okay? Saijou-kun! - Coach! - Orihara-sensei! Coach! - Hurry, Coach! - Coach! Sensei! Your headache was caused by traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhaging, likely caused by a blow to the head. But if no major problems arise while you stay the night here, you'll be fine. The real issue is that you have some swelling in this area. Swelling? You have a 3 millimetre aneurysm. An aneurysm? This can be fixed, right, Doctor? Unfortunately, something like this won't heal on its own. It won't...? And I'm afraid there's a chance it could rupture and cause cerebral haemorrhaging. While there's only a 1% chance it'll happen, we should still continue to monitor your condition within the near future. What if it ruptures? In the event of a rupture, it's likely you'll become seriously disabled or even die. Wait, hold on now. It'll be fine as long as it doesn't rupture, right? - That's correct. - What about boxing? Boxing? I mean... Will I still be able to box, Doctor? I'm sorry. It's just not possible. Not possible?
