foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Subtitle Edit By Garlic Surin When we woke up in the morning, sunflowers were in bloom, so we all went to the amusement park. It was really hot, so we had some ice cream. It was really good. Day 1 "Izumi" Nobody's home. Let's ask at the agricultural co-op. "Resume" "Izumi Farm" "Farm Stall" "Black Figs" Dad, lunchtime! OK! Let's eat. Thanks. Erina, thank you too. Come here. Up we go! I'm starving! You take some, too. Thanks. OK then, let's eat... - I already did. Bad manners. Tastes great. Which ones did you make? Erina made that one. - Did you really? It tastes great! You made a lot for Dad, didn't you? What did you make? The fried chicken. - Tastes great. Really? Good. This is awesome, Erina. "This is Shishikari Town Hall" What an idyllic island, huh? This is a great environment. Hey, don't look so glum. Things will be fine, be sincere and they'll hire you. You start over again... Hey, what the... Mutsuo! Hurry, let's go! Thanks, man. We're suddenly so busy. Don't worry about it. Hunting season is still a while off so it's all right. Can you do it? Can you do it? Here. - Yeah, thanks. Ready? Jun, why not quit hunting and work for us? Yeah, then you can eat my handmade lunch every day. I'd like that. And I could see Erina every day. But I don't want to call your dad "Boss". Boss! Boss! - Stop that. These figs will be the island's specialty. I have to expand the farm. Help us out for the island's future. For the island, huh? hi Hi, there. - Are you a tourist? Did you pay for that? They're not free to take. Did you pay for that? Hey. You there. Hey! - Stop it, don't mind him. Let's not mess with him. What's with that guy? What a waste. Which way did he go? It could have been about 50 or 60 kph. He said he needed to pee. Lots of meat on this one. Looks tasty. I'm really sorry, I was in a hurry. Will I be ticketed for this? Don't be ridiculous, the boar suddenly appeared. Well, yes. Animals over humans, huh? - It's an animal, but still. I'm sorry. Yoko, are you all right? - Shoichi. You drive them home, OK? Thank you. Her license would have been suspended. Sorry. You're leaving today, right? Shin was about to take me to the port. Oh, and don't bother informing town hall about this boar. I'll ask Jun to do away with it. - Thank you. Yoko takes care of my father, you see. Thank you so much. Glad to be of help before I go. Shouldn't we report this? What do you think would happen if a family who cares for an old person loses its car on this island? You were born and raised here, so you get it, don't you? I do, but... A cop's job isn't only about brandishing the law and arresting criminals. I don't mean turn a blind eye to crimes, but it's necessary to flexibly gauge what's best for the island's residents. Uh... What do you mean? "A fine policeman" "should by all means become a scab for society." A scab? If blood is flowing somewhere, do your best and focus on stopping the flow. Yes, sir. We're right on time. Thanks, you were a big help. No problem. Starting today, you'll be the one protecting this island. Yes, sir. Good. "Shishikari Town Hall" Hello. Hi, there. "Black Figs" Wow. These are really fine figs. We just started shipping, so couldn't bring a lot. Don't worry about it. The scarcer the better, since it'll add to their value. Izumi Farm exists to benefit the residents. Your black figs will save this island. Keita, be here tomorrow by 10 a.m., don't be late. We're counting on you. - I'll be here. See you. Hey, it's hot today, isn't it? Are you thirsty today? Here you go. Have some. It's good. Want some ice cream? I do. What flavor? Lemon. - OK. In a cone or a cup? A cup. OK. Here you go. It's good. What next? Chocolate. OK. It's nice out today so let's go on a picnic. Sounds good. Then I'll go buy veggies for our boxed lunch. I bought some. Hi, I'm back. - Hi, dear. Shin's arrival celebration is from 6 p.m. at the hall. And we're watching that interview together. Who would have thought he'd become the island's police officer? Where's Erina? - Wasn't she in the yard? Erina, I'm home. Strange, she was here. Maybe she went to the orchard to get you? I didn't pass her. Erina. Why is this... I'll go look for her. Erina! You go that way. Whoa, it's huge. How... Hang on a sec. Hold its legs. Ready, go. This is fine. Some weird guy is roaming around. A weird guy? We're getting more tourists, so you should patrol more often. Since Officer Okazaki is gone now. - Got it. Yeah, what's up? Jun, we can't find Erina. I found that weirdo's bottle in our yard. Shin and I were discussing him just now. Help us, will you? Erina! Hey, whoa, a rifle? - Don't worry. It's not loaded. Just for protection. I'll go that way. Erina! Jun, come to the greenhouse. What are you doing? Where's Erina? Who are you? - Her father. And this is my greenhouse. Oh... So her name is Erina. She's cute. Where is she? I don't know. Smells so nice! You... Don't move! Is this loaded? Is this thing loaded? Let go! You... Shin, cuff him, quick! Ow! Ow! Hey! Hey, come back! Hey, come back! Come back! Hey! He attacked first, didn't he? Keita? I found Erina. Erina! She was playing at Shokichi's place. - I'm sorry. - I see, glad you're OK. I'm hungry. Right. We should head to the hall. Yeah, go on ahead. I'll go after I clean up inside. You sure? Then we'll go ahead. See you later. See you. Get in. OK? Good, then we're off! How about... we say it was self-defense? Then what do you suggest? We have to do something! There's no point. It's over for me. Come on, man... You're reviving this island with these figs, right? People depend on you. I killed someone under these figs. It doesn't matter if it was self-defense or not. Everything is over. The island's future, my future... It's all over. All over? What about Kana and Erina? At a time like this... Why? For this asshole! A scab... Let's... pretend this never happened. Come on, that's not... What are you doing? It's a boar, a boar. What, again? So many lately. Shokichi, you'll get germs. Share some later. There's a gathering today, right? We can't eat it today. But we'll go to the gathering later. See you there. Shin. Hold this. You think Shokichi noticed? - Don't worry, he's senile. But do you think anyone will come looking for this guy? He didn't carry any ID. His smartphone wasn't locked and had no texts, so it should be OK. I see. Um, is it all right to store the body here? For the time being, right? Nobody will come here for him. Let's bury him tomorrow morning. Let's go to the hall now. Hello, I'm Suzuki. Thank you, this way. Come in. Excuse me. Did your father mention anything like going far away? He said he'd be back by evening. But I can't get a hold of him and he's not home yet, so something feels off. Excuse me. - Oh, go ahead. Did he ever mention Komisaka? No. I always opposed him working as a rehabilitator for offenders. I told him, "What if something bad happens"? Providing such a nice apartment for an asshole like him. Your father's a fine man. You know him? "Reviving his hometown with black figs: Izumi Farm" "Young workers and new residents wanted" Shishikari Island, a tranquil, peaceful island located in Ise Bay, is currently attracting national spotlight. The reason? These pitch-black figs. And here's the man who started it all: Mr. Keita Izumi of Izumi Farm. Hello. - Hello. "Congregation Hall" "Welcome home, Shin!" "Welcome home, Shin!" Our black figs are loaded with sweetness, and have much higher sugar content than other kinds. And they have a rich, thick texture. Why did you decide to start producing these black figs? This island has long faced an ageing, shrinking population. In my search to find a new specialty for the island, I came across these in France. May I try one? - Please do. Thank you. It looks a bit grotesque at first glance, but here goes. So sweet! Figs are in season. Please try our island's black figs! "Mayor Shoji" Please tell us about your Island. There is absolutely no crime here. Everyone helps and supports each other to live peaceful lives. That's what our island is like. What does living a good life really mean? She took the mic! - The answer is here on this island. A living environment surrounded by nature. Our island seeks young people to come work here! Everyone please come visit Shishikari Island! Ready, now! We're waiting for you! Why not come try some black figs and experience good living here on Shishikari Island? I don't want outsiders coming here! It won't lead to anything good. The mayor is always looking towards the future. I have good news. The black fig production plan has been recognized, and we're eligible to receive the Regional Revitalization Promotion Grant. 500 million yen! The government will give us 500 million yen! Does that mean we'll be able to build a good hospital here? Of course! And renovate town hall and the elementary school. Yay Mayor Shoji! Yay figs! Hooray! Keita! Keita! If this island regains vitality, that's enough to make me happy. I'll do my best growing figs. Shin! Shin! We're counting on you from now on, too! Yes. Say it louder. Shin, welcome home. Yeah, welcome home! Look out for us from tomorrow! Keita, you're awesome. You were so cool, Keita. I was so proud of you. Erina was happy, too. Everyone on this island depends on you. I'm honestly glad. I can finally repay their kindness. It's no use, we can't set sail! But our parents are out there! You have to let go. It's too late. Why? Help us set sail! I'll go! You can't! You'll all die! Please. Let us go out there! Jun, you ask them too! Keita, it's no use. It's no use. Keita! - Out of my way! Get a hold of yourself! We can't lose you all as well! Don't worry, all the islanders consider you as their own kids! That's right! Kana! Kana! I'll protect you! Erina, are you up? Are you awake? - Hey there. Let's all be happy together. Yeah! Let's run! - Shall we, then? Ready, go! Erina! Erina! - Call Jun! Jun! Here he comes, Erina! So fast! Wait, Erina! - You're so fast! - Take that! Go, go! Day 2 Under the air-raid shelter? Shouldn't we just bury him in the mountains? No, boars might dig him up. True. Yes, Moriya here. Prefectural police? Hello. I'm Moriya, the resident officer. I'm Aoki, prefectural police. This way. Hello, I'm Moriya. Excuse me. Are you Keita Izumi? - Yes, I am. Do you work here? No, I live nearby so I help out. Um, what brings the police to this island? Do you recognize these men? No. Me neither. Never seen them. - Why did you come here? We found this in Mr. Suzuki's apartment. We confirmed they came to the island by ferry yesterday. They were probably heading here. Who are they? Mr. Suzuki works to rehabilitate offenders. And what did the other guy do? You don't want to know. Raped and killed a girl. That's awful. Good thing I didn't hire such a guy, then. Why the bandage? Got bit by a boar. It was trapped and thrashed around. Where's that boar now? In his warehouse. He's a hunter. Lucky for me it wasn't serious. These are young figs before they're planted outdoors. The roots and stems easily rot from pests, so we grow them here for a while. It's warm in here, so microbes and things promptly return to the soil. The soil is really important. You have a kid? Yes. Um... Isn't the Chief of Regional Revitalization coming today? Oh man, no way, he's a very busy man. I'm here to take a quick look around in his stead today. Does that mean the Regional Revitalization Promotion Grant... 500 million yen, huh? Well... it's pretty much guaranteed, I think. Thank you! So where's the owner of Izumi Farm? Sorry, we told him to be here by 10 a.m. Sorry. - He's not answering his phone. Excuse me. Hello? Yes, Moriya here. A body? Understood. Excuse me. We'll handle it. Please move back to the road, OK? Move back, OK? Please move back. Move back! Move back to the road! Thank you. - Move back! Thought it was our dead guy. Good, for now. Not good at all! A goddamn convicted murderer! He probably did that, too. We have to dispose of the body. What do we do? So it appears you've got a problem on your hands. Of course not. It has nothing to do with our town. This is a peaceful island. Well... the grant still hasn't been formally decided. I wasn't able to speak with Mr. Keita Izumi, either. Yes, well... We do understand that's necessary... He should be here any minute now. Any minute now... Too late. He already left. Where's Keita? Sorry, I still can't get a hold of him. Noge. You're so useless. Use your brain. Are you brain-dead? 500 million yen. The future of this island depends on those figs! Your job was to bring Keita on a leash if necessary! I'm sorry. If we don't get that 500 million, you take responsibility. Take out insurance on yourself and die! I'm sorry. Hello, Shoji speaking. Pay attention to the mountains too, not just the coastline. The residential areas have many vacant houses so it'll be a pain. Keep the residents from objecting and check each one. Mutsuo Komisaka is still here on this island. Find him. Understood? That's all. Attention. Salute. Dismissed. At a storage site in the mountains of Ikoma, Nara, a large pile of rubble collapsed over 4 construction workers severely injuring one of them. Police are investigating the cause. A body of a man was found on Shishikari Island. The man was identified as 70-year-old Kenji Suzuki of Nagoya, and his body was found in a car that had crashed into a field. The police... What is it? A mass e-mail from the mayor. It's about the body. An incident has occurred. The perpetrator could still be hiding. Please avoid unnecessary outings. If you see any suspicious persons, inform the police or... Suspicious persons, huh? We repeat... OK. Today is your favorite, hamburger steak. And with Dad! Yay! Put that away. Let's eat. Erina, we can draw together after we finish eating. That's nice. - Happy? We have to be careful outside. - Yeah, it's not safe. You watch out, too. And lock the doors. OK, then. Let's eat. It's been a while since we had this steak. Hope it's good. - It looks good. What's their plan? They're searching vacant houses first. Now is our only chance. Let's hurry and get rid of this. What? Maybe during the night is better. That's more suspicious. Shin. I'm terrified. I hope you don't mean... you're dropping out. No, it's not that! But I'm not sure I can keep on lying like this. He was a murderer who didn't deserve to live. We're fighting for this island. That's no lie, is it? Well, well... So you're all here. Shokichi informed me that you were handling a corpse. That old geezer can be useful at times. Hey, no violence, OK? Guess what? I can't sleep without this by my bedside. Who did it? Me. No, it was an accident! Erina was in danger! Is that so? Then you should have reported it when it happened. I... I suggested we hide it. I'm only kidding. Listen, I'm actually grateful for this. That you protected the fig farm. Now... let's eliminate the noise that disturbs the island. What's your plan? They won't find him under the shelter floor. Come on. The police and media believe this guy's still on this island. Who would want to visit an island with a murderer hiding there? In order to recover the island's good image, the only way is for the body to be found. Then they'll know it was foul play. We can't do that. Of course we can. Shin, you take the blame. You questioned him as a cop. He attacked you and you killed him. You got scared and buried the body. Sounds plausible, doesn't it? What the hell? That's bullshit. I'm quite serious. You suggested to cover up the murder, right? Then take responsibility. I'm sure people will understand. You tried to protect the island. I won't let him do that. I'll turn myself in. You can't. We need your figs to receive the government grant. That's why you tried to hide this, right? I feel the same way. We've experienced so much misery over the years. Young people left and the government ditched us. But our difficult period is behind us now. A new era has begun. Don't worry, Shin. I won't let her do that. Well then, Jun. Why don't you take all the blame instead? Yes, what a great idea! Then we won't have to move the body. Keita has always been smart and admirable, and now he's the savior of this island. Jun, doesn't that make you feel inferior? Instead of just hunting vermin, why don't you do something good for the island for once in your life? Everything's settled, then. Jun, hurry up and turn yourself in. Oh, forgot to say. Keita, after Jun is arrested, leave the island, OK? The truth could come to light anytime. I'll take over the farm. Once we get the grant, it won't matter who runs it. Sorry, I thought she'd help you... Jun! Day 3 Have you seen anyone come and go, or anyone suspicious recently? Well, this is such a rural area. That way! Mr. Kato! Nobody's up here. No traces, either! OK, keep looking! - Yes, sir. Your father passed away yesterday? Yes. Could you tell us how? Under what circumstances? Why? A quick rundown is fine... Leave us alone. It was just a heart attack. He died peacefully. Did you examine the body? What? Hey, are you disparaging me? No, that's not my intention, but... Whoa, you just laughed, didn't you? Get out of here. I don't have time to put up with you. Next! Hurry up and find the murderer. How annoying. Shishikari Island HQ, over. What's the situation? Struck on the back of her head with a shovel. Anything else? A shoulder wound from a machete. According to a town official, the victim left town hall by car late afternoon yesterday. She appears to have been killed by another passenger. The boat was found near the coast 10 km west of the port. "Shin" We've confirmed that it belongs to the town. She suffered head injuries and probably bled to death. Komisaka's prints were found on the machete and shovel nearby. She had no possessions. So Komisaka killed Shoji, took the boat and tried to escape, but got stranded. It's a cover-up. Chief. Komisaka didn't kill Shoji. What's your reasoning? Using both a shovel and machete to kill? He wouldn't bother doing such a thing. Someone is trying to fake it... I want evidence, not conjecture. Until then, this is our line of investigation. Did anyone hold any grudges against her? She was committed to developing this island, so I can't think of anybody who'd resent her. Nobody? Not one? That's correct. What are you doing? Mr. Tanabe, could we see the boar? Outsiders aren't allowed in to prevent disease. Was your husband home with you last night? No, he was drinking at a friend's house. At a time like this, leaving you and your daughter alone? Well, yes, but it's really close. I'm back. - Hi. Keita. Oh, hi there. - Sorry to bother you. So how's your wound? I'm doing better, thanks. It's reassuring having you around. Can't believe what's happened. Here, have one of these. I'll be here if you need anything. See you. They don't strike me as being suspicious. You think so? They're too normal. They don't seem to be afraid. From the beginning. Ew, what the hell? You think both are involved? There are people in this world who can lie without qualms. But anybody could become that person. "Resume" You're getting better at this, Erina. Try drawing this bigger. Very good. Is this me? Have you heard about the cops? They're snooping around thinking an islander killed the mayor. I was asked about Keita. Why Keita of all people? That's absurd! The murderer is an outsider, right? They only cause trouble. How annoying. When are you leaving? Didn't the murderer escape by boat? We don't know that yet. Please cooperate. You people are annoying, suspecting islanders. Get out of here! You bring bad luck. Yeah, get out of here! Get out! Please calm down, everyone! Please calm down! You're nothing but trouble! Get out! Do something about it, Shin! They treat us like we're the murderers. Sorry, they mean no harm. Nothing like this has ever happened, so everyone seems tense. What a sick display of camaraderie. Everyone from outside the island is their enemy. Typical of a dying town. They'll probably calm down if Komisaka's body is found. Body? What makes you think he's dead? Well, I just think that... there's a possibility he drowned. "Shokichi Yokota Funeral Ceremony" Shokichi. I'm counting on you, Keita. You have to... protect this island. Promise me. We can't get away with this. Are you giving up? Keita, get a grip. You're protecting the island, right? Yoko, what's wrong? Shokichi? Why should we... Please... cooperate with us. Please. Everything we did was for the island's sake. Please. Please. I promised Shokichi I'd protect it. Please. Please. My father loved this island. He was happy that Keita and everyone's efforts have inspired hope. So I intend to support Keita's farm more than ever now. If I can be of some help to the revival of this island, I'm sure it will please my father. What are you doing? That cop, Hatakeyama, seems dogged. I lied that a boar bit me, so just to be safe. Yoko, please take a break. It's OK, I can handle this. Hey, I can't find the mayor's mobile. How about we call it? - No way, it'll leave a call log. Could she have left it at her office? I wonder if she told anyone she was coming here. She's single, so I don't think so. So, what do we do about these three? Let's tell Dr. Yamashita everything. I'm sure he'll write off Dad's death as a heart attack. The grant will fund a new hospital, right? He's looking so forward to that. We can't bring more people into this. No, maybe we should be doing that. We're protecting the island. Let's enlist help from islanders. Then what about Komisaka and the mayor? Komisaka stays put. What? He'll be the one who killed the mayor. So we have to get them to find only the mayor's body. Komisaka's prints will be on the weapons. They'll think he escaped. The cops should leave then. We can dispose of Komisaka's body after that. The mainland? How do we do that? We use a boat. The town has one we could use. What about the key? I know the guy to ask. The mayor is dead? Please, Mr. Noge. Please help us. It's for the island. Thank you so much. I'm sure I would have killed her otherwise. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It doesn't matter if the mayor is gone, but we can't do without our savior! Doc, you've had too much to drink! That's enough! It's time for us to unite again! OK? We'll all support Keita! We get 500 million yen with those figs. I'll do my best to fill in for the mayor. Let's all support Keita and reinvigorate this island! What do you want? You're old friends with Izumi and Tanabe. We're collecting their DNA. You get it. Ow! Moriya, I agree with you. Komisaka is dead. And his body... is still on this island. Day 4 Careful now! Don't trip! You win. Find any? - Not yet. You see any? Hey, let's leave this island. Things might be hard, but we can grow figs on the mainland. Why? The farm is doing fine. You might be uneasy now because of the cops, but things will settle down. It makes me sick. All that stuff about savior and uniting. Pinning all the responsibility on you. I don't like it. It's like you're becoming someone else. Ever since our parents died, we were able to survive thanks to the islanders. This island is what's keeping us alive. We can't survive outside of this island. I don't think so. Kana, don't worry. I can't find Kana. "Island Ferry Accident Monument" Don't worry. I'll be by your side. Thanks. Dad! You picked one? Great! Mom's over there. - Mom! Erina picked one. - Great! See? - Wow! I'm impressed. - Thanks. Come see the ones I picked. Why don't we bury the body underneath the figs? We could keep an eye on it every day by pretending to work. Plus, the cops searched here first so they won't do it again. But Hatakeyama is still snooping around. He already suspects Shin and me, so maybe Mr. Noge could distract him to buy us some time. I really can't stand lying anymore. I get you. We can't all be level-headed like Keita. Hatakeyama definitely thinks we're suspicious. And his hunch about Komisaka is right. We'll handle it. They haven't found the body yet. It's all my fault. For offering to be a scab. But I... have an obligation to protect this island and everyone here. I have to become a scab. Hi there. Oh, Mom. Is something wrong? I was actually wondering if something was wrong with you. You've been acting strange lately. Yeah? Nothing, I'm fine. Shin. I don't know what's going on, but please don't ever lie. Shin is from "truth". Being sincere comes first. That's why your late father named you Shin. I know that. Come on, sit up straight. You've become a fine policeman and returned to this island. I'm so proud of you. Oh yeah. Remember you mentioned buying me something with your bonus? I've decided. It'll get colder, so I'd like a down jacket. Sound OK? OK, sure. Great. I brought you lunch. Your favorite stewed veggies and last night's leftover oden stew. I'll buy you some rice balls later. I'll leave these here, then. So the mayor was the one in charge of the boat's key? Thank you for your time. - No problem. Um, if you have time, would you like to have dinner together? The diner called to tell me that they got good boar meat. Is that the one Mr. Tanabe caught? No, it's not hunting season now, so it's illegal to catch them. Besides, we don't eat the ones hit by a car. He's probably done away with that boar by now. Hit by a car? Not trapped? Trapped? What are you talking about? What's wrong? The refrigerator. What about dinner? Hey, what's the... Oh no. Moriya speaking. Come now to Tanabe's warehouse. You know what's in that refrigerator, don't you? What do you want? What's going on? Open the refrigerator. I told you, I can't. No outsiders are allowed inside. Stop! Stop! - Don't move! What the hell is wrong with you? Show me your wound. Why? I told you, I got bit by a boar. - Show me the bite, then! What the hell? Hurry up and find the murderer! He's not here anymore, is he? Get lost! Stop disturbing our lives! He endangered your lives so you killed him. Give me a break! Komisaka is dead, isn't he? That's why you can go out at night, huh? How should I know? We found his resume on your property. You met him, didn't you? What resume? You killed Komisaka, didn't you? Did you kill the mayor, too? Who else is involved? Are all the old islanders conspiring? - Shut the hell up! Stop doubting the islanders! What do you know? What on earth are you trying to protect? What is it? That idiot. What was that gunshot? - I don't know. Get in. Move! Moriya! Mori... Shin! Shin. Don't touch him. Don't touch him! Let go of me! Let go of that. Let go of it! Stop shooting! A man shot himself in the police box in Shishikari Town. Please hurry. Don't come in! Hitomi! He's my son! He's my son! Calm down! Let go! He's my son! - Please calm down! Shin! He's my son! - Please calm down! Get in the car for now. Get in! Hitomi. Everyone. I'm so sorry. I was... lying all this time. The person who killed Mutsuo Komisaka and the mayor is... Did you tell Shin we moved the body? He said he couldn't lie anymore. So I didn't want to drag him in any further. Why? When he learned Hatakeyama was checking the warehouse, it was the last straw. Why didn't you tell him? Moriya... confessed everything before he died. Everything about you, too. What the hell are you talking about? You people cornered him. All he ever wanted was to be the island's resident officer. You're the ones who crushed that dream. You and everyone else living here. Come to headquarters. We'll come, but could you make it tomorrow? We just lost our best friend. The person who killed Mutsuo Komisaka and the mayor is... me. I did it all by myself. When I happened to question Komisaka, he attacked me. We got into a scuffle, and I accidentally killed him. And then, the mayor found out about it. I've... always loved this island, and my dream was to become the policeman stationed here. After I finally realized that dream, why did I... But... I tried to be a scab. Please forgive me. I wanted... to protect this island and everyone. Mom. I'm sorry I lied. I'm sorry I couldn't buy you a new down jacket. Shin said that he had to protect the island until the very end. He probably thought our lie wouldn't hold unless he killed himself. Why did Shin... Why? I don't want anyone else to die. If you know what's going on, tell me. We're family, aren't we? Tell me, Keita! The refrigerator, the smartphone... We have no more leads. No, if we can find Komisaka's body... Please go home for today! - That cop was about to shoot Keita! Why'd she point her gun at him? What the hell? Why? Explain yourselves! Please calm down! - Keita wouldn't... What do you think you're doing? What's wrong with you people? Keita! "From: Town Hall" "The body is under the figs." "The murderer is Keita Izumi." Damn it, who did this? Did someone see you bury it? No way! It's impossible to see from afar. Who betrayed us? Why would they? I don't know! Yamashita? Noge? That cop barged into the warehouse because of Noge. But what for? We're all in it together! What about Kana? She thinks you're hiding something. So what? You think she'd snitch on me even if she did? I'm going down the possibilities! - Stop messing around! Get a grip, man. Get a grip. Someone has betrayed us. A text sent from the mayor's missing phone. It can't be an outsider. Someone had it. Shin was the one looking for it that time. You think it was me? Going down the possibilities, right? You're doubting me? Why? Why would I do that? After all that we've been through... They're getting closer! What do we do? - Calm down! Think! What should we do? Shit! Do we force them to stop? What do we do? Are we done for? You're giving up? Think! This isn't just our problem anymore. Everyone is involved! I know that! Shin... Shin died. We can't let his death go to waste! - Then what do you suggest? We're all out of options! What the hell? Shit! It's not over yet. Remember what the mayor said? I'll take the blame. Who cares about that weird text? We don't have to both be arrested. Just me is enough. You knew nothing. Keep saying that. Don't stop lying, OK? Say something, man! You have Kana and Erina. I have nothing. The mayor was right. Nobody needs me. You think so, too, don't you? What? All right. I'll turn myself in. Why? It won't work. You can't cover it all up. All the evidence belongs to me. And the body is in my field. And Jun... I don't think that at all. Take care of Kana and Erina and the island. Hey, wait! No, don't, don't! Keita! What's this text? Kana, I'm sorry. - What's this all about? I'm sorry. I should have known. A guy like you would never feed figs grown over a corpse to anyone. Right? Your precious figs are properly protected by the planters in here. Just like you tried to protect the islanders. Right? The body's in here. I did it. I'll be a scab. I'll take all the blame. That's what I thought. I had to protect these figs. I had to protect Kana and Erina and the islanders. That's why I did it. All done. Kana, isn't it almost time? I'll make lunch so go now. Sorry. Drawing, huh? Your mom's going shopping. Where's Dad? - Your dad... went somewhere a bit far. You can't see him for a while. He went without me and Mom? You've been a good girl, so he might come home soon. "Moriya Family Grave" What are you doing? Moriya's death was the only surprise, huh? What do you mean, "only"? Are you happy now? What? What do you mean? Keita Izumi... married a childhood friend and was blessed with a daughter. He ran a successful farm and became the island's savior overnight. He got everything you ever wanted. You envied him, didn't you? How long did you plan this? Blaming your best friend for everything. Why don't you do something good for the island for once in your life? Hey, I can't find the mayor's mobile. You're protecting the island, right? What do we do? "Please Pay Here" Have one of these. I'll be here if you need anything. Great! See? - Wow! I'm impressed. - Thanks. Come see the ones I picked. Why don't we bury the body underneath the figs? We could keep an eye on it every day by pretending to work. Plus, the cops searched here first so they won't do it again. Tell me, Keita! "Island Ferry Accident Monument" I can't find Kana. Don't worry. I'll be by your side. Thanks. Don't think this is over. Thanks, Jun. It's almost hunting season, so you don't have to help anymore. Do what you want to do. I don't mind. I'm going to wait for Keita forever. How are you? Keita, do you remember? Erina made this. "When we woke up in the morning, sunflowers were in bloom," "Mom/Erina/Uncle Jun/Dad" "so we all went to the amusement park". "It was really hot," "so we had some ice cream". "It was really good". I'm so sorry. I don't want to be tied to the island. I always tried to act strong and did my best, but I won't hold back anymore. I'll protect you from now on, just like you did for me. Kana. About Jun... Believe in him, OK? I always ignored his true feelings. If only I'd faced him... this might not have happened. "When we woke up in the morning," "sunflowers were in bloom," "so we all went..." "to the amusement park." "It was really hot," "so we had some ice cream." "It was really good."
