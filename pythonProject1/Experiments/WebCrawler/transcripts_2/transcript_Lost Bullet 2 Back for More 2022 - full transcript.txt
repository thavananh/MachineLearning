Don't worry. You did it. Areski will do everything he can to get the evidence. He's on the run. He left everything behind. His wife, his kid. Everyone's looking for him. I promise we'll get him. You need to talk to Marco. I'm sure he knows where he is. POLICE Tell me you went to the farm, Julia. Tell me you arrested that son of a bitch. I went to the farm. I saw what he did to your brother. I'm sorry. Where's Marco? That's impossible. - Lino... - I cuffed him myself. There's no way he got away on his own. Someone helped him. Lino, listen. You should've listened to me. Why didn't I kill him? - Let me explain. - There's nothing to explain. I need to be alone. - You did the right thing. - We're making a huge mistake. Why didn't you notify the precinct? We're not telling anyone. We need to talk, Julia. HAIR SALON Lino, it's been six months. Areski isn't coming back. Not for me or his son. I don't want to get you in trouble, but you have to stop following me 24/7. Okay? Get out. When was the last time you slept? Shit, Lino. Hey! I've got my guys outside her place. Everyone's being tapped. Even his parents. She's terrified. Don't make it worse. Let's go. Move on, Lino. It's what Charas would have wanted. What do you know about it? Suspicious vehicle on Highway D60. Waiting for confirmation. Traffic is at a crawl. Accident reported at Kilometer 130. It's him again. Should we tell Julia? If he wants to waste time here with us, let him. You scared she'll ask you to get rid of him? He snuck up on me. - It wouldn't have happened if I was there. - Sure. He took out ten cops, but you would have stopped him. Wanna see? Sure. Go ahead. Gunshots reported on Boulevard de I'Europe. Requesting local units to respond immediately. Stella. Areski sent us. Get out of here! Shit. Hey, you guys! Areski sent them. That bastard is connected. - I want to be at the interrogation. - No way. It's for cops only. You've had six months to get it together. I'm fed up. You want to help me find Areski? Don't half-ass it. If you come tomorrow, you're in. Charas didn't give you a chance so you could live like a hobo. - I don't need charity. - Relax, they're not to my place. Last chance, buddy. Okay. Let's get you fixed up. One thing, though. I hope you like blue. ONE YEAR LATER We got the info from an informer. They hit the road earlier than expected. We can't let them cross the border. The Civil Guard will be waiting for them. Delta, bring up the rear. Victoria, channel two. Yann is on site. Don't come back empty-handed. Okay. Let's go. Delta, we're taking over. Yann, block the ramp! Do I go for it or not? - Yes or no? - Go ahead. Two cars driving in the wrong direction. The French police are involved. The Spanish! Precinct, we just crossed the border. Ready to intercept. Now, Lino. Ana, we intercepted the car. The road is blocked. Traffic stopped until further notice. The ambulance is on its way. France is over there. This is Spain. Didn't Charas explain? At least he followed the rules. - Be careful with French license plates. - Understood. CIVIL GUARD Thanks for the bust. Keep the guys, but I'm taking the dope. Anything that crosses the border is mine. I scratched my ride catching these assholes. Your shitty car was already scratched. Okay? - Do you know who this car belonged to? - Yes. Well, then? Give me that. Lino? Here. Charas was my friend. I know what you lost that day. I'll never forgive myself for recommending Marco to Charas. Marco betrayed me. God only knows how many kilos of dope he and Areski let through. - When they slip up, I'll be there. - You forget they're wanted in Spain too. So we both want to catch them. I'll send a photo when I catch them. Keep 'em. I don't want you to leave empty-handed. - You held your own earlier. - Thanks. Too bad Yann didn't block off the ramp. We'd have had ten kilos. Hey, we seized half a pack of smokes. Alvaro's a good guy. Fine by me. So long as he doesn't nab Marco before I do. Want to grab a beer? - A beer? - Yes, a beer. Just you and me or with the others. I don't know. Whatever you want. I can't tonight. But come by my place this weekend. Right, this weekend. Lino! - Yeah? - The intel was good. He's there. So take him out already. Too risky. Exposed area, single entrance, two cameras outside. I can't make it look like an accident. I need 48 hours. We don't have 48 hours, Youri. They could move him at any time. I won't risk leading my men into a trap. Sorry, commander. You're leaving me no choice. Plan B. I'll send you the info. Wait for my signal. - Yeah. - Yeah. You know that won't protect you, right? Start it up. - Hit it. I want to see how long it lasts. - I am hitting it. Victoria? Less power. Then hit it again. - You sure? - Come on! Fuck. - What gives? - You're gonna get killed. Take that shit off. You don't need it if you know how to drive. Hello? - Lino? - Yes, speaking. I'm Mado's caretaker. She's your adoptive mother, correct? More like my guardian, but... How is she? Not very well, actually. She's very ill. She would like to see your brother Quentin. Do you know how I can reach him? It'll be hard. He died last year. Ah, I'm very sorry to hear that. It's my fault. I should have visited a long time ago. You can come today if you want. Could you give me her address, please? I'll send it. But I'll warn you, it's pretty remote. - Okay. I'll leave now. - See you soon. - He'll be there in an hour. - No one can resist a call from Mommy. Hey. We won't end up like Areski. I promise. - Yes? - What did you tell Lino? - Sorry? - He's at the hideout. If he kills him, Julia... I'm on my way. Julia? Back already? I'm going to start thinking you can't live without... Fuck. Pick up. Lino? Lino? Don't move. Stay where you are. Don't touch Marco. Lino, please. I'll explain. Just wait until I get there. Answer me, Lino. Victoria, this is Julia. Go ahead. Get me a location on Lino. Lino! Get out. Tell me where Areski is. Nobody knows where he is. - Lino, come with me. - I don't think so. This SOB was under my nose for a year. I've been lied to, but why? - Go on. - Hey. Hello? This wasn't part of the deal. What deal? How did you find him? Anonymous call. A well-informed woman. It's them. You can be sure they're already on their way. - Julia's coming to get you out. - Hey. Nobody's leaving until you tell me who you're talking about. Alexander Resz. The head of Narcotics. It's him, and he wanted Lino to do his dirty work. To make it look like revenge. Why would a cop want him dead? Aside from me. You think Areski and I worked alone? You think we answered to no one? If Resz was in on it from the start, why don't you take him down now? Not enough evidence. Without Areski, the case isn't strong enough. In the meantime, I'm protecting our only witness. I brought him in alive, didn't I? I could have killed the piece of shit. That's not what I want. - What do you want? - I want him to pay! When all this is over, will he go to jail over my brother? That's all I want to know. Yes, he'll go to jail. - Tell him the truth. - Shut up. He deserves to know. You're going to let him walk? He'll stay in the witness protection program. A new start. He rats on three dirty cops, and you let him go? These aren't just any dirty cops, Lino. - Did Julia know? - Did she know what? That he would walk! Yes, she knew. - Julia, where are you? - I'm almost to town. - Okay. Resz is the one behind all this. - Shit. - You need to get Marco out. - What about Lino? - He knows everything. I had no choice. - I told you this was a mistake. Julia? Don't leave Lino without surveillance. - What can he do? - You can't protect me. Let me go. No. As long as I'm with you, Alexander will find me. I'm not turning a child killer loose. The kid? He wasn't so important when you offered me the deal. Open your trap again, and I'll let Lino have you. Moss? Youri Baptista. I'm under Captain Alexander Resz's orders. In the search for fugitive Areski Novak, you are to turn over any information or person that might lead to his capture. Get rid of them and we'll talk. No. Hey, whoa. I know his partner Marco Lopez is here. I've come to get him. He's not here. Where are we going? We got him. Pull the car into the parking lot. Don't move. He just escaped! Around to the other side. Go! Hey! Move it. Lino, stop! Let him go! Get him, damn it! Come on! Let him go! Hold him down! Don't move! Stop moving! Stop moving! Go! After the accident on Highway 343, the crashed cars have been removed. Traffic has returned to normal. Nothing else to report. Over and out. Alvaro, it's Lino. What's with the photo? I'm an hour from the border. You still want Marco or not? Then listen carefully. Precinct here. Active pursuit of a Renault 21. All units to the area. Suspect has a hostage in the trunk. - What's this shit, Moss? - It's Lino. He kidnapped Marco. I know where he's going. - If he turns him over to the Spanish... - I know. I'm on it. Over! Hurry up! 5 - ANDORRA Shit. We're losing him. He's headed for Verdanson. I repeat, he's headed for Verdanson. Almost to the canal. I'm on my way. She's fine. She's fine. Julia, are you okay? You ride with Victoria. You're in no condition to drive. Let me drive! There were dozens of witnesses. We were at the station. I wasn't going to kill Marco in front of everyone. This asshole will take us all down. I'm starting to miss Areski. Take him out, or I'll get involved. Make a list of checkpoints from here to the border, and reroute everyone to me. Backup requested at checkpoints D60, D65, A750, D618, D914, D2... Lino. Julia? Julia, talk to me. Are you hurt? I'm coming, Lino. I'm going to kill you. - Fuck, I thought you were dead. - You're gonna wish I was. Now pull over. You know I can't. - What are you trying to do? - The only thing worth doing. There's a checkpoint. You're fucking up your life. Stella, the kid... I can't let him go free. Not this time, Julia. - Let me help you! - Go to hell! - Lino! - You knew Marco would walk! - You think I had a choice? - Now I don't have one. You're killing Charas all over again. And you'll never hold a candle to him. - Ask yourself what he would have done. - Lino! Keep coming. Attention all cars, traffic will alternate. Yeah, we're here. Nothing at the other checkpoints, but his phone stopped pinging. Julia, you need to see a doctor. No. I know he's still here. It's over, man. Everyone's looking for us now. Alex will kill us and Julia too. You'll never cross the border. PEST CONTROL, SANITATION There's a checkpoint ten kilometers away. They're just letting the cars go through. Should be fine. Be right back. Good to see you again. Fuck off. He'll be tried. You have my word. Keep your phone on. Julia's not the only one after him. What's your plan? To buy you as much time as I can. - Thanks, Alvaro. - Will you explain it to me someday? Charas would be proud. Hello? I don't know how to say this... There's no need. I already know. I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry. Lino... - To put you through that again... - Lino. I know. You're not Areski. It's because you're stubborn and never listen to anyone still alive. I don't know what you're up to, but finish what you started. And stay alive. Got it. I'll hang up before they ping your phone. I love you. Precinct here. Vehicle headed southbound on D67 toward the main checkpoint. Tail it. I'm on my way. Yann, you're in charge of the checkpoint. Keep it down back there, okay? Whatever you do, go the speed limit. Easy. I love this guy. Come on. We're almost there. Come on. Lino! Shit! I got him. State your location for backup. Back up. I repeat, state your location. On your knees. On your knees. - Yann, this is Julia. - Go ahead. Search every vehicle. Inspect all of them. Lino doesn't have Marco. - I repeat, Lino doesn't have Marco. - Okay, roger that. Search all the cars. Go! Spike strip! Shit. What do we do? Who helped you? - Alvaro is as dumb as you are. - Alvaro still has principles. Charas was his friend for a reason. Open the trunk, please. Okay. You're good. - Turn around. Get out of line. - You sure? - We'll go via the port. - What? We have no choice. Come on. Julia, this is Yann. Suspicious white van with Spanish plates at the checkpoint. Did you stop it? No, it turned around and took the D65. Permission to follow? Stay and keep searching the cars. But, Julia... Last chance to save Alvaro. - Victoria, this is Julia. - Go ahead. Set up a checkpoint on D65. We're looking for a white van with Spanish plates. Top priority. - Victoria? - There's already a checkpoint there. - Who authorized it? - Captain Resz. We need to warn Alvaro now. Go on. Do as they say. Lino? Alvaro, they set a trap for you. Turn around. I want to talk to Lino. Alvaro, I'm here! They want to kill Marco. They'll kill you too. What do we do? Sorry, Julia. There's no turning back. Go on. Step on it! You okay? Everything okay? I'm fine! So is the cargo. But what's going on? Let me go. Fuck! - Pull over. - I'm fine. - Pull over! - No, I'm fine! My driver's been hit. We've lost them, but not for long. Where are you? Ten kilometers from the border, but we won't make it. Find somewhere to hide. I'll send all I've got. What are you doing? We're closest. Victoria, this is Julia. All units to my location. Send an ambulance. If we stay here, they'll have no chance. It'll be too late. You need me. This isn't over between us. They'll be back. - How do you feel? - I'm fine. Put pressure on it. I'll drive. They'll kill us all. They'll kill us all. I'm the one they want. Alvaro, let me go. Hey! Shit. Alvaro! This is my problem. Let me go. You've got two choices. Prison or you die here. No! There's no time! Get in. Come on. You got this. Julio, you got this. Julia. I think that's Julia. Come on. You got this. Come on. We're almost there. Come on. Just a bit farther. We're almost there. Did you see that? He's insane. Son of a bitch. Watch out! Fuck! Marco, get in. - Fuck, speed up! - I know what I'm doing. Julia. We need to go. Hey, Yann! Stop! On your feet. It's all good. I have Marco. It's over. Orders from Moss. Moss, this is Julia. Julia, get Marco out of there. I'll contact you in ten with a meeting point. - I'm not moving 'til you let Lino go. - You don't have a choice. I'll take care of him. Focus on protecting Marco. The threat has been eliminated. Lino is under arrest. There's nothing you can do. Listen, get out of there! No, you listen to me. If you arrest him, I'll give Marco to the Spanish myself. Is that clear? You're going to screw it all up. Tell Yann to let him go. You know I can't do that, Julia. You made a deal with a murderer. Julia. Julia! Julia! Julia? What's going on? Julia? What's going on? Julia! Julia! Victoria! Get back in! Look. I'm all right. Take care of him. Fuck. Don't just stand there. He needs you. Damn it! WELCOME TO SPAIN FRENCH SPOKEN HERE Police. Police! The cars are on the way. Stay on the line until they arrive. Okay? Please don't hang up, ma'am. I'm not going with you, Julia. Drop the gun. Let him go. Don't be stupid. Do what he says. Slide the gun over. Shit. Shit. He can't die. God, I'm fucked. Precinct. Code 10-01. Precinct, come in! Answer, damn it. Victoria, this is Julia. Answer, damn it. RESTAURANT CHA KAO Fuck. Look after Stella and the kid. Okay? Okay. There was a struggle. He tried to run. I had no choice. I fired. He had no chance. A whole year's work. A case file as thick as a brick, and we can't use any of it. - Your mission was to protect him. - Fuck the mission. I killed Marco. - Lino killed Marco. - No. He got what he wanted. He got his revenge. - He was protecting me. - Say what you want. It makes no difference. Lino killed Marco. Period. When the Spanish are done with him, they'll want answers. So we'll play the hand Lino dealt us, and pin it all on him. And we'll be fine. I'm done lying for you. I quit. This is all the cops left behind. It didn't bring much luck to its previous owner. Did you know him? I'll take it. I'll take the van out front too. What will you do with the bike? Whatever you want. It's yours. Want to see what else I have in stock? No. This is perfect for family trips. Subtitle translation by: Emily Moorlach Subtitle translation by Emily Moorlach
