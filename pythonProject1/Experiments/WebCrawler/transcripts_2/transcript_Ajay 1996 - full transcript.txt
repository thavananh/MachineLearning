"He removes the troubles of devotees in moments.." "Om Jai Jagdish.." "Om Jai Jagdish.." "He removes the troubles of devotees in moments.." "Om Jai Jagdish.." I salute you Raja Sir! Your kingdom is gone but the customs are still in place. Going by your grandiose and the flamboyance.. ..it appears as if times haven't changed. I shall not allow times to change, Kedarnath. I shall not allow the style, splendor, and grandiosity.. ..that has been here through so many generations.. ..to be shattered so easily. Anyway. I have brought up Manorama with great love. She has absolutely forgotten here parents who passed away. Now we are her parents. We have only one niece. Just consider that we are handing over.. ..a piece of our heart into your household. The almanac of Rama and Rupesh will match anyway. Rama will complete her education and return to India.. ..and.. And shall we consider this match to be final in a way? Consider it final? Consider that it has been sealed! Greetings! Greetings Lala. Come. Come! Salutations to you, Raja Sir. Please meet him. He is our.. Tail. My lord. Tail! Unless he meets me he will not be able to eat a morsel of food. Prince, our child is very simple, very innocent. She is as mild as a cow. A cow. She doesn't have a tongue in her mouth. She is mute! Dumb! Lala! Sorry my Lord. My tongue just slipped. Raja sir, allow us to leave. It is dusk and we have a long way ahead. All right Kedarnath. See them off at the car. Greetings. Young King! - Durga! Yes, Young King. You didn't call for me that is why I have come. Why would I call for you? Have you forgotten? Isn't that what you said? I said it and you believed me, did you? What about the sacred circles in front of God. Was that just for show? Was that a farce? Durga, depending on the kinds of girls I am forced to set the net. Some are pleased by money. Some with gifts. But you? You were very different from all of them. That is why I had to go through the sham of marriage with you. Look, Durga. The night is passed and so it the matter. The night has not passed, Young King. That night is taken shape of your heir in my womb. I am going to be a mother to your child. My child? What proof do you have? God knows that.. Which God are you talking about? Is it the same God who has to leave the precincts of a temple.. ..to come to my door step and give blessings? Trust me. The baby in my womb is yours. How do I believe that this child is mine? Who knows who else has fathered that bastard before me? Ranvir! What is the matter? Raja Sir, this woman bears somebody's child and.. ..wants to blame Young King for it. She shouts. She says that.. Lala! Go inside. King! King! This is not a sin. This is the blood of your clan. Don't give such a harsh punishment.. ..to the innocent child that is not born yet. Please do justice. Please do justice, Raja Sir. Justice will be done to you! Surely! No! No! Leave me! My baby! Didn't you say that it was my brother's sin? Now it has been washed off. Tyrants! You have harassed me a lot! You have bestowed on me many cruelties. You forgot that when the chest of a destitute cracks.. ..then pain comes out of it and the agony reaches God! And it befalls you in the form of mayhem.. ..and shatters your hollow flamboyance to smithereens! Each and every curse of mine will hit you like the cane of God. Just like this unfortunate woman pleads in front of you for her.. ..esteem one day you too will implore.. ..to some wretched being for your life. But you will not get the alms. Never get the alms you seek. You have washed your floor with my blood, Ranvir Singh! I shall wash my hair with your blood. Till such time that my words don't come true I shall not tie my hair! Someday a light from a hut will set fire to this palace of yours. And in that fire your ego will burn to ashes! Brijraj Singh! This is my curse! This is my curse! This is my curse! Brother Ajay! Brother Ajay! Rupaiyya, has picked up a fight with his father again. Come fast. I feel that probably you are not my son. I too feel that you are not my father I am not at all your father. The man who raises his voice against the Raja Sir! The man challenges the rule of Raja Sir! lf my offspring wants to marry that man's.. ..daughter then I'd rather disown that offspring. I too had promised my dead mother that.. ..I would not marry without your consent. Otherwise I would not accept your domination! After all these years of being a sidekick to Raja Sir.. How dare you call your father a sidekick? What else can I call you? What do you say, Gullu? Yes, because.. Raja gave Lala the chutney.. ..to taste from a silver spoon. Shut up! How dare you poke fun at me? Hey Rupaiyya! Why do you keep fighting with your father? He too doesn't give up on being a supporter of Raja Sir. How many times have I told him to stand by truth not wealth? Ajay Son, come and have your breakfast. - Coming mother. Lucky man! There is no water. Thank you. Mother! Listen! Oh God! What is this childish prank? Mother, throw her out of the house as soon as possible. Get her married and send her away. Come on have your breakfast. Come. Mother, he keeps talking about getting me married dawn to dusk. Keeps talking about sending me out of this house. Mother, don't get carried away by what she says. As soon as possible get her married to someone. Anyone. Lame or cripple! Maybe a horse or donkey! Hey! I will get married to somebody.. ..who is lame or cripple. And you will get married to a princess. Yes. I will get married to a princess. Why not? I will get married to a princess only. What is all this, uncle? Rama, they all have come to greet you, to welcome you. To greet me! Do I seem to be some show piece to all of you? I don't want anybody to welcome me. Go and do your work. Out! Out! But daughter, a welcoming ceremony like this.. ..is a part of our culture. It is according to our customs and traditions. Hey, uncle! Customs and traditions! - Yes. Where is big uncle? - He is inside. Big uncle! - Rama! Rama! My daughter! How are you? - I am very angry with you. Why? - In which jungle have you invited me? This is such a boring place. Hey! This time I will not let you get bored at all. Do you know why? Because this time I have decided to do your engagement. Engagement! With whom? With an Indian fellow! I don't want to get married so quickly. Where am I asking you to get married immediately? Hey! You have come right now. Roam about at different places. Relax, Rama! Enjoy yourself. Hey girl! Just take Rama to her room. Fine. Brother, is this a girl or some hurricane? She will be like a hurricane only. After all whose daughter is she! The queen of dreams! What are you staring at me for? - Your beauty. How dare you? Put me down. Hey! You are very ungrateful to me! First of all, I saved you from drowning. And on top of that, you are yelling at me. You would have drowned. lf I had drowned then I would have drowned. Who are you to yell at me? Just put me down. I told you to put me down. Don't you know that who am I? The queen of my dreams. I am not the queen of dreams but I am indeed a queen. Whoever you are, I swear by God that you are awesome. I really feel like being romantic with you. But I am in a hurry. We will meet again. Madam! Madam! Who is this beast? Beast! He is not a beast. But he is a human being. And his name is Ajay. All the girls in the village are crazy about him. But he never pays attention to anybody. Last year, during the ox fight, he had only won. And he will only win this time also. The inhabitants of Kishengadh, with the blessings.. ..of the great Thakur family, like every year.. ..even today I begin with this cultural festival. Wow! The king has nurtured such a good ox. Even the great men's are unable to face him.. Yes! You are absolutely right, father. The king has nurtured such a great ox.. - Shut up! Come, young men's! Come! Is there any brave man who will risk his life in danger? Any young man who would like to test his might? Tell me, is there anybody? Come on. Come on. Come forward. Is there any such young man? Uncle, I will come back right now. Is there anybody who will be able to handle this beast? Tell me, is there anybody? I think that there is nobody. Nobody! Is there nobody who will be able to handle this beats? I think that indeed there is no real man in this city. You should not challenge the manhood of men's. Let go of my hand. I told you to let go of my hand. Not throughout my entire life. lf you want to prove your manhood.. ..then first of all, triumph in this competition. You will get whatever you will ask for. Really! What can you offer as reward? - 50000 rupees. This reward is very ordinary. What I want is.. What happened? Look, my friend is going. Foolish guy! Even he will lose. Father, let's have a bet. - What is the bet? lf Ajay will win then I will myself blacken your face. And if that ox will win then? Then blacken yourself by you won hands. Hey!

Why did you shatter my milk cans? Why did you tie my scarf on your car? - To wipe my nose. How dare you! Don't you know that who am I? I know that who are you, madam. But maybe you don't know that who are you? I will have to remind you. Let go for me. I will get you imprisoned. Where are you taking me? - To your in-law's house. Open my hands. Open my hands.

Will you all ask for alms from a poor person? Will you all ask for alms from a poor person? Wait. Wait. Wait. I will give you some charity. Until today, people have fulfilled the ritual.. ..of giving away of the daughter. Today I will give away my son. Anyway, my son is completely useless to me. Take him away as charity. Go. But Lala. Lala -Hey, Lala! We don't want any charity. Why are you all wasting you time over here? You all will not get any charity over here. Go away. Go away. Where have they come to ask for alms? They have come to ask for alms from a beggar. Hey! Get lost! Get lost! They have come to ask for alms from Lala! You don't have money, right? I will teach you a lesson right now.

You have tried to ruin Lala, right? lf I will also not ruin your life then I will change my name. Priest. Priest. Please open the doors of the temple. Look, the time for Lord Krishna's birth is passing away. What are you saying, daughter? Like every year,.. ..the king will only open the door this time also. Hey! But if the king will not.. .. come then will the God not be born? Can he God's birth wait for anybody? It can wait for us. Who are you? And how did you dare to step.. ..on the stairs of our temple? But the temple belongs to God. The temple may be of the God but.. ..it has been built with our money. lf you were so keen to built a temple.. ..then you should have built it in your palace. The temple belongs to everybody. And anybody can climb its stairs. A rich person as well as a poor person. Okay. So you are very fond of arguing. Come on. Then argue with me. Let go of me. Let go of me. I told you to let go of me. Hey! Come on. -Brother! Ajay! Son Ajay, stop! Stop! Please leave him. Ajay! What are you doing? - Leave him, brother. Mother, how did he touch my sister? - Ranvir! Stop! Let go of him. - Let go of him. Let it be, son. You should not shed blood.. ..on the stairs of the temple. - A tiger doesn't compete with a dog. Listen to me. You have my sake. Come on, let it be. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Son Ajay! Are you angry with your mother? By the way, shall I tell you something? I have experienced life more than you. The people against whom you were fighting.. ..it will be better to stay away from them. Anyway, it is said that we should not play with fire. Ajay! Ajay! What did you do, my son? Mother, I know how to play with the fire. And I know how to extinguish it also. Oh! The princess of dreams! I have come to explain the reality to you. Did you see that your reality is at my feet? By the way, this net is very beautiful. You will not be able to free yourself from it. By the way, who wants to come out of it? It is the dirt of your mind. After all, what is your status and what is my status? I am that princess who stays in the heights of the skies. And you are an ordinary worm who crawls on the ground. You will never be able to wipe out these differences. By wearing a show which has a heel of four inch high.. ..nobody is able to touch the skies, madam. When you will fall down then.. ..this land will only take care of you. We will watch out the consequences at that time. But today you are at the stage of my mercy. Listen to me. The way I am trapped.. ..it is not my helplessness but it is my wish. What do you mean? You will come to know about it right now. Get him! Stupid fools! Salutations, brother! - Salutations! What is the matter, brother? When you come across a valley or a lake.. ..just throw these boys into it. Fine. Come on, child. Come on, child. "O pretty Damsel!" "O pretty Damsel!" "O pretty Damsel!" "O pretty Damsel!" "Please walk a bit slowly." "Please walk a bit slowly." "O pretty Damsel!" "O pretty Damsel!" "Please walk a bit slowly." "Please walk a bit slowly." "Otherwise you will slip away." "Otherwise you will slip away." "And your thin waist will be twisted." "And your thin waist will be twisted." "O pretty Damsel!" "O pretty Damsel!" "I am a Punjabi boy." "I am a Punjabi boy." "Listen to me, you rich lady!" "Today I will smatter the glitters from your face." "I am a Punjabi boy." "Listen to me, you rich lady!" "Today I will smatter the glitters from your face." "I will come to your house with the musical procession." "I will bring the horses and elephants also along with me." "I will come very pompously as a King to your house." "I will make you my queen." "I will show you those colors that.." "..you will never forget it throughout your life." "That you will not forget it throughout your life." "O pretty Damsel!" "O pretty Damsel!" "Why are you so engrossed?" "Why are you so engrossed, you silly girl?" "You are the bolt of fire. I am the chilled water." "Why are you so engrossed, you silly girl?" "You are the bolt of fire. I am the chilled water." "lf you will break my heart and go" "then you will not be peaceful at all." "It is my confidence that you will definitely come back." "You will suffer and you will regret." "Gain your consciousness, you silly girl!" "Gain your consciousness, you silly girl!" "O pretty Damsel!" "O pretty Damsel!" "Please walk a bit slowly." "Please walk a bit slowly." "Otherwise you will slip away." "Otherwise you will slip away." "And your thin waist will be twisted." "And your thin waist will be twisted." "O pretty Damsel!" "O pretty Damsel!" I hate him! I hate him! I hate him! Sister, your juice. So you were involved with the.. ..enemy and you were fooling with me. What do you think and what does he think that we will bow down? Love never bends, sister. A woman may stay in a poor man's hut or in the palace. But she is always preferred with her eyes bowed low. But I am not that girl who will bow down. I will only win. Not that Ajay! Greetings, Raja sir. - My blessings, Rupesh. I've called you here because I want that before the.. ..engagement you and Rama should know each other well. Okay, Raja sir. Come, Rama, come. Come, dear. Look, the pride of Bhavanipur.. ..has come to meet the life of Kishengadh. Hello. - But, uncle, I didn't recognize him. Dear, he is Bhavanipur Industries' owner.. ..Kedarnath's only son, Rupesh. Your marriage has been fixed with him only. But, uncle, I don't even know.. I was going to the jungle with my friends for hunting.. Hunting! - Yes. - How exciting! You hunt? - Yes, why? Even I very much feel like hunting a wild animal. Oh, really! Then come with us. With this pretext your wish of hunting will also be fulfilled.. ..and we'll also know each other well. Am I right Raja sir? - Why not. Rama will surely come. Hunting. Hey, milkman! - You! You're here so early in the morning. It looks like in the eagerness of meeting me.. ..you didn't sleep at night. Yes, I didn't sleep the whole night. I was missing you. And as soon as, the sun rose.. ..I came to tell you that now for the rest of your life.. ..you won't be able to sleep at night. Okay. - I'm getting married. Our marriage! So soon! I've still not spoke with mother about this. You're mistaken. I'm getting married to.. ..Bhavanipur's Prince Rupesh Singh. Why? How did you find it? And how dare you dream of marring me! My body, mind will be his possession. He'll be the protector of my honour, respect. My each and every breath will be his. And each night when you'll be agonising for me.. ..I'll be in his strong arms. My palanquin will pass your house. And you won't be able to do anything. You like to be Ranjah, don't you? So today I'll make you Majnu from Kehes. That Majnu, who never got Laila. That Majnu who wandered in the desert. Whom the people threw stones at. And the foolish Laila saved his Majnu from the stones. But I.. even I'll throw a stone. Rupesh! Look, there! Leave me! Leave me! Leave! Rupesh! Where are you taking me! This is the Prince, isn't he? Whose strong arms will protect you for the entire life! What is entire life! He couldn't even protect you for a night. Girls like you, who don't care for other's honour.. ..their guardian of honour will be people like him. What will you reject my love! You are not even worthy for my hatred, leave aside love. Rama! Rama! Rama.. whatever happened last night.. ..actually I wasn't in my senses, Rama. I apologize for my friends' misbehavior. Rama! Misbehavior! I thought that this must be.. ..some great tradition of your family. That the bride has to first be the keep.. ..of the bridegroom's friends. Rama! - Don't shout! When weak people like you are reminded of.. ..their weakness they can do nothing but raise their voice. You're crossing your limits, Rama! Don't forget that you're my fiancé! Fiancé! And that too yours! lf my uncle comes to know what Bhavanipur's pride.. ..did with the life of Kishengadh.. ..then there will be bloodsheds. Along with Bhavanipur, he'll also turn you into dust. Rama.. how was your hunting? Interesting. Very interesting. - Indeed. And Rupesh? How was he? Uncle, in this hunt.. I very well came to know.. ..the difference between lion and fox. Really! So what did you think? I didn't think, I've decided. Very good, so I'll.. - What's the hurry, uncle? When the time comes I'll tell you that.. - That.. When the time comes. Hit her more! Hit! Hit her more! Hit her! Hit! Hit! Don't leave her! Hit her! Hit her more! Hit! Hit her more! Hit her! Hit her more! Hit! Hit her more! Hit her! Stop! Why are you hitting her! What did she do? What did she do! She has become crazy, mad. Day and night she chants the name of her lover. So what? We want to disown her from the village. Don't you feel ashamed! You want to disown a lover! Why are you praising her so much, Ajay brother? Because she has only loved.. ..she also gave her heart to someone. And to love is not a sin. "Stop, lover. Stop, lover." "Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, lover." "Stop, lover. Stop, lover." "Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, lover." "Today you break my heart and go away." "Break and go away, break and go away." "Today you break my heart and go away." "Tomorrow you read in the newspaper." "Today you break my heart and go away." "Tomorrow you read in the newspaper." "As a lover, has died." "As a lover, has died." "A woman in love for her love." "Today you break my heart and go away." "Tomorrow you read in the newspaper." "Today you break my heart and go away." "Tomorrow you read in the newspaper." "As a lover, has died." "As a lover, has died." "A woman in love for her love." "Stop, lover. Stop, lover." "Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, lover." "Stop, lover. Stop, lover." "Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop." "I became crazy in love." "Unknown, stranger." "By stealing my heart, going away from me.." "..why do you do this naive thing?" "By stealing my heart, going away from me.." "..why do you do this naive thing?" "What I don't have!" "This youth is in your name." "Such a lover won't be in this world." "Today you break my heart and go away." "Tomorrow you read in the newspaper." "Today you break my heart and go away." "Tomorrow you read in the newspaper." "Stop, lover. Stop, lover." "Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, lover." "Stop, lover. Stop, lover." "Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop." "People only say.. they don't do it." "Nowadays people don't die in love." "Leave my arms." "Leave my arms." "Every day new rumours are published in the newspaper." "Every day new rumours are published in the newspaper." "Leave me, give up this intention." "Why do you unnecessarily talk about dying?" "Stop, lover. Stop, lover." "Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, lover." "Stop, lover. Stop, lover." "Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, lover." "Today you break my heart and go away." "Tomorrow you read in the newspaper." "As a lover, has died." "As a lover, has died." "A man in love for her love." "Stop, lover. Stop, lover." "Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, lover." "Stop, lover. Stop, lover." "Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop." I knew from before only, the person who has.. ..connections with the royal family, if my daughter.. ..goes in such a family as their daughter-in-law.. ..then it will be a fortunate thing for us. True, true. And Lala, your son is one in a million. And what to say about his style. Your son is a treasure box of virtues. He is a treasure box. That's why I've kept his name as Rupaiya. But there is a problem. - Problem? - Yes. Look, God has given me a gem of a son. Now I don't want anything. What do they say.. dowry. I'm completely against dowry. I don't want dowry. Only weigh my gem of son with diamond.. ..or at least with gold. With gold? - Yes. Okay not gold, at least weigh him with silver. Silver? - Not even silver. Then weigh him with money. With money? - What penniless people are you! You don't have money and you want.. ..your daughter to marry my son. Get out from here! Go on your way! Will my son go in such a penniless house.. ..as a live in son-in-law? I've not kept his name Rupaiya just like that. What are you thinking about? The person who is an orphan since her childhood.. ..and now she is suddenly getting a mother. I fear that if mother will not accept me then? I have complete faith on my love and.. ..my mother has complete trust on my faith. Bhatwari, this place is very beautiful. I like it very much. Whoever it belongs to, just tell him that I have brought it. Bhatwari, that car which is parked there is very beautiful. I like it very much. Whoever it belongs to, tell him that I have brought it. This car belongs to me. And this land belongs to me. And it is not saleable. You are challenging my power. I know how to steal it also. Only time will prove it that who will steal what and from whom? lf you got scared so soon then how will you support me.. ..throughout your life? I have fallen in love. But what will be its consequences? I have not thought about it at all. It is possible that maybe I will not be able to.. ..carry on this relationship. You cannot carry on with it! Then why are falling into this relationship? In order to betray me! In order to promise me and then break the promise! I was just testing the depth of your love. I just wanted to see that if I will change my mind.. ..in some difficult situation then.. ..will you let my love fall off? Or will you handle it? So have you tested my love? Ajay, the energy of your love has.. ..now become the test of my love. I love you, Ajay! I love you! That rascal has maligned our powers and insulted us. And you are asking me to have patience. Why, brother? We will definitely answer this. And we will answer it in our style. When will we do say? When? When he would have already maligned us badly then? He has already maligned the respect of this family.. ..by trapping Rama in his love trap. - Rupesh! lf this will be proved to be false then.. ..blood will not shed from your body but the bombs will. Save these bullets for him who is trying to malign you. There will be no use of wasting it on me. Rama who is the pride of this family and my would-be fiancée.. ..is having a good time in his house and maligning.. ..the fame and pride of this royal family. Mother! Just see that who has come to meet you? Rama! Mother. - Live long, child! You are very beautiful! Only fortunate people get a daughter-in-law like this. But.. - I have understood it, mother. You fear the king. And you are my strength. But son, the king will never accept this relationship. Mother, God makes these relationships, isn't it? Why don't you understand? lf you're insistence and his pride will lead to bloodshed then? Mother, I am ready for that also. It is fine. When you both have decided to become on.. ..the my blessings will always be with the two of you. I feel like making you my daughter-in-law today itself. But sister-in-law, just a minute. Brother has one problem. He is of the opinion that.. ..until I don't get out from this house he will not get married. Your brother is absolutely right. O sister-in-law, even you have been carried away by brother. Rama! Until today, nobody dared to look me into the eye. Until today, nobody tried to malign the pride of our family. Until today, nobody tried to challenge my orders. Until today, this has not happened. What has never happened, it has happened today at least. Shut up! And bow your eyes low. Maybe you have forgotten that who are we? You are the uncle of that girl whom I love. It is good that you all have come here. Anyway, the girl's family only comes with the proposal. Will you join a relationship with our family? You? Are you dreaming about wiping out these distances.. ..among our families? Love wipes out all the distances. It can never happen. lf you will try to clear these distances all your life.. ..then too these distances will not be cleared. We will not let you both unite. Deva! I don't want any bloodshed between us. Rama and I love each other very much. And no one can stop us from uniting. I'm handing over my possession to you. You've come to take Rama, take her. I'll come to take her.. along with the wedding procession. Ajay! You! - Yes, that same wretch.. ..whose first roar of curse has befallen on you today. Whose first drop of tears.. ..showered on you today as acid. The curse from my heart will destroy all of you. There is no force left in your slap, Ranbir. Hey, what are you looking? Use your strength and remove the tree. With your strength you'll go away from here. But how will you face that storm.. ..that is knocking on your palace's door. Come on. Go, Raja sir, you'll be defeated. You'll be defeated. Sir, sir. - Lala, what happened, Lala? What happened? Did a mad dog bite you? Sir, if you'd seen what I saw.. ..then even you would have felt the same thing. What nonsense are you talking? Are you in your right mind? Sir, last night I saw a dream. Such a dream, o my God, that even the 80 crores people.. ..of India must have not seen it. - What? Sir, the entire palace is decorated.. ..as if the heavens have come to your feet. Lakhs of guest, Indian and foreigners. Sir's praises are sung all over the place. Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Will you keep repeating sir or say something further. Sir, I saw in my dream that in Rama's marriage.. ..you had lost everything like the King Harish Chandra.. ..and you were begging with a beggar's bowl in your hand. What rubbish are you taking, Lala! Rama will get married. And it will be with such a grandeur that.. ..not only India's 80 crores but the whole world will watch it. Not in dream.. but in reality. Sir, in my dream I saw that when the bridegroom pushed.. ..aside his veil, it wasn't Rupesh but that rascal Ajay. Lala! How dare you see such a dream! Sir, I think once more my tongue slipped. lf next time your tongue slipped.. ..then I'll cut your tongue. Okay, come on Lala. Raja sir, why such a big punishment for my mistake? Leave palace's dogs, beat me with your slippers. But why are you making these muscled men beat me? I have served you my whole life. Forgive me, Raja sir. Come on, take the car back. - Keep quiet. I've brought you here not to beat you.. ..but for some other purpose. Go inside and tell Tiwari that I want to meet him. I'll just tell him. Open the door. Where's Tiwari? Where's Tiwari?.. Where's Tiwari? Hey, you, where's Tiwari? I'm Tiwari. What purpose brought you here? Raja sir has come to meet you. What! Raja sir has come here! Yes, he is here. Greetings, Raja sir. How come today you remembered this servant? Tiwari there's an urgent work to be done. That's why I've come to you. Some rascal has bellowed my respect. And I want.. I very well know what you want, Raja sir. I'll make his such condition that after today.. ..he'll find himself not on his two legs.. ..but on the four bed poles of the hospital. You tell me his name. - Ajay. The marriage's auspicious date is fixed on the 12th. You all have only 10 days left to do all the preparations. Uncle, you don't worry. Even if the auspicious day had been tomorrow.. ..then too we would have been ready for it. You just bring the marriage procession. Very good, son. Okay, son, okay, sister. I'll take your leave. Greetings. - Greetings. But Ajay, son, how can all this be done so soon. Jewellery.. bride's dress.. are still left to be purchased. Then your pampered sister should also like it. Mother you don't worry about anything. All this will be done in a day. But, brother, for me someone else.. ..will select the marriage dress. - Who? Hello. Hi, Anjali. - Congratulations. For you the doors of this house.. ..are opening on the 12th. Oh! It means your marriage has been fixed for the 12th. And it's my wish that my to be sister-in-law.. ..chooses the marriage dress for me. That's great! Tell your brother that I'm coming. Just wait and see.. ..what a gorgeous marriage dress I select for you. Okay, bye. - Where are you going? It is not necessary to tell you everything. - Rama! Rama! Rama! Move aside! Brother, you know where she is going. And still you're not stopping her. - Let her go. She should also see how the palace.. ..of her dreams shatters in front of her own eyes. Look at this. No. - No. - It isn't good. - No. How is this? No. This is injustice. For Anjali's marriage you selected.. ..everything of your own choice. Let your brother also choose something. That wish you fulfill in your own marriage, okay. Ajay! Ajay! Ajay! Ajay, those people. Run! Run! Catch! Come! Come! Come! Beat us! Hit more! Come on! Stop! Why? No one till now has escaped uninjured from Tiwari's gym. You rascal! You're the one who made the mistake of defying Raja sir. How dare you bellow his respect! When in fact you're not even worthy of looking at him. You'd got this vermillion for your sister. I'll now use this for your funeral. And isn't this marriage dress for your sister? In the open market, I'll snatch it from her body. And I'll mash her fair body. Do you know why we worship him? Because he used all his strength.. ..to protect Sita mother's honour. And you by disrespecting women.. ..call yourself the devotee of Bajrang Bali. You are not a wrestler, but the pet dog of Raja sir. Did you see, Raja sir? How a curse of a poor person.. ..showers like thousands of sticks. What condition they are in today.. ..the way their bones have been broken.. ..tomorrow in a similar manner.. ..your pride will also break down, Ranbir. Their love, like an uproar is colliding with your palace. Your foundations are shaking. Today if the foundations are shaking.. ..then tomorrow the walls will also fall down. You people can't close this uproar in your fists. You can't stop the craziness of their love. You can't stop! You can't stop! "I became crazy, my beloved, in your love." "I have to strike this world, my beloved, in your love." "I became mad, crazy, your beloved, your queen." "Ajay is only mine." "I became crazy, my beloved, in your love." "I have to strike this world, my beloved, in your love." "I became mad, crazy, your beloved, your queen." "Ajay is only mine." "I became crazy, my beloved, in your love." "I have to strike this world, my beloved, in your love." "The tempest of love never stops." "The whole world bows in front of true love." "My life is now the keepsake of your love." "I'll love you forever, be it dawn or dusk." "I have to stoop my heart to your feet.." "..my beloved, in your love." "I have to do so many things, my beloved, in your love." "I became mad, crazy, your beloved, your queen." "Ajay is only mine." "I became crazy, my beloved, in your love." "I have to strike this world, my beloved, in your love." "We have to cross all the limits of the world." "I want to live and die in your arms." "How do I tell you this craziness?" "The magic of your loyalty, my beloved is affecting me." "I have to make the lips meet, my beloved, in your love." "I have to expend everything, my beloved, in your love." "You became mad, crazy, my beloved, my queen." "Ajay is only yours." "I became crazy, my beloved, in your love." "I became crazy, my beloved, in your love." So now it's decided that the girl's uncle.. ..on the happy occasion of his niece's wedding.. ..will give to the boy for the engagement.. ..an amount of Rs. 11,11,111.11/- Then my Rupaiya will be yours.. ..and your Laxmi mine. Now call the girl's mother.. ..and give the boy 111 rupees as a sweet. Sonu! Lajjo! - Sonu! - Lajwanti! - Son Chand. Son Chand, you and here. Yes, I'm fixing my son's marriage with Laxmi. O my God! - What happened? - Yes! No! This marriage can't happen! Now when everything has been decided.. ..then why can't this marriage take place? This marriage can't take place. - But, why, father? Because she's your sister. It means.. - Yes. - Father! Greetings, Raja sir. - Why did you come here? To give the invitation of my daughter's wedding. You've come to give the invitation.. ..or to form a relation with us. You've found such an easy way of.. ..travelling from your hut to this palace. You forgot your status? Poor people don't have status, but only emotions. In the drama of this emotion you've play a good trick.. ..of trapping my innocent niece. I didn't know that poor people are so cunning. This is not an invitation.. but your conspiracy. And this is my answer for it. The stones of this palace has.. ..still not learned to respect invitations. You shouldn't have come to invite such people. Who don't have the manners to talk.. ..with their daughter's mother-in-law. I apologize on his behalf. - No, my dear, no. Actually he wants to give the proof of his bravery.. ..by taking out his anger of defeat on this paper. But unfortunately, this paper can be torn into two pieces. But not my love. Thank you, Raja sir. lf this slap had been a lesson for a lost daughter given.. ..by a kind father, then I would have happily accepted it. But this slap is a challenge to my love.. ..given by an egoistic person blinded by power. And I accept this challenge. Mother, you go home and tell Anjali that.. ..not only will her to be sister-in-law come.. ..but she'll also sing and dance. And if someone can stop, then try to stop me. "By tinkling fickle bangles.

Other arrangements are done? - Yes, sir. The sweet's aroma is good. Ajay brother, Ajay brother, the procession has come. The procession has come! Greetings. My blessings, son. "God, my God, why did you write?" "The separation of a daughter, in my fate." "No one can stop a daughter." "Even if she is secured with chains." "Why the time of separation has to come?"

"You'll have to go, you'll have to go." "You'll have to go, you'll have to go." Small master, where are you all going? I'll ablaze them. I'll destroy that rascal. You don't need to do all this. Your niece has already done all this. By hanging that Ajay. - What do you mean? Police! What is happening? Why are you all going inside? What is happening? Hey, you old man, can't you see? We're searching your house. - But, why inspector sir? Because we've got the information. The things that has come from.. ..your son's in-law's place.. is stolen goods. Stolen! No, inspector sir. What are you saying? My son's in-laws are very decent and respected people. Decency has vanished. As to respect, it doesn't take time to uncover it. Stop, inspector sir. Inspector sir, we'll be insulted in front of the community. That is true. - And everyone is gathered here. Avinash and daughter-in-law has gone.. ..to the temple with their brother. Let them come. They'll be about to come. Are you stopping us from doing our work? I can put you behind the bars for.. ..trying to stop government work. You and your wife both, understood. Father, police is here! What is happening? Dear, policemen are saying that the goods that has come.. ..from daughter-in-law's house includes stolen goods. Inspector, sir. You are mistaken. Stop this search. Who are you? - Ajay. Ajay! You look so innocent. You're accumulating wealth as an innocent person. There is no robber in this locality who.. ..hasn't been beaten by Tipar Singh. How did you escape? - What are you saying? Look, inspector, sir. You've got some wrong information. There are no stolen goods here. You stop this search. This is my sister's in-laws' house. It's a shameful thing for us. I'll come to the police station with you. You stop this drama! And go and stand over there! Leave it, son. It's futile to argue. Inspector sir, you continue your work. That is what I'm doing. If this person lets me do it. Go! Did you find anything? Sir, we didn't find anything amongst the big ones. Have you completed your search? Are you satisfied? Father, we're not thieves. No matter how bad a brother is, he'll never insult his sister. Yes, dear. And before we sue you for defamation.. ..go away from here. Who gave you this jewellery? - My brother. Then this necklace too your brother must have given you. No, this necklace Rama sister gave me as a gift. Rama sister has given as a gift. What are you saying, girl? Rama sister gave you a 5 lakhs worth necklace as a gift. Did you all see it? Did your eyeballs pop out? Have medicine of senses. Just think. This necklace King Brjiwas Singh gave to his niece. Will Raja sir's niece give the necklace.. ..to this person's sister just like that. Did you see the decency of civilized people? This necklace is actually stolen. This is a lie. - No, this is the truth. Believe me, father, Rama sister gave me this necklace. Really! This necklace your Rama sister gave you! Maybe she forgot about it. Because your Rama sister has filed.. ..a complaint of robbery in the police station. And she even named the thief in the report. Read it. - Ajay! This is a lie. My brother didn't steal it. He doesn't even know anything about the necklace. Believe me, father. My brother.. Sister's snitch. lf you wanted to throw your sister from the house.. ..then what was the need to steal? You should have sold her to a brothel. Arrest him! Brother! Brother, no! No, brother! Stop! Stop! Brother, stop. Do you know the consequences.. ..of hitting a decent police officer? I'll change the map of your future. Come! Move! Put this thief inside. Avinash's father, I'll not let this unlucky.. ..person stay in this house. This is a lie. You're wrongly accusing Ajay. I'd myself given the necklace to Anjali, uncle. Ajay is innocent. I won't keep quiet. I'll scream and uncover your ruses. Where are you going? Mother, mother. Your testimony in the court can kill this old lady. Or if you listen to us, then the old lady's life will be spared. You're beast, not human being. You're right. You took advantage of our love.. ..and the way you've insulted us, we'll never tolerate it. Till now you've seen our love, Rama. Now you'll see our hatred. Don't be so ruthlessness. Forgive Ajay. Spare Ajay, spare Ajay, spare Ajay We'll spare Ajay. But only when you testify against him in the court. I'm being accused wrongly, judge. I didn't steal. This necklace Rama only had given.. ..to my sister as a wedding gift. This is a conspiracy of my enemies. They must have faked Rama's signature. You call Rama. She'll uncover their lie in a flash. Call Manorama madam. - Manorama madam may come. Manorama madam may come. Manorama madam, is this necklace yours? The accused says that you'd gifted this necklace.. ..to the accuser's sister for her wedding. Is this true? Tell, Manorama madam. Answer me. Why are you silent? I'm asking you. Why don't you answer? Manorama madam, the court wants to know. Tell us. Did you file a report for this necklace? Is this the same report? Are these your signatures? Answer me. Tell the truth to the court. Why don't you say something? What are you thinking, Manorama madam? Answer me. Are these your signature? Yes, these are my signatures. Rama, are you in your right mind? For the first time in my life I'm fully conscious. For the first time I saw the real face of love. And I also saw the dangerous intentions.. ..hidden behind his sweet talks. For the first time I realised that.. ..love could be such a big ruse. Rama, do you know what you're saying? Judge, she's being pressurized. When I didn't care for anyone's pressure.. ..when I'd loved you. Then why would I care for anyone's pressure.. ..now while testifying in the court? My love was my will. I'm giving this testimony also on my own will. Ajay, I didn't expect this from you. That you love my wealth more than me. I'd forgotten that when a poor person like you.. ..loves a rich girl like me, then it's only a drama. To accumulate dowry for your sister's wedding. Betrayer! At last you showed your true nature. Order! Order! Arrest him! You talk about rich and poor! You've played with our lives! I'll kill you, you cheat! Uncle.. what you said.. I did it. I've maligned my image in front of Ajay. He'll never forgive me. I killed my own love. I lost everything that was mine. At least now release mother. Ranbir.. release the old lady. Mother! Mother! Mother! What did you do! Poor Laxmi. May God never give a fate like hers to anyone. Just recently her daughter had got married. And now she has committed suicide. God knows what agony had befallen her. lf it were an agony, she would have endured it. But she had to go through something worst than agony. Son turned out to be a crook. Daughter has a bad name at her in-laws' place. Which mother can endure all this? The one whom she gave birth to, nurtured and raised up.. ..that person only disrepute her and went away. Poor woman must have gone to God hiding her face. Strange! To which scoundrel she gave birth? They say that mother of a crook.. ..hides her face in the black room. After giving birth to such a spoilt brat.. ..how would she had hidden her face. She had to commit suicide. She had no other option. However she was.. she was from our locality only. I'm remorseful that her child didn't let her live. But it's our duty to respect her death. I take the responsibility of her funeral. Lala. - Yes. See to it that there is.. ..no negligence in the arrangement. Understood. - Yes. Stop. Foolish woman! You wanted to curse me. But you forgot that a widow never gives a curse. You only had said that I won't be able.. ..to stop the flow of Love of those two. I not only stopped it, but also mixed such a poison.. ..that if one cries the tear of blood.. ..then from the other's eyes fire of hatred will flow. Sign on this paper. What are you staring at? I'm not taking away your inheritance from you. This is the government paper for your mother's funeral. In which your signature is required. We can't count on you. Tomorrow you might say that your mother didn't.. ..commit suicide, but someone had murdered her. And you might falsely accuse the police.. ..for not carrying out the investigations. Your sister is very intelligent. She has signed. Now you too sign on it. Come on, do it. lf some other criminal had been in your place.. ..then I would have permitted him to attend the final rites. But you.. I won't permit you to go. Because you had beaten Tipar Singh. I'll never let you forget this. Shoot me! - No! No! Brother. Ajay! Ajay! You don't know what these people.. At least hear me out. Shut up! I've paid the price for every lie that you spoke. Your this lie killed my mother.. ..my sister got disowned from her in-laws' house. - No. Your lie ruined my life. Today I won't spare you. Stop, brother, stop. I won't spare you. Leave me. I say stop, stop. You want to kill her. Go ahead. But you have to pay the price of her death.. ..by your sister's death. Anjali, she's the murderer of our mother. Her false testimony ruined our lives. This is what I want to understand. That why did she give a false testimony in the court. Get up. There is some truth hidden in her tears.. ..that she's not able to say. Her tears are just a hoodwink. Just like how her love was only hoodwink. Only a woman can understand the value.. ..of another woman's tears, brother. Right now you're blinded by your revenge. But when your eyes will open, on that day.. ..you'll realize the injustice that you've done. Come on, sister-in-law. Come on, come on. Where are you taking her? To the same house where mother.. ..had accepted her as a daughter-in-law. Brother! Brother! Rama is not here. I know. That rascal abducted our Rama. Even after knowing all this, you're silent. Tomorrow when the people will come to know.. ..about this thing, then our reputation will be ruined. We will not even be able to show our face to anybody. Ranbir, I'll never let that moment come. That moment has come. That moment has come. That moment has come. That moment has come. That moment has come. That moment has come, Brijrai. You had said that a widow never gives a curse. Then listen, no woman becomes a widow.. ..on her own free will. Rascal impotent men like you are.. ..responsible for giving her this status. As for my curse. Very soon it is going to be fulfilled in front of you. Ranbir, you have great pride in your power. Try your best. But remember one thing. You will not be able to escape the destruction.. ..of the curse given by a helpless woman. You will not be able to escape. I will not come, uncle. Leave me. Burn this hut into ashes. Come on. Stop! You can't take away the respect of this house. You will stop us? - Yes. Do you know the consequences of stopping us? Yes, death. I accept it. But as long as I'm alive, you can't take them from here. Why, you scoundrel! You try to stop Raja sir's path! No! No! No! Junior master, junior master, stop them. Junior master, stop them. No! He stops my path! Dog! Senior master, I've always been faithful to you. My son is naive. Stop them, stop them. No, Lala. When the smell of rebellion comes from my own blood.. ..then I never forgive that person. No, no. And your blood did the same thing. Thrash this rascal so much, so much.. that his last scream.. ..reverberates on every wall of this city. So that after this day no one dares to rebel against me. No! No! No, Raja sir, no! No! No! No! Raja sir! Raja sir! No, father, no. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. No, my son, no. You must be delighted. I've washed your sins with my blood. No, my son, no. Your father won't be able to live with this burden, son. As it is, there are many burdens of sins in my life. I won't be able to endure this burden, son. I won't be able to endure it. Father. - Yes, my son. Do you really want to atone for your sins? - Yes. Then go. Go and tell the truth to Ajay. Tell him that Rama is innocent. Raja sir's men took her away. You'll tell him, father, won't you? Yes, yes, my son. Today you've opened my eyes. I'll never spare those sinners. I'll unmask them in front of the world. Son, forgive me, my son. It's good that they abducted her. She's my mother's murderer. No. She's not your mother's murderer. She even lied in the court to save Laxmi sister. And the truth is, Ajay.. ..that your mother didn't commit suicide. She was murdered. Murdered. 'Go. I free you.' 'No!' 'The voice that raises against us.. ..gets suffocated in this manner# 'Call your son. Call him# 'Ajay!' Rama is not the murderer, Ajay. Save her, Ajay. Ajay, save her. He'll come. Today he'll himself walk and come to the den of death. No, uncle. Greeting, Raja sir. You all wait here only. Raja sir, your Lala turned out to be disloyal. He went and told Ajay that his mother was murdered. His mother didn't commit suicide. After hearing this news, Ajay has become a wounded lion. Now he'll straight away come.. Tipal Singh, there is so much gunpowder.. ..spread on all the sides of this palace.. ..that he won't be able to go away alive from here. No, uncle. I'll make Ajay understand. I'll stop him. I'll handle him. No! Only his death will stop Ajay, understood! - No! Take her away from here. Don't kill Ajay! Don't kill Ajay! Leave me, uncle! Leave me! No! Leave me! There is only one name written on every gun.. ..carried in this palace. Ajay! Ajay! Ajay! Ajay! Ajay! - Kill him! You take her from here. - Yes, Ajay. Ajay, you. - Go. - Ajay. Drive fast, fast. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
