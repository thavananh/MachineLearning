Why don't you guys move along now, play someplace else, huh? Well, it's a free street and I always play where I want to. Oh, charge it. Your credit's no good here. -Oh, it isn't, huh? -No. Well, I'll remember that when I take over this corner and you're paying me for the privilege of working here. Oh, here comes your friend. I'll see you around. Having any trouble with 'em, Jimmy? Nothing I can't handle. Why don't you smack him? That's the easy way. Hey, here comes the truck, fellas. Hurry at it, Jim. OK, Al. Come on. Give me 40. -Please. Come on. Come on, Jimmy. Give me 40. -OK, here you go. Come on. Can I have 50, Jim? I need a lot. Buy today's paper! 50. Gimme 50, too, huh? 50 here. I'll take 50. OK. OK, take care of the rest of 'em, will you, Gimp? -Where you going? -To school. You know that. Now watch the stand till I come back. [clattering] Oh, Jimmy. I have your room all nice and warm for you. Nice and warm in here, isn't it? Yeah. Thanks, Pop. Did you get the apple I brought you? Here's your racing form. Oh, that's thoughtful of you, James. That'll give me something to read. If you're not going anywhere tonight, I have a couple of passes to the picture. So if you and Gimpy want to go. I'd like to, Pop, but I got to go to night school tonight. We're having a mock trial and I'm defending a fella for murder. You know, practicing courtroom strategy. Fine. Fine. You know, that's what I like about you, James. Your perseverance. I was telling that same thing to Tim Farley this morning. You know, Tim and your father and me came from the same county. I said to Tim, I says, who's going to stop him? And you know why? Because he sticks to business. Oh, thanks, Pop. I-- I try. And, uh, speaking about the business, I, uh, I have an opportunity to make a small investment that'll pay us back big returns. What's the horse's name? Baby Jean, in the fort tomorrow at New Orleans. 30 to 1 or more. Not interested. But I had the tip, you might say, right from the horse's mouth. You can't believe a horse, Pop. You ought to know that by now. Well, could you lend me the loan of $1? No. That's what I thought. Want your apple back? James, you're always clowning. JIMMY KEENAN: See you later, Pop. O'Toole, you're losing your power of persuasion. Come on. [interposing voices] Here's another nickel, huh? Here's another nickel. [interposing voices] Oh, hello. Want to join? Come on. Let's get in. No, no, no, no. Jimmy's in school. It ain't right. Oh, come on. No, no. It ain't right. You better run along and study your Sunday school papers. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. Yeah. Run along and tell the boss. All right, boys. Paid me. You ever played it? Seven. There it is. Gee. What are you guys doing here? Why aren't you on the corner selling papers? Go dry up. Who's talking to you? What's the matter? You boys lost your nerve? Come on. Come on. -Hey, lend me a dime, will you? I'll roll my own dough. No, not you. You might get spanked. I'll worry about that. Roll 'em out. Hey, what do you think I'm rolling these for, exercise? I want to see those dice. Now next time you want to see 'em, put down some money. Or else get out and let us make dough. All right. Here's $0.15. Come on, boys. Who's going to play it? I'm a sucker to do this. Oh, you're a sucker, huh? All right. Nine. 90 days. You ought to get life. [chatter] All right here, kids. On your feet. I've warned you before. I thought Jimmy told you to keep out of dice games. Well-- [audio out] --country. It's not afraid of the likes of you, Spike. And if you open your traps, the back to my hand to you. Come on, now. Get moving, all of you. Where are you taking us? I'm taking you down before the judge. And it wouldn't surprise me if he sent you all to reform school. Oh, hello, Burke. How are you? How's things going? What's-- what's going on, huh? I'm taking these kids in for playing dice. Huh? Oh, you are? Well, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves, all of you, every one of you-- -Just a minute. Just a minute. Now you keep out of this, Pop. Well, you're not going to arrest Gimpy, are you? I certainly am. Well, it's in-constitutional. You can't do it. Now you get moving or I'll take you along, too. Come on, now. Get going, all of you. Go on. Go on. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Come on. Mr. Simpson, you elect as prosecutor. The proposition is this. The defendant is charged with murder. The witness is prepared to testify that the defendant is known to her to be dangerous, a possible murderer. I want you to venture speeches as you go along to show me how you can think under pressure before a jury. Very well, Mr. Simpson. Proceed. Ms. Scott. It is your testimony that this defendant is known to you personally to be a dangerous person. Answer yes or now. I repeat, an unequivocal answer, yes or no. Yes. You know this defendant to have definite homicidal tendency? Yes. Your witness, Mr. Keenan. Thank you, Mr. Simpson. Am I to understand you're willing to swear you know my client to be a dangerous person? You know the man who is here on trial for his life to be a potential murderer? I certainly do. You know beyond any question? I do. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you, do we really know anything except from our own past personal experience? The witness says she knows my client is a dangerous man. The witness says she knows my client has always been a murderer at heart. How does she know? How can she know? How do you know my client has always been a murderer at heart? Did he ever murder you? No. Of course not. We say we know wind will blow out a candle. How do we know? From past experience. We saw we know we all must die. Do we know? We haven't died yet. Just a moment, Mr. Keenan. Your speech sounds faintly familiar. Well, I-- I guess it does, sir. Whose is it? Well, I-- I read it in a book. I'll tell you something, though. The man who made that speech got an acquittal on the first ballot. Is that so? Who was he? A man named Abraham Lincoln. I thought so. This is incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial. And when are you going to stop quoting Abraham Lincoln? I'd say Mr. Keenan could hardly pick a better person to quote. There were many better lawyers than Abraham Lincoln, but there never was a man who could argue more successfully to a jury. Keep it up, Mr. Keenan. Psst. Excuse me, Mr. Wilson. What are you busting in here for? I had to. Burke's got all the kids in jail. Wait a minute. I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson. That's all right, Jimmy. Could I be excused now? Of course. Thank you. -It's a terrible thing, Jimmy. -I know. Wait till we get outside. Wait till we get outside. What's it all about? Officer Burke caught them shooting dice with that low-down Spike Morgan running the game. Spike? No less. And then Burke took them all to jail. Was Gimpy in the game? Sure. What are you going to do? I don't know. Nix, not in the courtroom. What's the matter? Are you a cop, too? All right, you boys stand up. On your feet. Take off your hat. What's your name? Gimpy. Gimpy? Well, what's your real name? William McKinley Smith. William McKinley Smith. Well, that's a pretty fine name for a gambler. Your name's Morgan, isn't it? That's right. JUDGE CARROLL: I thought so. You've been here before. Yeah. Advice doesn't seem to do you much good. Do you boys know what I've got to do to you? Officer Burke here has warned you repeatedly, especially you, Spike. Officer Burke didn't want to bring you into the court. And I don't want to have to punish you. But I've got to teach you a lesson before it's too late. As for you, Spike, a few years in reform school might do you some good. Can I say something? Who are you? My name's Keenan. James Michael Keenan. Officer Burke knows me. Yeah, I know. He runs the news stand. Some of these kids work for him. Well, what is it? Well, according to the Constitution, a defendant has the right to select his own counsel, doesn't he? Does he, Mr. Keenan? Yes, sir. Well, how about it? Am I your lawyer? Come on, come on. All right. I understand the charge is gambling. That's right. It says in the statute books that to convict for gambling, you must have witnesses. How much did you lose? Or did you win? Huh? There we are, Judge. No wins, no losses, no gambling. Now, I've had enough of this. Judge, if an officer strikes a counselor during a case, that's contempt of court, isn't it? You seem very well versed in the law, Mr. Keenan. I-- I'm studying it. Yes, I suspected that. Well, what will happen if I let your clients go home? Well, they won't be back here again, sir. You seem very sure of that. Well, if they want to keep on working for me, they've got to stay out of trouble. Very well. I'll play you all on probation to Mr. Keenan. That's all. Thank you very much, Judge. All right. On your way. On your way. Burke. Tell me about that boy. You heard of Tap Keenan? The racketeer? The big shot. That's his brother. Well, he doesn't act like a racketeer's brother. No, certainly never did. Who's the little crippled boy? He lives with Jimmy, works for him. Jimmy's taken care of him ever since the poor little fella's mother died. That's two years back. No parents, hey? Well, he ought to be in an orphan asylum. If you ask me, you honor, little Gimpy couldn't have a better home or finer care than he's got right where he is. Quite a lad, this Keenan boy. They call him the Abe Lincoln of 9th Avenue. Why? He's trying to pattern his life after Lincoln. But he's not growing up with a chance Abe Lincoln had. All right. Come on, come on. I don't owe you a dime. How much did he take off you with those crooked dice? $1.12. Yeah. And when we got pinched, he grabbed up all the coin in the game. All right. You're going to hand it over, or am I going to tell my friend the judge I can't be responsible for you? Yeah. All right. Don't do it again. You're not telling me. I'm telling you don't get any of my kids in the game again. I'd like to have a talk with that boy. See if you can find him. Yes, your honor. You better get that stand of yours cleaned up too, Mr. Keenan. For what? Because any day now, I'm taking over the corner. Well, why don't you try tonight? Well, I'm, uh, waiting till your big brother gets what's coming to him. Then you can't yell to him for help. I don't need any help from my big brother, and you don't-- OFFICER BURKE: Oh, Jimmy. Judge Carroll wants to see you. What's he want to see me for? He's your friend, ain't he? Get going, Spike. Yeah. You fellas better go on back to the stand. Gimp, wait here for me with Pop, will you? This way. Judge, I apologize for interrupting your proceedings the way I did a moment ago. I hope I wasn't in contempt. No. That's all right. Your apology's accepted. Where are you studying law? 10th Avenue night school. Who's your teacher? Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson? Oh, I know Mr. Wilson. Good man. I think I'll have to call him up about you, if only to suggest that he give you some special tips on courtroom etiquette. Now, for instance, when you interrupt the judge, try saying, uh, "if your honor please." It flatters him. Sometimes helps your case. I see what you mean, your honor. JUDGE CARROLL: Come up here a minute. Things look a little different from here, don't they? Yes, sir. You've got quite a problem assuming responsibility for all those boys. Well, I'm used to problems, sir. I'll-- I'll guarantee the behavior of my boys. How about the Morgan boy? Well, he-- he doesn't see things the way you and I do, judge. He hasn't had our advantages. Well, there's something to that. Isn't he sort of a-- of an enemy of yours? Well, I never let myself think I have any. Your ideal had many enemies. Yes. But malice towards none. Here's a book might interest you. "The Humorous Side of Lincoln." I've never read that. It was that side of him that made him so human and just. I can understand that. Pretty hard to have a sense of humor when the going's tough. It's true. How's your paper business going? Pretty good. Will you be able to go to college? Well, I hope to have enough saved up, yes sir. Doesn't your brother aid you financially? No. He has plenty. I can't use that kind of money, sir. You know, Jimmy, it takes a long time for a young lawyer to make a decent living. He did all right. That's right. Well, counselor. Come in and see me again some time. Thank you, your honor. Goodbye. Bye. Gee. He's been with the judge for a long time. Yes. They're taking-- say, that's the hunch. The Judge in the fort tomorrow. Huh? You know what'll happen when you leave the stand again, don't you? I'll get a new boy, that's all. That's right. If it hadn't been for me hurrying to your rescue, you'd be in jail right now. You know that. -OK, Pop. All right. Well, I'm just looking after your interest, James. Thank you very much. -You couldn't-- uh-- uh-- -No. That's what I thought. Oh. I'll never shoot dice again as long as I live. Never. No? No, sir. We're friends again? OK. I'll forgive you this time. Spike, huh? Who else? And after what you did for him with the judge. What are we going to do about it? What are we going to do about it? You guys are going to clean it up, that's what. If you hadn't have been shooting dice, this wouldn't have happened. Come on. All right. Clean it up. We ought to be dragging Spike over here and making him do this. -Yeah. Even if he had-- He's paroled to Jim. He ought to tell the judge about it. Nah, Jim don't need to be no squealer. He can lick the floor with guys like Spike. PAPER BOY: But he don't like fighting. He wants everything according to law. [truck engine] [thud] There's an extra you can sell, Keenan. Do you want any more? Yeah. Give me another 100. OK, Al. Gee, Jimmy's brother in a jam again. Listen to this. "Again, as often in the past, police will question Tap Keenan, but nobody seriously expects he will be held very long." PAPER BOY: They'll never get him. PAPER BOY: Oh, he gets away with it every time. I wonder if he did the shooting. Nah. He probably hired somebody. Yeah. You guys going to talk or sell papers? Here. -Let's get going. -Give me some. -Oh boy. What will you sell? 30. PAPER BOY: Extra paper! PAPER BOY: Extra, read all about it! Keenan, don't go after Spike till we get back, huh? Yeah. Maybe we ought to take guns too, huh? Extra. Extra. Don't let it get you. PAPER BOY: Read all about it. What a pity. Ain't got such a bad face. PAPER BOY: Big highway battle here. Big highway battle. Read all about it. No charge. PAPER BOY: We've got one big highway battle here. Is that any way to sell papers? No. Extra paper! Extry! Tap Keenan in highway brawl! RECEPTIONIST: General Investments, Incorporated. No, I'm sorry. Mr. Keenan isn't in. General Investments, Incorporated. I'm sorry. I can't call Mr. Keenan. Could I see Mr. Keenan? Doris? I'd like to see Mr. Keenan. I'm sorry. Mr. Keenan isn't seeing anyone today. Well, tell him it's his brother. Mr. Keenan. There's a boy here who says he's your brother. He says you can go right in. General Investments, Incorporated. That's how much I want from that guy, and don't come back without it. Scram. What do you know? It's been so long since I saw you, I wouldn't know you. I know you. Sure. I'm always in the paper. See my picture in the extras? Not very good. I'll have to have some new ones made. Smoke? No. Good thing you don't. What, a kid like you, smoking would know your ears down. Come on. Sit down. How do you like the office? It's all right. I had a big year. Pretty soon, I'm going to own the whole building. I got a system, kid. The more I get, the more I want. And the more I want, the more I get. That's the secret of my success. I want you to re-- [audio out] Yeah. Yeah, I'll remember. TAP KEENAN: What are you doing? I own a news stand. Hm. So I make the news and you sell it, huh? At last, we're in business together. That's the way it should be. Where do you live? I got a nice room in the basement in the old house we used to live in. In the basement? I have neglected you. Well, now that I'm in the money, what would you like to be? I'm going to be a lawyer. That's great. Smart. You know what I pay my mouthpiece? $25,000 a year. I'll tell you what. I'll put you through college, give you $50 a week, car. You can come and live with me. And then when you graduate, you'll work for me. That's the set up. Come on. What do you say? I'll take you out and buy you some clothes and doll you all up. Can't have a brother of mine going around looking like that, selling papers and living in a basement. Oh, I'm doing all right. All right? Come on. Come on. I'll show you my place. Wait till you see where I live. I-- I can't write, Tap. Why not? Well, you wouldn't remember what day it is. According to the paper, it's still Friday. So what? So it's mother's birthday. I always take her some flowers. That's right. I'll go with you. Get a big bunch of flowers. Oh, I don't care. $50, $100. Is that all right? Red rose stems. No, I-- I got 'em. Some violets. She always liked them, remember? In there? Yeah. Never mind. You're a funny kid. OK, let's go. [music playing] --else to you, huh? Nothing else. What else? Silly me. I thought bringing you down here might help you remember what you promised Mother. Sure, I remember. I promised her I'd look after you, didn't I? Well, I'm going to, just like-- --in the mountains or something? So that's it. You don't think I-- The argument's over. I get tired of having somebody always fighting my battles. If I was a little bigger-- If you were bigger, you'd be dumber. Be fighting every minute and not saving up any brains. Yeah, I know. Honesty's the best policy. --else to you, huh? Nothing else. What else? Silly me. I thought bringing you down here might help you remember what you promised Mother. Sure, I remember. I promised her I'd look after you, didn't I? Well, I'm going to, just like-- --in the mountains or something? So that's it. You don't think I-- The argument's over. I get tired of having somebody always fighting my battles. If I was a little bigger-- If you were bigger, you'd be dumber. Be fighting every minute and not saving up any brains. Yeah, I know. Honesty's the best policy. Keep out of trouble. Don't cheat. Don't gamble. Don't fight. A lot of don'ts and nothing left to do. It's a cinch for you. You've got talent and everything. Yeah. Yeah. It's easy for me. Yeah. But it's tough on a fella like me with different ideas. Now be quite, will you? I got some studying to do. Peace on earth. I can't seem to get that Christmas spirit business. You will. GIMPY SMITH: Well, I'll try. That a boy. GIMPY SMITH: But I'm still glad you socked Spike. "It is important to remember that a lawyer comes to court prepared. But a truthful witness is not prepared. He has thought so much about the facts as he knows them that he is no longer sure what is fact and what is fiction." Too bad you didn't poke the other two guys. "The intelligent lawyer can take advantage of this doubt in the witness's mind ethically and justifiably in his effort to separate truth from imagination. Sudden attack often produces strange results." Sudden attack. Strange results. So! So what? So where were you on the night of November 8? How do I know? Hey. Then how do you know it was a black car? Might have been a green car or a blue or even deep maroon. And how far were you from the corner when it happened? When what happened? You can't get out of it that way. How do you know that was John Doe in the back seat? You don't know. And yet you dare to perjure yourself. You come here with a well learned story, more fiction than fact. You dare to saw you saw the shot fired. I never saw nothing. Yes, you did. You saw the girl in red. Otherwise your whole story's a lie. You weren't on the corner at all. And if you weren't, where were you? Well, can't you remember, only eight months ago, 7:14 PM the night of the murder? What kind of a witness are you? Answer me yes or no once and for all and stop squirming. And remember the penalty for perjury. You swear upon your oath that there was no other weapon in your overcoat pocket except the shotgun? Do you or do you not? Do you feel all right? Huh? Maybe you got a fever, huh What? You been acting awful funny. Here's your stick. Sh. What's the matter? Something's wrong with him. You better call the doctor. A doctor? Oh, give him some coffee. That'll fix him all right. Your honor, I charge this witness with falsifying the facts, and I demand that he be counted for perjury to the full extent of the law! Now look what you did! -I did? -Did you do that? Yes! You let the coffee pot run over. You ought to get 30 days for perjury-- for-- for-- for-- All right, I'm crazy too! Take me away! -Hello, Pops. -Hello. How are you? You looking for nice Christmas tree? Yes. I'm looking for a [audio out] but you don't seem to have much here. What is it? For big party, small party, or just the family? It's a grand party. It's going to be a big-- I'm going to have popcorn strung all over. I'm going to have apples and oranges hanging down and decorations all over it. Well, how about this one here? How much is that? For you, my friend, I give it to you for $1. Well, how much is this $0.50 one here? Oh, half a dollar. No, I'd like something in between the two. Something for about $0.75, I think. I've got just the one for you. Look. This one here-- [audio out] --oven and she cook by himself. And when you start taste it, it's going to taste just like wild turkey. -Wild turkey? -Yes. Wild turkey. Wild turkey. And this tree. Nice leaves and everything. Wild turkey. Wild turkey. Can of fig. Well-- -Wild turkey. -Let me see. -Wild turkey. Wild turkey. Wild turkey. What are you doing that for? Because it's closing time. We're through for tonight. We never closed this early before. Well, this is Christmas Eve. It's different. What's wrong with you? Not a thing in the world. Come on. We're going home. Why? Will you stop asking so many questions? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Jimmy. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas boys. People will think that-- Maybe I am. [bell ringing] Thank you, Jimmy. The same fella. You're doing it twice. So what? Just in case I'm wrong. Good thing Christmas only comes once a year. Why? You'd have us broke. We ain't going to work, let's go look in windows. No. We got something better than that. I got a surprise for you. What's a surprise? Now, you wait and see till you get inside. [christmas music playing] Can't you tell me now? No, no. Close your eyes. How can I see with my eyes closed? Close your eyes. Ready? One, two, three. Open your eyes. Well? Wait for me. Right back. [knocking] Hey, Pop. Oh dear. Where's the tree? Well, you see, Jimmy, I-- Didn't get it. What happened to the $3? Well, I went in the store to get the tree and I was looking at the tree when right staring me in the face was a great big turkey. And it was marked $3. And I-- I thought, well, now, the other day, I saw a horse named Wild Turkey in the form sheet. And I said to meself, I'll-- I'll put the $3 on Wild Turkey and we'll have a bigger Christmas than you thought of having, you see. -OK. OK, Pop. You see, I got the turkey and the tree-- OK. OK. But you spoiled a little kid's Christmas. Well, where's the surprise? Look, Gimp, I was going to get a tree and then I thought, well, it's kind of childish, you know. We're grown up. What happened? Well, I gave Pop a couple of bucks to get a tree and he-- he lost it. Lost it? He spent it. I'll get it back. Sit down. Forget about it. It's too late now. You give and you receive, huh? You get Spike out of jail and he wrecks your stand. Do a good deed and you get it back double. You give Pop some dough and you never see it again. Now do you still believe in that stuff? Yes. I been looking for you. -Why? -Never mind why. Come on. He didn't do anything. You stay here, Gimp. You got to go to jail, I'm going, too. You keep out of this. What's this all about? No use asking questions. Move along. Move along. Here he is. JUDGE CARROLL: Hello, Jimmy. Hello, your honor. Jimmy, it's my custom every Christmas to have some of the boys in my district up for tree and turkey. Now, if you can get away, how'd you like to come and bring up your boys? All five of 'em? As many as you like. We've got a big turkey. Well-- well-- well, we'd love it! Good. See you tomorrow evening then, eh? -Yes, sir. -All right. Goodnight. -Goodnight. We'll be there! Goodnight. Huh. Now what do you say? If I hadn't got pinched, you'd never have met the judge. Did you ever see a more hard boiled guy? Your bath is ready, my lord. Don't you think it's kind of dangerous, this time of the year? I might catch pneumonia. You might catch something else if you don't get in there and take your bath. And no stalling. Behind the ears, too. Well, here goes. [splashing] Oh! Oh, golly. This is cold. Oh! Oh, golly. This is cold. Four score and seven years ago, our fruthers-- fathers brought forth to this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Oh! [gurgling] [spitting] Oh! [spitting] Oh! This is cold! Uh, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that the government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from this earth. GIMPY SMITH: Oh, golly. I'll get pneumonia sure. [splashing] Oh, golly. Ow, my head. When are we going to get a bigger bath tub? [splashing] Ain't that something. Gee, does a bath make a fella feel good. Sure glad you make me take one. Oh, you're glad, huh? Oh, hey, fella. How about something else. Did you forget? Get your mind clean now, too. Don't forget any-- --and please don't let Jimmy find out I didn't take a bath. Well, that's that. Yeah, that's that. Don't you trust me? I took a bath. No, I don't. --talk this over. No way. You tried and put one over on me, huh? Oh. Oh, I was only fooling. Yeah? Well, I'm not. I shouldn't even take you to the party. Maybe I don't want to go. Well, that suits me. It better be a good dinner, the way I'm suffering. Sure. Look at that. Enough dirt behind them ears to grow potatoes. Oh. It's cold. Cold? It's warm. Yeah? Well, feel it. [gurgling] I'll get pneumonia! You'll get pneumonia. You'll get nothing. You'll pay a big doctor bill. Yeah. [gurgling] Close your eyes. Hold still. And remember, first time Judge Carroll say you, he almost put you in jail. So watch your step tomorrow. And as soon as you see him, take off your cap. Why? Don't ask so many questions. And say yes, sir, or no, sir, to him. And whatever they have to eat, you don't want any second helpings. Don't I? No. And you remember, now. Yes, sir. It's going to be a real Christmas. Oh, it's cold! No. Oh. There we are. Now. [bells ringing] Well, here I am. Oh, Uncle. The tree looks grand. Well, I got all the presents. I hope they're all right. Oh, thanks for helping me out, Anne. They'll do, I'm sure. I don't know a thing about your gifts. What did you get them last year? Oh, last year, I had a little trouble. They wanted guns. Guns? Oh, my. I-- I got things like harmonicas and neck ties and fountain pens. Well, after all, they're the sort of things Jimmy's boys ought to appreciate. That is, if he has the influence over them I think he has. Well, let's go over the list. I have some tags. -The list? Well, where is the list? Oh, here. I've got it here. Now let's see. There's Jimmy, Jiggsy, Beansie, Sammy, and Gimpy. Well, there isn't any lead in the names, is there? I'll have to eeny meeny them. No, you'll make out, I'm sure. Uncle Joe. Are you sure these boys won't resent my being here? Well, why should anyone resent it? Especially these boys who probably never met anyone like you before. No, I only meant that-- well, maybe I'll hold them down. Well, I hope you do. Oh, Anne. These boys are all right. They're perfectly normal. They have a bad environment. No fit homes. Gloomy surroundings. You know, they need to meet somebody like you. Somebody to look up to. You'll have a wonderful influence on them. But this Keenan boy. How did he overcome his background? Well, that's very unusual. Instead of climbing a ladder to a second story window, he's climbing one to an ideal. He seems to have faith in himself and faith in everybody. Why, he even said a good word for an incorrigible who I caught. So that's what you see in him. A reflection of yourself. Oh, no. No comparison. Why, I had everything and more. And here's a boy with practically nothing who goes out of his way to help people. Why, he's even taking care of a little cripple. Gimpy. Yes, Gimpy. Oh, everything-- everything I could wish for. With his [inaudible] with a shingle and a piece of charcoal, studying law, asking no favors from anybody. Say, by the way, you mustn't make him think we're doing him a favor today. I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll make believe we're giving this party for the little fellow. We'll make him the guest of honor. You know, I think I'm giving this party for myself. I'll have more fun of it than they do. But not anymore than I will. Thanks for letting me be here, Uncle Joe. Oh, you are half the party. Now let's see. Oh, dear. Jimsy. Jiggsy. Beansie. Oh, I've got to write all these things out here. [doorbell] Bet nobody's home. Well, there better be. I kept from eating all [audio out]. Gee, look at the table. [interposing voices] -Come on. Come on, you guys. Now look out. Merry Christmas. Hi. Merry Christmas to you. Come on in, boys. Any more out there? -No. That's all. -All right. Come on in. Merry Christmas, boys. Merry Christmas, Jimmy. -Come on. Let's get 'em off. I think we've all met before. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Gimpy! Come on in, everybody. That's the way. Hey, it's a nice place you got here. Yes. Yeah. [giggling] [piano music] Gee, look at this. [muttering] Oh, can you pull this tooth out here? Oh, sure. Of course. -Right there. -Which one, huh? Yeah, that one. Oh. -All right. You get it? Yeah. Gee. It's the kind that grows out of the ground. Say. I had it sent down from my farm in Maine. Hear that, Jimmy? It's from the woods. Sure, it's from the woods. -Got a big place down there? -Yeah, oh, yes. We got a lot of those trees on it. Oh, Jimmy. I want you to meet my niece, Ms. Carroll. Anne, this is Mr. Keenan. Yes, I know. I've heard all about the promising young attorney. You have? I'm Jiggsy, how are you? [interposing voices] Merry Christmas. Oh. So this is Gimpy. Merry Christmas, Gimpy. Merry Christmas. Here it is, Judge. You want to take a look at this bird while it's still in one piece? Boy. Look at what. Boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy. It's as big as a house. JIGGSY: Look at the size of it, would you? BEANSIE: Gee. Look at the size of the thing. Oh, boy. The people versus T. Gobbler. Are we ready for trial? People are ready, your honor. And the defense? Oh, the defense is ready, your honor. Let's go to trial. [laughter] Boy, look at the radishes! Oh, boy. Come on. The court will be seated. Ms. District Attorney, what do you intend to prove? I intend to prove, your honor, that Mr. T. Gobble is guilty of hording grain, living on the fat of the land, and thereby producing a distressing state of hunger among the people. He sure is! He about 25 pounds guilty. He been hording chestnuts and oysters. It is the judgement of this court that the estate of Mr. T. Gobbler be divided into equal portions to satisfy the appetites of the people. [cheers and applause] Now, who's going to get a leg? I think Gimpy would rather have white meat. Yes, he would. [laughter] Don't you want some celery or olives first? Don't you want any salad? You sure paid your debt to society. Well, now, boys, if you can stagger in after that dinner, I have a little business to transact here. I tell you I did it, judge. I mean, your honor, that's the first time I've had pie and pudding at the same meal. Pie and pudding, eh? Oh. All right. Now, wait. Oh, Anne. Come here a minute, will you? You've got to help me with this because I can't handle all these packages and everything. We were short one, so I had to take one of your neck ties. Now, let's see here. Here's the first package. Wait till we find out who this is for. This is for Mr. Jimmy. Oh! Hey, Jimmy! Hey! JIGGSY: Hey, what did you get? Now, now, now, wait a minute. Order in the court, or I'll have you all up for contempt. That right, judge? That's right. Jiggsy. Who's Jiggsy? -That's me. That's me. That's me. For me. Thanks. Jiggsy. Who's that for? Flatfoot. Oh! Let's see. Oh, here. That's for Sammy. -Here's one. -Oh, Sammy. For you. Thank you. And I guess that's all, isn't it? Oh, wait a minute. Here's another one. William McKinley Smith. Is there anyone in the house named Smith? Oh, that's me! Another one. William Smith. Here's another one. Hey! Whoa! Oh, boy. JUDGE CARROLL: McKinley Smith. And here's one, Smith. [chatter] [chatter] All right now, boys. Now open them up. Come on. [chatter] Hey. Look at this. Nice. James Michael Keenan, counselor at law. Oh, your honor. Oh, thank you so much. I-- from you? Oh, well, thanks. Thanks an awful lot. I'll have to become a great lawyer now, just so I can carry it. Well, I'm sure it won't be long. But you haven't looked inside. Go on. Open it. "The Humorous Side of Lincoln." Oh, your honor. I-- I don't know. JIGGSY: Speech! BEANSIE: Speech! JIGGSY: Come on! GIMPY SMITH: Speech! JIGGSY: Come on.
