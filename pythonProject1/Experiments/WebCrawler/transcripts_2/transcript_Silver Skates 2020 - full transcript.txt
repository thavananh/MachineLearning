foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- NETFLIX PRESENTS Four "Peter's Boats" with sterlet and sturgeon! Six "Bronze Horsemen" with game! Our game pies seem quite popular! There's a special deal, two for the price of one. Like at the pharmacy. You are all thumbs. Where are the bells? - I forgot. - Next time you'll lose your job. Into the oven! Let's give you that golden crust, darling. That's a fine pie! To the shop! Le Grand Pirogue delivery. Hello! Yes, delivery for noon. 32, Mokhovaya Street. Terentiev? Has he ordered for Christmas yet? Yes, 50 pies. Hmm… Who's the fastest of you lot? Come here. 32, Mokhovaya street, 20 minutes. Excuse me! Hi, buddy. Move it! You lazy horse. Excuse me! Tobacco! Come and buy! Don't be shy! Hey! Please make way! I am in a hurry. Hey! - What happened? - The street's closed again. …make your hair stand on end! Huh? You wretch! Where are you going? Get him. There! Stop right there! Look at him! Get up! - Remain calm! - I am calm! - And don't complain! - Smart, are you? Above the law? What law would that be? Everyone knows. They told us to wait, we're waiting! That must be them. Oh! Stop! Whoa, wait. We are turning back. Alice! Alice! Attention, please. When should the dinner party invitations be sent out? - Not earlier than ten. - Mm-hmm. But not later than seven days before the scheduled event. Good. How should the hostess comport herself before the house guests find their seats at the table? - If the number of guests is not too large? - Mm-hmm. Freely walk around the living room speaking to her guests. Correct. We shall continue this after lunch, with the rules for seating the guests at the table. So exciting! "So exciting!" Good afternoon, Nikolay Nikolayevich! Dinner is served! Fyodor. Darling! Miss Jackson! Alisa! Be seated. We received an invitation to the grand duke's New Year's Eve ball. It will be à la russe. Traditional Russian style. Is patriotism back in fashion? It is! I have talked to the Mariinsky Theatre's costume artist. He'll make our costumes. We'll be the talk of the night. "To mark the turn of the century, gas lamps of the Eiffel Tower will be replaced with electric lights." The French still hope to bring back the lost grandeur. But I'm sure they won't see any of that in the 20th century. Mark my words! At least women have access to higher education in France. Are you still on about that? How many times do I have to tell you? They only produce free-thinkers and rebels. A respectable lady has nothing to do with it. Excuse me, Miss Jackson, what do you think about so-called women's rights? In my opinion, I believe everybody should mind their own business. Women have one role in the world, men another. Thank you very much indeed. See, Alisa? That's an opinion of an educated European woman. Let's close this topic once and for all. What about Queen Victoria? What does she have to do with this? Something has just touched me under the table. Perhaps it was a spirit? What is it? Or the astral body. I told you not to bring that animal into the dining room! Happy now? Can I go play cards? You can keep this. Thank you! Now get out. Hand over the box first. I don't get it. Your outrageous tardiness was so embarrassing for Terentiev that he cancelled his order at once. The road was blocked! They didn't let anyone through! I'll make it up to you. I know your type. Go easy on you once, and you behave like swine. I am not a swine! I demand full pay for the past month! Well, if you demand, you will get it. - Get out! - What are you doing? - Let me go! - As you wish. It's me. - Do you have it? - Yes. Ma'am, please don't be angry. It started croaking, that's how it all happened! It's a sin, forgive me Lord! I'm not angry. Thank you, Prosha. And this, as you asked. What do you need that froggy for? Some divination? It is Svyatki time. I want to do some too. But for that I need a bigger mirror. Like yours. Can I come in the evening? Who wants this? We haven't sold any! Wait for a bit. Get off! You said that about fish, that we'd get lots of money. Dirty news from Paris! Blast! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let me help you. Oh my. - There's snow all over you. - Yes. Dirty news from Paris… Hey! Wait! You dropped this! Damn! I'll bury you under ice! Hey! Why are you chasing me? Oh… You dropped this. A quick bugger! Who taught you to skate so well? I do this for work. Well, I used to. Le Grand Pirogue. - "We deliver in 30..." - They fired you? When? - Today. - Congratulations! - Why? - You are starting a new life. You need a job then? Yes, badly. Come to the Devil's Bridge at midnight. Do you know where that is? I lost my balance, that's all. It happens to everyone. - It's fine. Good thing you were there. - By pure chance! That's what you think. Nothing happens by chance. It was meant to be. - Dad! - Yes? What if an icicle fell on your head? Also meant to be? It depends. If it falls on a governor, they might start cleaning the roofs for once. Motya! Why the long face? You don't look yourself. I can see that. What happened? Forget it. Let's go. Did they fire you? It's all right, Motya. Don't get upset. You are a smart lad. You'll get a new job in no time! Far better than the old one. God willing, we'll make it through this month. Maybe they'll take you on as a lamplighter? You'll see, one day everything will be electric. - They tell you fairy tales. - Fairy tales? It's the future. Look! Razor-sharp! That's Dutch quality for you. Remember, when you gave them to me, you said they were magic skates? That's what my old man told me. It's a family tradition. In use for years, but none the worse for it. That is pure magic, not some electricity! - Here. - Yes! This one I like. Who's the composer? Claude Debussy. Pity he's not Russian. I noticed that you usually play this when you want to ask me about something. Yes, I did. Niki, nothing can be hidden from you! It's your gift! - Hmm. It's my curse. - Mm. Alisa's insolent behaviour has been getting out of hand lately. Like today. She is openly rude to you. How do you suggest I deal with it? Give her a flogging? Marriage can cool even the most rebellious ones. Darling, I don't mind! But decent candidates don't grow on trees. Hmm. Is there not a single suitable candidate in all of St. Petersburg? Hmm? Hmm? Hm? Lordy! What is this sorcery? This is science. Ah. SCIENCE AND LIFE "Bestuzhev higher education courses for women open for new students." Husband-to-be, come have dinner with me! I am kinda… may I turn off the light? I can't do this with lights on. I'll give you a kerosene lamp. Are you lost, brother? I've been invited… He invited me! He's a friend. Duke! Genghis. I'm Alex. Nice to meet you. I'm Matvey. And this is Fly. - Why Fly? - It's damn hard to catch me. Oh. Husband-to-be, come have dinner with me! Why don't you come, you wretch? You wanna try? The candles are already lit. - I don't believe in this. - How come? That's how my mommy saw my daddy, and my granny, my grandpa. They married the next day! And lived happily for 40 years. How can one not believe in it? I don't believe that out of a billion people one is destined for you. What's a billion? Have you been doing this long? Doing what? Well, stealing. It's not stealing. You can't steal what doesn't belong to them. Who are "they"? Usurpers. Those who live off other people. Merchants, landowners, officers, public servants, nobility. Their name is Legion, for they are many. Everything they allegedly own doesn't belong to them. It's temporarily in their possession. But… is the Emperor also a usurper? Are you an agent of the state? Asking good people such questions! Guys, I just… I was joking. Shall we go for a spin? Nothing's more humiliating than being a slave of a slave. Whose slave is he? Your former master is slave to his capital. - Like all bourgeois. - Burg… what was it again? Bourgeoisie. The ruling class that lives off capitalistic income from hired labour. Alex, you're going to do his head in! What are you staring at? This coat of arms was on the carriage they blocked the road for. A lion with a broom in his mouth? They're loaded! - Is this also bourgeoisie? - No, this is aristocracy. Ah. That calls for a punishment! You're flying too low. Come on, grab his nipple. He won't mind. Be gentle! Come on, hurry. Get painting and make it pretty. A missy! Shh! Please don't scream. That was spectacular! Hurry, let's get out of here. Carry me, Fly. She got you good and proper. That broad has a temper! Guys! I'll go now. My home is that way. All right then. We could use your hands, though they are burned. And your feet. Despite those odd-looking skates. You can find us at the Ice Fair. I'll think about it. It was nice to meet you. See you. Ciao. He won't be back. Too squeaky-clean. - Want to bet? - Yes! Good morning! Did you sleep well? Ooh. You did some fortune telling last night! Your nose always itches after. Hmm? And? Did he come? What was he like? Handsome? Did you like him? Mm… An officer? Mm-mm. With a moustache? A nobleman? No. The opposite. How is that? Tonight's dinner at Shuvalov's will seal my fate. - Mm-hmm. - l am asking for Sonechka's hand. What do you need that Sonechka for? Everyone knows Shuvalov is broke for good. He lost all connections at the court. His career is over. - Gentlemen! - I'm sorry- Take your seats! But those are dirty rumours. They say his daughter is also up for grabs now. The biggest catch of the season. Her mother left the young duchess quite a dowry. Let us begin. What I have here is the latest model of a police truncheon. Since the government announced a course for rapid modernisation, we believe it appropriate to replace some of our sabres with these truncheons. They deliver a good blow and are effective in dispersing protests. Notably, unlike the use of sabres, the use of truncheons does not result in death or serious injuries. There. There. What doesn't kill you, so to speak, makes you wiser. Right, very funny. - Trang… trun… cheon. - Pass that on please. Are you suggesting we import them from England? No, no import. These are made in Russia. There's a factory near Tula that can make up to 10,000 of them a year. Gentlemen, who wants to speak out? Arkady Trubetskoy. Department of public order and safety. Given the current political tensions in our country, this kind of modernisation might be misinterpreted. If potential rebels are not afraid of policemen with sabres anymore, consequences can be unpredictable. I believe that this initiative goes against the current state interests. Aren't you too early in your career to think about state interests? Pardon, Aleksandr Ivanovich, it's merely my opinion. Are you by any chance related to Count Mikhail Trubetskoy? Yes, Your Excellency. He is my father. Ah. I see. This factory near Tula. Yes, Your Illustrious Highness. Does it perchance belong to your father-in-law? Pure coincidence. They offered the best price. Of course. Have a seat. Aleksandr Ivanovich, I think that right now you should be focusing your efforts not on these truncheons, for Christ's sake, but on the rising pickpocketing rates. It is what it is. - It's the holiday season. - What? - Excuse me, Your Excellency. - Yes? The bandits have been reported to use ice skates for their crimes. As far as I know, most take place at the Ice Fair. Yes. The bastards are speedy. Policemen can't always keep up with them. That can be solved. Do you have any ideas? - How much is the sausage? - It's delish! Hey! You won't get it anywhere else. I'll drop by later. - You thought about it? - I did. You've lost the bet. Let's see if you're any good. Sometimes it's enough to pick the right moment, be in the right place at the right time. One moment. It’s there for the taking. That's the best part. Thanks to our skates we're so quick that the bourgeois don't notice us lightening the burden of wealth in their pockets. You're a quick skater, but you also need fast hands. Watch me. Did you see that? Now you try. We'll develop sleight of hand and reaction. You'll train until it becomes natural. Your hands should do all the work. Without you. And this is what we call "road accident." Oh boy! You gotta be more careful. Oh well, could happen to anyone. This is a "top." You spin the gentleman until he loses excess weight. Why a "top"? It sounds nice. Chapter 13. The way to a capitalist's heart is through his purse. After each ex… - What? - Expropriation. You have to drop the haul. For that our partnership has a bank for time deposits. My friend, tea, please. That'd be 15 kopeks. Four out of ten! It has to be ten out of ten. Ten times in a row. What is this? - Um… a coin. - More than that. To procure gold, you need some silver. And this we call "a holey pocket." Most of them don't know where their money goes anyway. Oop! - Motya! - Hmm? What are you getting up to these days? I got a new job. I said you would! What is it? Nothing in particular. A partnership. And what do they do? Expropriation. Interesting. Something modern? Sort of. Well done. I am proud of you. Come on. I can't look at it anymore. Don't look at it. Drink it. Eat the skin at least. Dad! Oh! They're richer than I thought. They also own a lavish estate on Lake Ladoga, vintage vineyards near Nice and a palace in Yalta. Ooh! Soon there'll be a private golf course there. Ah? A what? - They're waiting for us, Mom. - Let's go. Your Nobleness! Thank you. The Trubetskoys! I am delighted to see you. What? - Countess! - Nikolay Nikolayevich! Count. Let me introduce you. My wife Severina. My daughter Alisa. Pleased to meet you. Nikolay Nikolayevich, thank you for the invitation. It's a great honour for me. Your late father and I were mates while serving in the Caucasus. Why haven't you asked for a favour? Hmm. One should be judged by their work, not their relatives. - Like father, like son! - Mother! All right. Countess, it's good to see you again. - Please. - I hope you'll enjoy the performance. Thank you. Gemini. This constellation consists of two bright stars that are very close to one another. Gemini is the first air sign in the zodiac. They tend towards duality. They are constantly chasing something unattainable. Air is their element, Mercury, their planet. Their interests are literature and politics. The most famous Geminis include Peter the Great, Alexander Pushkin… …and my husband. - Bravo! - Thank you, darling. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Gentlemen, I must steal my husband from you. Excuse me. I missed you. Count! How do you like the evening? - Amazing! - Really? I enjoyed the performance immensely. Could it be any other way? - Duke! I'd like to take this opportunity. - Mm-hmm? The Imperial Ice Skating Club is soon having its annual ball. It would be an honour... I'm afraid, skating isn't the sharpest of my skills. I meant your daughter. I think it's a marvellous idea. My husband and I have been talking about arranging more social outings for Alisa. We will consider your proposition and let you know in due time. Thank you! Good morning! Rise and shine, everyone! Time to work! Early bird catches the worm! Good morning! Dad! Let's go to the hospital. Let doctors have a look. Doctors! What do they know! You should heal the soul, not the body. That's where all diseases come from. One more time. Cough again please. Mm-hmm. Get dressed. Will you keep him in the hospital? No, there's no need. Thank God! - Told you, nothing serious. - But he coughs up blood. What can we do if it goes on? Mmm… Drink more milk. It alleviates the symptoms. - Excuse me, others are waiting. - Thank you! It is free of charge. Wait here. There must be treatment for this. - You can't leave him like this. - Too late. He has advanced phthisis. We can't do anything. I just didn't want to upset you. Wait! There's got to be something. Somewhere, I don't know. There must be some treatment. The only place where they can help is Dr. Tyshler's clinic in Baden-Baden. In Germany. Very far away. Very expensive. Unfortunately, you can't afford it, so I didn't suggest it. Would he be able to help? Motya, stop bothering Grigoriy Anatoliyevich! Look how many patients he has! What I have is a simple cold. He is the only one. Let's go. He's asking for it. Your time to shine! - Go for it. - Mm. Not bad for the first time. How much for lease? - You just push the sleigh. - Catch him! And distract them at the right time. Hop on, sir! - What the… It's my turn! - Sir, I am faster! Take me to Nikolskaya Square. I've seen your face! - Easy, young man! - Of course. Who's driving like this? First day or something? - Remember how we got here? - There's nothing here. Not a soul. That's the point. We don't want any neighbours. A ship? Does it have a name? Sure! The Leaky Frigate. If things go this well, by spring we'll have patched up the holes, adjusted the sails, and off we go. Go where? Into the bright future. Welcome aboard. Come on. Move it! Help me sort the loot. That's what I call a good harvest! A batch of fresh holiday cash. Still smells of ink. What's this? I don't know. It was in his pocket, so I took it. Let me see. What is it? It's an invitation to the ball at the Imperial Ice Skating Club. The fattest cats will be there. Two of them! You and I on the razzle! It'll be a goldmine. With a mug like yours they won't let you in with ten of them! - Have you seen yours? - I didn't offer myself. It's easy. Matvey decides whom he'll take. - Me? - Him? He's wet behind the ears! Got lucky once! That sufficed to get us these invitations. So they won't let me in, but they'll let him in? Dressed in those rags? You are right. Not in those rags. And finally, your skates. - What about them? - Let me have a look. Here. Too noticeable. Let the guys rest tonight. - Well... - You don't want to get noticed. Well, doesn't he look aristocratic? A true baron! The more expensive the outfit, the less suspicion aroused among those fine people. Here, clothes definitely make the man. Here's the invitation. I can't help it. Excuse me. There's nothing you can do in Paris in the winter! I'm telling you! Count Bobrinsky and I would have died of boredom if it wasn't for this. - Can't you read? - Welcome, gentlemen. - Your skates, Duchess. Must be your size. - Merci. What a cutie! Bonjour, Mademoiselle. - Do you know him? - No. - …champagne? - Just right! - Do you know them? - I don't. But everyone here pretends they know one another. Just smile. Après vous, Mademoiselle! Thank you. Good evening! - Brut? - Sure. Thank you. - Great. Now we have no champagne. - There is more. Whoa! So slippery! - Where do I get the profiteroles? - Over there, sir. There? Great enterprises are waiting for us! Profiteroles! Aren't these profiteroles delicious? Why aren't you having any? - Get some before they get cold! - Champagne! Pardon me, my bad! - Are you okay? - Yes, he barely touched me. Too forward and too rude. Winking in public is the grossest violation of the etiquette. Yeah. Dear guests! Welcome to Mikhailovsky Palace! Never before has our ball been so grand! We owe this to the generosity of Grand Duke Konstantin Alekseevich! Ah! Bravo! I am happy to welcome you to our humble celebration! I am sure that the 20th century will be even more exciting! Hurrah! And now you'll see a performance by an officer, Count Arkady Trubetskoy! If our honoured guests would kindly vacate the centre of the rink. What a marvellous evening! Which one of them? Think larger, my friend. Pardon me. My skates are a bit too small. In the times of peace, officers have plenty of creative energy. This is so beautiful. - Bravo! - Amazing. Bravo! What a jump! Bravo! Bravo! - Thank you for everything. - Bravo! I am so glad you came! Miss Jackson, Alice. Your act leaves an indelible impression on me. Well, I hope not only on you. Miss Jackson, will you permit me to invite Alice for a waltz? I think that's a wonderful idea. Alice. Alice? Count, I'm not a very confident skater. Just stand still, Alisa, I'll do everything for you. Alisa, may I be frank with you? Yes. All my life I've felt there's something amiss. I've always felt a strange, almost mystical emptiness in my heart. You should discuss this with a doctor, not me. That's witty. ♪ While I'm young, strong and single I cherish the ice-skating thrill ♪ ♪ Winter cold and promenade Keep the doctors away ♪ Ever since I first saw you, I can't imagine my life without you. Count, we've never even talked before. I don't know you at all. I'm sorry to interrupt, but we have a situation that requires your attention. I'll be with you in a moment. It can become very serious. Alisa, you’ll have to excuse me for a moment. I'll accompany you to Miss Jackson. No need, Count. I'll stay here and practice a bit. Of course. No, it's… I always carry my watch in this pocket. Where could they be? It means someone has stolen it. - Count Trubetskoy, at your service. - Here's what happened… - Thank you. - You're welcome. - It's you! - It's me. That was a stupid bet. I didn't mean to frighten you. - A bet? - Mm-hmm. - Your idea of anatomy is quite peculiar. - Uh-huh? I'm talking about your masterpiece on my balcony. Well… that's how I see it. Mm-hmm. You've changed a lot since then! We live in the times of rapid change. I can't find my wallet! It was in my pocket a minute ago. It's not what you think it is. I guess it's time for me to go. Wait. Here's the deal. I won't turn you in, if… - I'll tell the orchestra. - 13, Solyanoy Lane. Tomorrow at 12. But this is blackmail. It is. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a bit of a situation here. If you think you dropped or cannot find something, please come to the rotunda… I've been looking for you! We don't want to be late for our grandma's dinner. Where's my Breguet? If you've seen… Deal? …someone unknown and suspicious, report… Arkady Mikhaylovich! …to Count Trubetskoy. Uh… Why did the orchestra stop playing? I'll take care of this. Gentlemen, what's going on? - Have you seen a white dog? - What? The Countess lost her favourite dog on the rink. - Close the gate, don't let it out! - Quick! - A dog? - Did anyone just leave? Who were you chatting up? No, Your Nobleness! Have you fallen for a member of the enemy class? Don't ever forget who you are and where you come from. This way. - Anna Pavlovna! - Holy cow, we… Grand Duke, you dropped your watch! Tonight, we celebrate. Ah! Oh. Dad, you're still awake? Can you sharpen these for tomorrow? - What are these? - They are for work. What's wrong with yours? Let them have some rest. We're not allowed to use old, I mean antique skates. For safety reasons. Our boss is very strict. Where have you been all night? What are you wearing? Are you drunk? Dad! Look at this instead. That's not all of it. Here's more. Look. Here. Here's more. Here. We need to put it somewhere. Where's our little box? Matvey. Nothing good will ever come of money gained dishonestly. What does it have to do with anything? Honour is for those who can afford it. Matvey, you have to give this money back where it came from. Before it's too late. Promise me. I won't. We need this money. For your treatment. The doctor told me. We must take you to Germany as soon as possible. Son, you… you don't understand. You want to save my body, but I want to save your soul. What if there is no soul? No afterlife. Only this life and then nothing? How can you say this! He hears everything! What if He isn't there either? Go! Faster, faster! Keep up the pace! Posture! Well done. Continue. Beat harder! This is a quick response speed-skating squad. Do I understand correctly that you thought of this long ago? We receive direct orders from the ministry to put all our resources into fighting political crimes. Last night, the grand duke was robbed on the Imperial rink. A priceless family heirloom was stolen, his grandfather's watch. I think I needn't remind you who his grandfather was. I remember very well. I am convinced, Your Excellency, it's the doing of the same gang from the canals. Trying to steal the imperial family's property can be equated to terrorism. When will your squad be ready for duty? We'll start to patrol tomorrow. Excellent. See, Nikolay Nikolayevich, the wooden clubs came in handy after all. Fall in! Did you sleep well? I hope we didn't bother you? I think it's all right. Alex, can I live here for a while? Mm. You can stay for as long as you like. Let's go. Rise and shine, comrades! We've had enough rest! Leave your jacket here. Here's half of the sum. Could you please call that clinic, speak to Tyshler and arrange everything? I'll get the rest. Put this away, it's for Professor Tyshler. I'll telephone him, but you must hurry. Ouch! I'm still alive, you know! Guess I'm really sick. Oh dear, not good. I'll get Prosha to bring you up a cup of hot tea. And, a… ginger cookie. Lend me a ruble! I'm not a bank! Where are you going? Whoa. Whoa! Stop. Wait here. You came! - You didn't turn me in. - Come on. Let's go. - In here? - Yes, hurry up. - What is this place? - Read the sign. COURSES FOR WOMEN But I… - Do you need me to get something? - No. Pretend to be my husband. Mendeleev is going to be there! So. Vyazemskaya! - Is that you? - Yes. It's your turn. You wait here. Come on in. And thus, this formula completes the chemical equation. Hmm. - Well done. - Surprising. Pff. My friends! I'm terribly sorry for being late. - I came straight from the station. - Finally. I wouldn't be distressed if it was my fault. But the train was late! As usual. I can tell you're not angry with me… His usual self. …let's continue! What do we, or rather who do we have here? Mademoiselle, let me introduce myself. Dmitry Ivanovich. - And what is your name? - Alisa. Alisa? Nice to meet you. Well? Dmitry Ivanovich, I didn't expect to meet you. I feel like I know your Foundations of Chemistry by heart. Well, we'll see about that! Allow me. - The beginning is good. - Thank you. Good job! ♪ Girls Tell your friend that I'm… ♪ Listen, this is very bold! Very bold and well done. My dear colleagues, I've seen enough. Let's enrol her. Not so fast, Dmitry Ivanovich. I trust you have permission to study from your father or your husband? Of course. My husband is here. Invite him in. I like how bold you are. - Thank you. - Really bold. Here's her husband. Me, yes… her husband. I agree to everything. See? Won't stop nagging me… my wife. "I want to marry…" I mean study, in the Higher curses. Uh… uh… I mean courses! Courses. See? Even her husband is not adamantly opposed, he's for it. Yes! Dear colleagues, let's enrol her! Not so fast, Dmitry Ivanovich. Have you written a permission yet? Um… - No. - How is that? Write it now then. Please give him a sheet of paper. Go on. Go on, young man. What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? Don't be shy. Over here. Well? In your own words. Please. Do us an honour. Ah-ha… Where was your wedding? At which church? - Ah. Vladimirskaya. - Saint Andrew's. Mm-hmm. Next, please. Why don't you talk to your father? What a splendid idea! How did I not think of that. You are welcome. It's sarcasm, ever heard of that? You don't know him. His views on what a respectable young lady should learn are slightly different. I don't get it. If you'd passed and enrolled, then what? He'd find out anyway. I was ready to leave home. Everything depended on this exam. How could I know? You didn't say I'd have to write and answer questions. I thought in your line of work, you should be a skilful liar. Give me your hand. Thank you. - What is this? - For your time. I didn't come for this! Take it back. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. Imagine that you took it without me noticing. Take me back. You know, the usual way. You know nothing about me! You grew up in a huge palace. I was born under the stairs. - What? - Yes, I can't read. - I steal from the rich. - What... Your kind has been stealing from the poor for centuries. I am sorry! - I don't steal from anyone! - You don't need to. Your ancestors did all the work. - Who built your palace? - My grandpa. - Right. - Mm-hmm. And how many serfs did he have? One thousand? Two? Ten. Gee up! Move! I didn't mean to offend you. You're right. I don't know anything about poor people's lives. I mean ordinary people. Why do you want to study? What for? Isn't it obvious? Scientists can use their knowledge to make the world better. Cure the incurable diseases. Make life better for everyone, not just the rich. Do you understand? Whoa! We've arrived! I don't even know your name. Alisa Maria Augusta von Schlessenburg-Vyazemskaya. And your name? Matvey. Simply Matvey. Still, I must thank you somehow. I'd rather… Come with me. Not now! In the evening maybe? We'll go for a walk, skate along the canals. I'll show you a different St. Petersburg. Matvey, are you asking me on a secret date? Well, yes. Well, this is too much! I meant to go for a walk! Give me my coat. You can't go any further. - It's five kopeks! - Wait. So what about… Maybe one day. Merry Christmas, my friend! Thank you. May luck be always on your side, and a pretty woman by your side! Thanks! Merry Christmas! Come and buy! How about a cuppa? Huh? - Here you go. - Thank you, sir. Watch out! - Watch where you're going! - I'm sorry. This is yours. I don't know what I love more, your generosity or your wisdom. I thought there's no such thing as too many diamonds. Alisa! Don't you want to try on your new jewellery? Trust me, dear daughter, yours is no less luxurious. It's beautiful. - Thank you. - Marvellous! Yes, it's very pretty. - For your present we'll go... - Where? - To the courtyard. - Ah. I am not peeking. I am not peeking! Voilà! A horseless carriage. Only three of them in St. Petersburg. One belongs to the emperor, one to banker Ryabushinsky, and one to my wonderful beloved husband. You are a darling. How far will this thing go? As far as the first pothole? That's right. We'll learn to fly before we learn to fix our roads. Fyodor, potholes are our strategic advantage over our western partners. As long as our roads are bad, we're invincible. - How does this thing work? - Piece of cake. Here. You press this pedal and steer as you wish. Use this here to stop. That pedal. That's it. Let's see. It's not moving! - Which pedal? - The right one. Ah. Ah! Careful! Where are you going? An interesting toy indeed. A toy? Are you joking? - It has the power of ten horses. - Mm. And none of them poos on the road. - And now a present for Alisa. - Get it quick! A house for your furry friend. - Thank you. - I have a splendid idea! Let's go to the Christmas service by locomobile. Wonderful idea! Right, Alisa? I'm still unwell. - Mm. - I'd like to stay home if you allow. What are you doing here? It's Christmas. I have a small present for you. What? Someone could see you! But I promised to show you St. Petersburg at night! - Matvey, are you insane? - Watch out! I can't just leave the house, especially at this hour. I'll help you. Matvey! Everything's fine. - Let me do it. - Wait. Matvey, I'm a bad skater, you've seen me. We'll sort that out. Good. Now a bit faster. I can't do it. Nonsense. Just stop thinking about it, and you'll be fine. Let's do it together. - One… - One… - Two! - Two! One… Hold onto me and don't look down. One, two. One, two. Forget about everything and look forward. That's it. That's Lions' Bridge ahead of us. If you go under it, any wish comes true. My father lights all these street lamps. - He does? - Yes. Oop. Huh? - Don't be scared. - What are you doing? Look. Look at those antlers! CINISELLI CIRCUS Whoa! May I? "…than to hear it 100 times." - What's he got there? - Cover me. - Where are you going? - Right. It's flour. Ah, I know! Diffusion increases reaction surface! - You know? - No. - It's good! - Thank you. Thank you. - How do I… - Just bite it. Listen, let's go look at the wrestlers. - Hmm? But what about the swing? - We'll be back. Matvey! HOT PIROZHKI What a surprise! Alex, Margo. Alisa. - Hm? - Good evening. I do remember Alisa. - Alisa? - What are your plans? - We wanted... - May I? Go for a walk, just you two? So boring! Opa! Quantity becomes quality. It takes time to heat water, but it boils in an instant. In a blink of an eye it'll start to boil, and this empire will go up in a big cloud of steam. So you think that in order to achieve social justice, the majority must give up all their property? The majority doesn't have any. They are not the problem. The problem is the class of usurpers that must be replaced with a people's council. Here! Read this book. It'll help make sense of things. It's my Christmas present for you. Here's to the Christmas present! Yes! Thank you. CAPITAL But let's take your example with water. Steam is still water, H2O. The same substance, only its form changes. Will there be any serious change if you replace one minority of usurpers, as you call them, with another? See? Their unwillingness to give up privilege is why peaceful change is impossible. - Yes! - Matvey, what do you think? I think we need to focus on what we have in common, not our differences. Why are you listening to her? She's a bourgeois. What else would she say? And this wheedler will agree with anything she says just to get under her skirt. It's clear as day! Apologize. I'm gonna let you in on a secret. They are all the same in certain places. Duchesses… and peasant girls alike! Son of a bitch. What? A fight? Order them to stop! I can't order them around. I can make a suggestion. Do it then. I suggest you stop fighting! - He's messing with the wrong guy. - Why are you being so rude? And you, cool off. - Alex! - Shh! No good party without a fight! - Sounds like a toast! - Where you going? Wait. Matvey! Thank you. I'm home in one piece, but you… I'll be as good as new in no time. Matvey, I wish this night never ended, but… But what? I must tell you something. They're planning to marry me off. But… You really wanted to study. Are you really going to marry without love? Love is nothing more than blind sexual instincts that… …control our behaviour. You should go. Goodbye. This is splendid! We only live once, let's drink up! Booze! Hey, buddy, pour me a shot of caraway vodka! Let's make it two. Or rather, three! And let us be free! Hey, buddy! Keep them coming! I'll buy the whole pitcher! Today I'm a rich man! I am rich, keep the change. Thank you. Cheerio! Sir, you dropped your wallet. My wallet. My little wallet. Marusya! Where are you going? You'll fall and hurt yourself! Ladies and gentlemen! I would like to wish you all a merry drunken afternoon! Stop! Police! I've got you, scoundrel. Go home. I said go home. Now! Fly! Let's beat it! Make way! Down! Make way! - Make way! - Out of my way! - Make way, everyone! - Make way! Whoa. - Spin me! - All right! Dive! Fly! Let's do it! Let's split up. Matvey! Thank you. You won't get away. Mm-hmm. Thank you. You're very lucky. The bullet missed the bone. Careful. I recommend avoiding any physical activity. Take this for the pain. Thank you. Miss Jackson, Alice, greetings. Oh my goodness! What happened? - Slight injury on duty. - Aww! Plus I couldn't miss the chance to see Alice again. May I accompany you? Go on. What I wanted to tell you at the rink... Your attention is flattering, Count, but my interests lie in other areas. I'm sure any girl would be happy... I know. What? Dear Alisa, I know you're different. You're a smart, modern girl. A 20th century woman. Trust me, our views are more similar than you think. All right then. What are your views on higher education for women? You might find it hard to believe but… I'm liberal. I support full equality for women. In all matters. Including the suffrage. But we don't have elections. Count, you sit next to Alisa. And now I will need assistance of two people. A man and a woman. Yin and yang. Their energies will bring the elements together for my next act. Severina, please do me the honour of choosing two assistants. Yes. I think Alisa and Arkady are perfect for this. Amazing. Alisa and Arkady, please come to me with your candles. Alisa, please stand to the left, the side of the heart. Arkady, stand to the right. And now, you will bring the flame of your candles to the surface of this bowl. Pay attention. Take care to do it simultaneously. One! Two! Three! Young people, I sense that your energies are destined for one another! If this is true, this flame will not harm me. Tremendous! Because of your energy, the flame is doing me no harm! Alisa! Like I said, extraordinary energy! This effect is known as cold fire. Alisa! To observe it, you mix… I am asking you to stop. …of ethanol and boric acid… Get off the stage! …and ignite the mixture. That's an order! It's cool to the touch. It's not magic. It's chemistry. I'm sure you know that when the alcohol begins to burn, the flame will become hot. I'm very sorry about this, ladies and gentlemen. Dad! - Alisa, I'd like... - Father! I want a word with you. - You never enter without knocking. - About tonight. What are you hiding? Hand it over. Looks like the Decembrists didn't teach anyone anything. Looks like all our problems stem from the fact that we stopped flogging our kids. Shall I fetch the rods? - Or do you have some just in case? - Your sarcasm is inappropriate. They're just books. You have no idea what kind of fire they can fuel! Burn them! CAPITAL What are you looking at? Get out. Ah. Good. Come on. I'm holding you. Repeat after me! Look at me! Now turn. Motya! Never look down. Always look forward. Now try without my help. Off you go. Without my help. Yes! Well done. Dad, I can skate. Look! Well done, Motya! Don't look down! Always look forward. Dad? Dad! Dad! Dad! Nothing good will come of money gained dishonestly. You have to give all this money back where it came from. Promise me, Matvey! I promise. I have decided I'm leaving tomorrow. Back to England. I saw something in your eyes today that made me realize so many things. I've spent my whole life living the life I never wanted. I kept swimming along the river of life knowing well in advance where it would take me, but I never found the courage to swim against the current. Here is my last lesson. Do not live by somebody else's rules. Live by your own. Do you know what you really want? Then promise me you'll follow your dream. Sometimes, the hardest decisions are the simplest ones to make. Keep it. I can't. I made a promise. Where is Duke? He'll be back. Is that your final decision? Then why bother to come here? I wanted to tell you in person. An oath to your father is sacred. You can't break it. Who? Stop! I said stop! Fyodor! It's a girl. ♪ Give me your sweet caress Let's live as if it was a dream ♪ Nothing happened to Duke! I'm sure he just went to see Dusya, he'll roll up in the morning. Duke never… She’s been looking for you. Alisa? I've left home. I'm going to Paris. I'll study at the university. They have the best chemistry school. I brought jewellery. Enough to pay for the tickets and for your father's treatment. Here. You'll be warm all night. This room isn't as cosy as yours, but I hope you get a good night's sleep. Yes. I'm glad you paid me a visit that time. Where will you sleep? Downstairs. This is Alex's cabin. Ah. Tomorrow we'll go to the station. To check the next train to Paris. Good night. Good night. Matvey! What would you say if I asked you to come to Paris with me? Say something in French. The first thing that comes to mind. Je t'aime. What does that mean? Gentlemen! You are surrounded! Resistance is futile! Come out one by one with your hands up, or we'll be forced to take measures! The cops are there! You have 30 seconds! Your time is up, gentlemen! Go! The ship is on fire! We're surrounded! They're everywhere. The police are there. We wanted to discuss that. Remember how you said you'd give up your privileges for common people? Don't, she's nothing to do with it! She won't get hurt. We'll just trade her for our freedom. - I can't breathe. - We're leaving, darling. We have no time for your chivalry! Alex! Alex! - You go! - What about you? Go. I know what I'm doing. Over here! Your hand! Go! Come on! Stop! That way! Grab the girl! Let go of me! Go. From this side. Like from the balcony. Let me go, bastard! What about you? How will you get out? I'll follow you. No need to rush. Like I said, never forget who you are. - Alex… - What's that? No! And where you come from. He's alive. Is that all of them? I have a hostage! A noblewoman! A minister's daughter. Her name is Alisa. Is he bluffing? Don't shoot! Let her go! She has nothing to do with this. First you let them go, then we talk. You'd better hurry, or you'll have no one to save. Get them up. And him. But he's a traitor! Yes, but he's our traitor. Look how they've worked him over. Now it's your turn! I need a guarantee that you'll let them go. An officer's word. You're free to go. Hold on to the rope. Catch her! Matvey! Hit again if that makes you feel better. - No! - Should we let the bandits get away? Get the bastards. Get them! She'll be just fine. Fine? I'll never see her again. I am talking about her, not you. Stop! I'll shoot! So this is what an officer's word is worth these days. You thought you two had a chance? This country with its centuries-long history is based on guys like you not being together. We love each other. The country has nothing to do with it. Hmm. An interesting idea. You need to go. The ice has melted. Run and jump. And you? The captain leaves last or sinks to the bottom. See you on the other side. - Who's on the prow? - Hmm? Oh! Got him. No! Your daughter is deeply sorry. She didn't know who else to turn to. I am sure it won't happen again. Nikolay Nikolayevich, find it in yourself to forgive her. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Gee up! Grigoriy Anatoliyevich, fishermen have brought a frostbitten boy. Put him down here. The boy was lying by the water. We checked, and he seems alive. Or he seemed. Heat some water. We have successfully liquidated a gang of dangerous pickpockets who worked on canals and ice rinks. The leader was a repeat offender Alexey Tarasov, also known as Alex. We have found a stash of valuables. I believe this watch is the grand duke's family heirloom stolen from him on the imperial rink. Ah, Alisa! Congratulations. Arkady has askedme for your hand in marriage. And I said yes! Fyodor, champagne! Ha-ha! Hurrah! Hurrah! Countess. Beautiful. We're so happy for you two! We'll announce the engagement tonight at the New Year's Eve ball. Right? Congratulations. This is a happy omen! Always look forward. Got it? Now you try. Don't look down. Always look forward. Back from the dead is what you are. Here. Matvey. Your father was brought here. Take care. One moment. Grigoriy Anatoliyevich! Thank you for everything. His Excellency is waiting for you in the locomobile. Duke von Schlessenburg-Vyazemsky and spouse. Nikolay Nikolayevich! Welcome to our humble masquerade! Greetings, Severina Genrikhovna. Ah, to mark the occasion, I have a small gift for you. My watch! You found it! I will most certainly tell my royal nephew about your efforts. Thank you, but credit for this goes entirely to Count Arkady Trubetskoy. Of course, I remember you. The ice skates! Our old family legend has it that this watch is the only valuable Marie Antoinette took from Versailles when it was stormed by those peasants in red caps. And guess where she hid this watch? Where? I dare not say in front of the ladies. - Please. - Thank you, Your Highness. Count Olsufiev and spouse. What is this mess? Gather this, quickly! Don't stand around! Do you know what it costs? It's exotic fruit! - Here you go. - Thank you. I'm not your enemy. You'll get to know me with time, and then… Excuse me, Count, I need to step out. I'll accompany you. - Count! - Can't I go alone? Count! Don't go by! Of course. Do me an honour, Count! Come on! Hey, fellow, give us some. Alisa. Alisa. I bought two tickets. We can still make it to Paris. What are you doing? Is he bothering you? Get back to work. Now. On this joyous occasion at the turn of the century, I'd like to announce that my family has some happy news. Alisa and Count Arkady Trubetskoy are engaged to be married! - Hurrah! - Count, where is Alisa? I'll go fetch her. The new year starts in one minute! Let's count down together! Sixty! Fifty-nine! Fifty-eight! Fifty-seven! Fifty-six! Fifty-five! Fifty-four! She was standing over there. Fifty-two! Fifty-one! FROM ST. PETERSBURG TO PARIS Hurry! Four! Three! Two! One! Hurrah! Hurry. Yah! - Attention! - We can make it. - Nord Express train to Paris. - This way! Now boarding. We'll make it. Yah! Make way! No horses allowed here! Stop! Count Trubetskoy, fourth division. These Russians. St. Petersburg drives people crazy. Bon voyage. May I see your tickets? Thank you. - And yours? - There are two. - No, only one. - What? I don't understand. I had two. - Let us in. We'll pay. - Sure, in the ticket office. You have five minutes. - I'll go with you. - No. I'll be quick. You're tired. Get in. - Get in. - Are you getting in? - Thank you. - Come in please. Are you traveling without luggage? Yes. Don't worry, I'll be quick. This way please. Thank you. Don't let her out if I don't make it. - Uh… - Please! Get in, please. - Matvey! - Where are you going? Are you crazy? The train's moved off. Matvey! Your Nobleness! Matvey! Please! Your Nobleness! There's no blood. - You… - Here's the second ticket. Wait, are you alright? I am. What can I say. Go to your compartment. They are magical. FOUR YEARS LATER - Dmitry Ivanovich! - Yes? I know my daughter has been privately corresponding with you for some years now. Since you know and talk about it, I wouldn't call it private. - You haven't mentioned it to me. - Don't worry, sit down. Dmitry Ivanovich, as a specialist in the field of chemistry, what can you tell me about her achievements? You heard that? As a specialist. Amusing. Well, as a specialist, I must tell you that during this time she has achieved outstanding results. Moreover, I am convinced that next year she will get an academic title, which is unprecedented for a female student. Yes. And then the world of science will welcome her open-armed. And the best European universities will be delighted to have her. Mm. Mm-hmm. And… what about Russian universities? Nikolay Nikolayevich, the Charter doesn't allow women to teach at the university. It's not the Bible. We can amend it. Right. Right? What's that here? Huh? We mix the required quantities of boric acid and ethanol and add sulphuric acid, which acts as a catalyst when heated. The vapours of triethyl borate produce a blue flame… …that is cool to the touch. Look at this. Beautiful, isn't it? I love demonstrating this experiment. I have a personal story connected to it. - Alisa Nikolayevna! - Yes? - Tell us. - Please do! Very interesting! I promise I will, but some other time. And now let's look at this reaction in the language of chemistry. We mix ethanol with boric acid and sulphuric acid… Her lectures are immensely popular. It produces a blue flame. Which is what? Cool to the touch. Cool to the touch! - But be careful, promise? - Sure. Let's go. Good. Don't look down. Always look forward. Well done. You're already doing great! And now try without my help. Look at him! He takes after his father. Aaah! - Petya, look! - Look what daddy can do! Splendid, isn't it? Go on. Well done!
