I could do nothing for you. You're sacrificing your life for your Motherland. What more can you do for me? Go, son. Long Live, India. The General will still pardon you. Tell him the whereabouts of the traitors and save yourself. I know just one traitor. And that's you! Long Live, India! 1 942 - 9th August In every corner of India, there was but one echo... Quit India! We'll do, or die. As the Independence Movement spread, ...the atrocities of the British worsened. The man behind them was General Douglas. Who murdered many unarmed men. And hung many a freedom fighter. But even in death, they had but one thing to say. ''We'll do, or die!'' ''We'll do, or die!'' ''1 2 dead in Delhi in police-firing'' - They razed the whole town. - Easy. Go on reading. General Douglas is going back to England on the 25th... ...on promotion! If I had my way, I'd hang the bloody dog! Carry on reading. Before that,there'll be a Regimental Farewell Parade at Kasauni. How long will he be there? For a day. Just one day. One day, eh? There's Govind there. And Mr Baig too. This is the only chance to finish him off!. The General will go to Kasauni... but, never return! - Father, this is my... - No, son. Only one man for this job! ...Shubhankar! You can help him. But first, I'll go there myself. To make the bomb. Inform Govind today itself. But don't tell him anything about the mission. Just say, I'm not keeping well. So I'm coming there for treatment. Very soon. It has sprouted here too, eh? Great! Just listen to them; We'll do, or die. More will die, than do, sir. Then what are you waiting for? Shoot them. They too must know the repercussions of... ...raising their voice against the British Raj. And this is being done because the General is coming here. Some trouble's brewing. It's not the General who's coming, but some calamity. Let it be the General or Hitler. What's it to you? Just shut up! How can I? Firing in Delhi; Curfew in Old Delhi. Women raped by soldiers, and you exxpect me to keep quiet? If ever this man crosses my path, I swear, I'll spit on him. He'll be here nextx week. Spit on him and fulfill your wish. I'll do that, if your father doesn't kill me first! Put your tail in, eh? Coward! Spit on Douglas, will you? If I had my way, I'll kill each one of them! This fire has been ignited by some outsiders. As long as I'm the C.O. here, nobody will dare to commit treason. It won't last... the British Rule won't last long. Pull that flag down. Lower that flag. Push them back! Hey! Look what's happening. Stop him! Go, man. What are you doing? Gone mad? Your father's livid. Let's go. You should be ashamed! My son, doing such a thing? I'll not put up with this at all. At least think of my reputation. If you're dying for Independence too... ...then remove the Western clothes. Wear Khadi ones, and stand at crossroads and shout slogans! Did you hear what I said? They are here again? The Government has confiscated their land and money. They'll starve. When their son was siding with the traitors, were they sleeping? If you allow them in here again, you'll be out! Understand? What's happened? What has never happened before! Fights, riots, madness! Here I am, trying to hold on to my status and there,your darling son... - What about him? - Gets beaten up by a constable! Heavens! He's not hurt, is he? You're alright, aren't you, son? Hey! She's not here. But I know where she is. - Where? - It was lying here. Does this ear-ring belong to somebody close to you? Yes; it does. Where had you gone with this horse? To find her...the girl in the bus. - What bus and which girl? - That bus in the Town's square. Whose glass was stoned; that's when I saw her and kept on staring. I must admire your sight. In all that riot, noise, stoning, you saw someone, and kept on looking... - Don't laugh; but come with me. - How can I? Come home tomorrow. We'll find her by afternoon. Our town's so small. Nobody can get lost, even if one wishes to! Tomorrow it is! Come now. Where are you running me off to? May I ask you something? When the whole country's burning, how could you think of love? If everyone thought of Love, why would India burn at all? See this? Great! People pick pockets. Did you cut-off somebody's ears? By this, you can imagine how the wearer must be! I could guess wrongly, so better tell me yourself. Very beautiful. In fact, even that doesn't do justice to it. When I saw her, it was as though... You understand, don't you? I'll exxplain it. - I saw her, and... - I got that. Go on. When I saw her, I felt as though... Do one thing. Think all night and tell me when you come tomorrow. Bye! Hey! When I saw her, it was as though...as though what? How come you found your way here so early today? You're getting worried, but he's hardly aware of the time and duty. You're too lenient with him. As they say... When a mouse finds a turmeric-root, it thinks itself to be a grocer! Open the door, friend. His door may break, but he won't wake! Show affection to someone, who's worth the trouble. Understand? Let's go... Let's go, I say. Where are you? - What's the matter? Let's go. - Where to? - To look for that girl. Where else? - But I found her. - Found her? Where? - Up There. This one? Is this the cartoon you saw and lost your heart to? She's Aunty! Whom have you fallen for? Tea, father. - What's wrong? - I'm alright. You go. Have you told her? No, I haven't. She has suffered enough already. And this mission is so dangerous, she'll worry unnecessarily. You did well. I told my wife that you're here to take treatment. She got worried. She said ask him to stay with us. - Else, I'd have... - No, this room will do. I'll be coughing away here and nobody will disturb us. My wife wants to go to her Mother's. - Why? - After 1 2 years... ...God has smiled on her. She's pregnant. Really? That's good news. Congratulations. - These books? - They're my daughter's. - A voracious reader. Pens poems too. - Really? We've a good library here. Good! Then she'll be happy here. When I go to Abid Ali, I'll drop her here. - Coming; You're up, are you? - What are you eating on the sly? - Have some. It's Holy offering. - Give some to Master Naren too. - What's this? - Don't get scared. He's the driver of an aristocrat. Very fond ofjust one thing. Non-stop chatter! I'll do one thing. I'll tell him about your illness. By evening, the whole town will know you're here for treatment. Father, your medicine. Careful, my dear friend. Never mind the father. Tell me about the daughter. She must be able to support herself. She's gone to the library. Hold on. I lied for you for the first time in my life. Actually it opens at 9 A.M. But I told him, at 8 A.M. The watchman there is related to me. Bribe him and he'll open it earlier. After that, it's just you and her. On that first meeting... Recite a lovely couplet to her, like my uncle had recited. My aunt was drying her hair in the sun, and my uncle... Let me go, please. No poetry. I just knew you'd come here in search of knowledge. This library is a Trove of Knowledge. Books? These are scientific. They tell, why the sky is blue. And these are of literature, telling why did Juliette love Romeo! And these are of accounts, that tell this is our 3rd meeting. Yesterday, in the bus. Today morning on the swing; And now, here. Since we're discussing accounts, naturally one wishes to know... Who are you; Where you've come from...and also what is your name! Are you the librarian here? Do I seem one to you? Anyway, you at least enquired. Now ask me, where I come from, and my name too! Go on, ask me. - Let go of me. - Go on, ask. I have one thing of yours which you will get, only if you ask me my name. - Let me go. - Ask me my name then. What impertinence! Let me go. You're cross over such a small issue? Go on, ask me. Look at the ironies of life. We both yearned to meet. And when we are, it's on the sly, like a couple of thieves! - Nobody saw you come? - No. The General has a very tight security. But one thing is certain. He'll definitely attend the drama, we're presenting to welcome him. He'll be in the balcony. It's a difficultjob, no doubt. - Shubhankar is coming, isn't he? - Yes. Here's the raw material for the bomb. And this is the map of the hall. - Is your daughter with you? - Yes, but she doesn't know this. Good! Send her to the rehearsal and send me the news through her. - Now we'll not meet again. - Is this a final one then? God forbid! - Victory to India! - Amen! Who is it? Just one minute. - Why did you close the door? - I felt very cold. Keep it here. - Lovely! - Come on now, start eating. - You look very happy. - It's a lovely place. - I feel like staying here only. - Then do. The library's good too, I hear. Such a library, such books... Such people even. Never seen before. You had gone to see Uncle Baig. How is he? Fine. He's busy with a play. Has called you for assistance. - Me? - Yes. Tomorrow, at 1 0 A.M. And tell him he has forgotten to give me the white medicine. Good! You at least found time here, to think of your treatment. You'll get well here soon. I just feel it. - Why does aunty shout so? - But she means well. So go now. One soldier on that balcony and another one here. You on that gate, and you, on the other. Ten soldiers in the hall. Four soldiers up here. And you shall be at the gate with your whole platoon. - Wonderful! Don't trust me even? - Am I mad, sir? Do I want to invite my death by suspecting you? - Then why are you here? - Just for security. Ever since the general's arrival, the treachery is on the rise. Where everyone knows each other, nobody will dare come. You don't know their guts. There's a revolutionary present here itself. What? Who? See over there. Here? She's a sweet, promising and a decent girl. Acts well too. Who'll guess she's your kid? You teachers leave nobody! Not even your friends. What was that couplet you recited? ''O friend, you're my foe...'' ''Any man, whom you befriend...'' ''Why should the sky be his foe?'' Please go! We're getting late here. I've to go on some urgent errand too. Alright, my dear. See sir? She calls the shots even here! God bless you! Why don't you understand? I must go. - She must've come. You manage here. -Manage, my foot! Will I play Romeo? - Where are you going? - It's imperative that I go. The rehearsal's important too. You're forgetting the lines, not me. You talk of books? He's forgotten his name! - Books? What books? - The one with lines in them. - Keep jabbering. I'm going! - Stop him! I can't! I must go. - What's the urgency for books? - You won't understand. Go on then... Why did you stop? When is the General coming? - Yes, when is he exxpected? - Nextx week. Why? And I'm leaving? We're doing this for him, aren't we? You're right. I must learn my lines. I don't know why I forget them. - The General will sit here... - Baig Uncle. - My dear! How are you? - I'm fine. That are you! If you help me in this, I'll say you're even finer! Uncle, daddy said... - Do I put some flowers here too? - Yes, all over. Yes, what did he say? He said you forgot the white medicine. Tell him, I'll send it today. Take this. The actors always forget their lines. Prompt them, please. Put phosphorous in a medicine bottle and give it to Mr Pathak. - Tell him, when Shubhankar arrives.. - Is he coming? This moon shines through you. Shall I swear by it? No. It waxxes and wanes. Don't swear by it. I believe in you. My body, mind and life... - What are the following lines? - Lines? But what's your name, dearest? Knowing name is not knowing a person. It's just a name, not a virtue. Had the rose been known as a thorn, it would still smell as sweetly. If water had been called fire, it'd still be cool. Change my name, if you will, but I'll still be the same. I'll always love you... what's the nextx line? - ''Because you are you...'' - Yes. Because you are you. I know that it wasn't an act. It was your love for me. How easily you put across your true feelings. And I...I don't even know your name. You know I wasn't acting. It was my love. For you. You! What are you doing here? Go away. - You didn't ask me my name. - Softly. They'll wake up. Go now. - I'll come up then. - What the hell! Don't come up. Don't come up, I said. You'll fall! Don't ever let go of this hand. Else, I'll die. - Don't say that. - Okay, I won't. Just let me look at you to my heart's content. Those lips; these eyes; These eyelashes... Leave me. Go away. Somebody may wake up. Go! Okay. But promise to come early tomorrow. - Where? - The Rehearsal Hall. - Okay, I'll come a bit early. - Not a bit early; before everyone. - Okay, go now. Someone may hear. - How can I go? - Why not? - You're holding on to my hand. - Listen... - Yes? - You didn't tell me. - What? - Your name? - My name? We've got a message from the H.Q. There's a plot to kill the General. Some are here; and more exxpected. They also have material for a bomb. The H.Q. have requested the Army for help. Call an officer's meeting at once and arm the 2 companies concerned. Careful. Tell Mr Baig that the job is done. Keep the bomb here in this room. It's raining heavily. The roads are teeming with police. They're searching all the houses. Our friends are exxpected. What now? Get a hold of yourself!. Let's go. Carry on with the rehearsal. I'll be back soon. Right, Sir. Come on, let's get on with it. - Someone will snatch you from me... - Who can dare to do that? Has anyone ever snatched life from one's body? Sleep from the eyes... And thirst from the lips? Time can, if it wills. No! That's not true! I'll snatch you from Time itself then. - Promise me Rajjo... - I'm not Rajjo, Naren. It's just that... Wait! Please listen to me. Forgive me, but don't blame me. Blame my love. Is it necessary to flaunt love? I wasn't flaunting. They were my true feelings. And I truly love you. I can't live without you. Will you marry me? Rajjo was right. I'm just coming from down. The atmosphere is tense. I think the Army has come to know about our mission. - Your life's in danger. Go at once! - And leave my work incomplete? Our friends are coming tomorrow. I can't leave. I'm here. I'll manage it all. Your life... Don't worry about my life. You said your wife wished to visit her mother's place. - Send her tomorrow morning. - And what about Rajjo? I'll take care of her. - It's a riot there and you sit here! - You! I thought it was her. - Now scoot from here. - Ofcourse. I'll run all the way. But it's your turn now. So run! She's leaving town. Lock, stock and barrel. I saw her luggage being loaded. The bus will leave soon. So, run! I'm telling the truth. Better hurry, and go! I've been telling for days now. Pack my things. But who listens? Careful! Keep it safely. - When will we start? - As soon as we can. I've to go to Nurgadh. - On the other side of the pass. - Sure! We'll go there too. Hey! You won't get a seat. The bus may go too. Come on. If we don't get a seat, we'll have to go standing all the way! - And keep on eye on things. - Are you coming with us, or not? I thought you... You can never leave me. Promise me, dear, that you'll never leave me. What is it? I was little late in coming. Aunty's gone to her mother's. I had to see her off at the bus stand. And I thought you went away forever. Never to return. And suppose, I do have to go one day? Then I'll die. I'll really die. Promise me that you will never leave me! How can I ever leave my father alone and go? And what of me? Can you leave me? Yes, I can... - Hey! What's wrong, dear? - Nothing. Then why the tears? Won't you tell me? If not you, then whom do I tell? Whom else do I have? Has anybody broken your heart? - Naren hasn't... - Papa... Why would he hurt me? I've hurt myself. I can't do the Juliette's role. Why not? I keep forgetting my lines. Is that any reason to cry? An army officer's daughter and look how she's crying! All these efforts are a waste. I just cannot laugh today. Perseverance never goes waste, dear. We both are persevering and living, aren't we? Else, when your mother died, leaving a 2-month old infant... I thought it was the end. Look, my dear. I can bear to see everything. But not tears in your eyes. An army-officer... And see how he's weeping! Alright. I'll never cry again. It's not a must that every girl be a Juliette. Some revolutionaries are coming here tonight. I'll do the patrolling myself. Make all the preparations. Catch him alive. Govind, get some water and bandages We've to dress his wound They killed Tyagi. - Shubhankar...wired us... - Yes, go on. Douglas... He's not coming on 25th. But 1 0 days later. With a great difficulty... This pistol...Shubhankar's. My dear. Your one more brother has gone! But we'll win. We'll definitely win! As long as we're together... Shubhankar is not alone. You are with me, aren't you? Tell me. Surround this house, men. Must be hiding here only. Don't let him escape. Hurry! Open the door. We've to search this house. -But I'm the manager of his Lordship. - And we have a warrant to search. - We've chased a traitor here. - But no traitor has come here. Get aside! Come with me, men. You go here. And you lot, there. The rest follow me! Didn't I say nobody's here? Disturb us for no rhyme or reason? - See? Nobody's here. - Keep quiet. Let us do our duty. We'll do, or die! - How did things change overnight? - We can never be one! Forget that you ever loved a revolutionary's daughter. Forget that we ever met. Don't try to meet me now. I'm going. Forever. Told him everything? Didn't think of our ideals? You told him of our revolution? If he gets the police, you didn't think what will happen to us? - Go from here. - No. I've come to your father... For what? What do you want? Why have you come? To tell you whatever she told me, will not be revealed. Believe me. It's impossible to trust those, ...who've sold themselves and their souls! I'm here before you, and my soul's with me too! Yes, I can see that! No, you're not! Now I am. So tell me. I wanted to say that I respect your ideals and patriotism. I don't want to argue, but if you try and meet her again... You'll kill me? Go ahead. But till my end, I'll always say... ...that I love Rajjo and wish to wed her! You fool! When the country's resoun -ding with the cry of ''Quit India''.. ...you fret over Love and romance? - Love is not a sin! - Yes it is! It is a sin. A man who's not a patriot, can love nobody on earth! It's all humbug! That's unfair, sir. Your love for... ...your nation is great! And our's is nothing? When I can understand your patriotism try to understand my love too. I know I'm my father's son. I also know she can't come into my world. But I can leave that world and come into yours, sir. I'll leave that house, wealth, money...everything, sir. I'll leave it all. But she's mine. You cannot separate us. I'll come tomorrow morning. After having taken my Mom's blessings. I'll come and seek yours. Why are you sitting here alone? You seem upset. What is it? I'm leaving home, mom. What! Bring your girl here. Don't be afraid, son. I'll convince your father. I've never asked anything of him. But for you, I'll do so today. He won't be able to refuse. Bring her here. She'll never agree. I can't bring her here. But why not? She's a daughter of a revolutionary. Her brother laid down his life for the country. Dad will never accept her. I've hurt you very much, haven't I? No, my dear. It's I who has hurt you all. It's always been ''I'', ''mine'', ''my ideals''. The English didn't kill my son. I did! I only taught him about patriotism. About dying for the country. But he became a martyr... Did you say... Yes. That don't cry for martyrs. Your Mother. I killed her too. Bearing the load of life, and awaiting me for hours... ...her eyes turned to stone. My dear, because of me, I don't want your life... You have a full right to lead your life. My life is with you Had you told me before, I'd not have even looked at Nandu. Let alone love him! But now you do, don't you? Don't think me weak. I'm your daughter. - Will you forget him? - Yes. Absolutely! I'll never even give him a thought. If he comes, I'll say I've nothing to do with him. Why should he be after me? There are plenty of girls around. - I'll forget everything. - But he loves you. Wants to marry you. But I don't wish it. Honestly, I don't. Look at me and tell me that. He's a good boy. He's willing to discard everything for you. If you refuse him, I won't like it. You're very nice... Too good! You're going, son? Go. I won't stop you. Once you marry, all will be well. Take this. My blessings to her. I'll take this to her. But give her your blessings yourself. I'll come in the night, with her. Don't sleep. Await us. May I go now? I'm His Exxcellency speaking. I wish to talk to the Major. - No! What are you doing? - Get aside! Run, my dear! Run! He has got the soldiers. No! Soldiers! Run! ...Just run! Give this to Shubhankar and ask him not to give up! I'll follow you later. Don't argue! Time's running out. I want to go to my father. I want to go to him. I should go back. - What's back there? - Father's there. I must go back. - You can't go back there. - I must go back! - Be sensible! He's not there. - Then where is he? - He's a martyr now! - You're lying! He can't leave me alone and go! He's alive. He can't be dead! I can understand how you feel. I too have lost my father. But his death had hung my head in shame! I saw that traitor dying a death of a coward, in public! Your father stood by me then. He taught me the meaning of self-respect and patriotism. Today I'm proud! For he became a martyr. And one doesn't shed tears for martyrs! Remember? What your father had said, when Douglas hung his son? I remember. What have you done to my son? But I'm not sad by your death. You died for your country. Don't cry, my dear. It's an insult to them. Promise me, that you'll never cry. Go on, promise me. I promise. I'll never cry again. Dad had said... As long as we both are alive... ...Shubhankar is not alone. I'm still alive. So, you're not alone. Together, we'll both flutter the Tricolour of father's dream! Yes! You and I. We'll flutter the tri-colour of his dreams! Do you remember that song? Which father, my brother, you and I... All sang together? How do you feel now, son? Where is Rajjo? Everything will be fine. Not ''will be''. I've seen to it, that all ''is fine'' ! To trap the boys of the rich, these people ''use'' their daughters! But we can straighten such lowly rats too. My phone pleased the English. My son was saved. And that man and his daughter were blown to bits! Yes, Major? What! I've been made a Lord? It was my life-long dream to get this title. I wanted that at any cost! Celebration? Ofcourse. I'll have such a grand affair that this town will never forget it! Yes! I'm just awaiting the General now. If you go, do you think I'll stay? Your father employed my father. Not me! I'm here because of you. If you stay, I stay. If not, I go too. No! You won't leave that house. My mother will be lonely without me. You'll stay there, for her sake. Promise me. Okay, I promise. For her sake. - Bye, then. - Where are you going? - To find Rajjo. - But when that bomb exxploded... Atleast you don't say that. She's alive. My heart tells me. Okay. Sit down. Your heart is right ofcourse. You had vowed to live and die together. How can she die alone? I'll have my meal and then we'll both go in search of her. It's a tiny town. Nobody can get lost, even wishing to! Okay? We'll find her. Where are the bombs hidden? And who all are with you? I won't tell you. Traitor! Because of you, my son left our home! You've served me for years and now you do treason with me? Tell us, where those traitors are! You may be knowing traitors; I know only patriots! You traitor! I'll kill you. We don't want corpses, but information! Don't cry. Nothing will happen. - I'm scared. They'll kill him. - Nothing will happen, I know. Here comes His Exxcellency. My husband's innocent. He has done nothing. Release him. He's innocent. We've served you all our lives. Only you can save him, sir. Only you can save, sir. Tell him, Munna. Sir, he's innocent. Let's go, driver. Why are you following me? Want to send soldiers here too? Don't say that, Mr Baig. My father sent those soldiers. I want to find Rajjo. She too will think, I'm her father's killer. Just let me meet her once. They are beating Govind brutally. His wife is unconscious on the road. Come inside; Quick. Take this. How many more will you kill? Rajjo is out of your life. She's dead. Ten days! Because of the bomb-blast, Douglas will be here 1 0 days later. I'll have to wait for another 1 0 days. The town must be surrounded by soldiers. But your father's efforts will not go waste. I'll get Douglas before he enters the town. You're not alone in this. I'll be with you. I know you'll always be with me. But, I'll have to await that day... ...when the Tri-colour flutters in this country. Our dream will come true. And this earth will be ours! And in a small part of it, we'll have a small house. Just that Mr. Baig will leave the bag with the bomb in a shop. You'll bring it to the bus-station and meet me. Be careful. There'll be many soldiers there. Don't worry about me. Nobody will recognise me. I'm dead to them anyway. Wait Rajjo. Wait. Catch him! Let him not escape. You're alright, aren't you? Stop! Get down, all of you. You go ahead. Out! Get down one by one. Get along. Hurry up! - We've surrounded the place. - Anybody saw him? No, sir. But he's somewhere here. Can't escape. I've seen him and I can identify him too. - Open this bo xx. - I don't have the key. This one? Is he the one? - Yes or no? - No! Look again. No. It's not him. - What's in that? - Tool-bo xx. - Open it and show. - Okay... - Stop! - Run, Shankar The Major wants you. Hurry! Lock him up! Is this that man? Yes. That's him. The General will be here soon. Get those blood-stains washed. It took so much time. So many died. And we lost everything in one moment. Now we neither have a bomb, not a pistol. Suddenly, I am very tired. Who was following you? Who's he? You lied about Rajjo's death. Nobody can take her from me. She's mine, sir. - A man who got her father killed... - That's a lie! My father sent the soldiers. Not me. How many times must I tell you that? I didn't go there to betray him, but to ask for his daughter's hand. To tell him that I was willing to leave my world, and join him. I had told him that I was going home, only to seek Mom's blessing. She not only blessed me, but gave ''sindoor'' for Rajjo! I'd have put it in her hair-parting and we'd have been married. If not physically, emotionally we are husband and wife. British; Quit India. He's innocent, sir. Release him! He has done nothing. He's innocent, sir. If I had it my way, I'd kill you. I'm not a coward. I spat on him. - I'm not a coward. - No, you're not. You're not eating anything? After what happened today, can anyone feel hungry and eat? Those who break laws, have to face the punishment. Is asking for ''Independence'' a crime? Is that General a God to kill as he pleases? - And you? - Look, I'm an Army officer. It's my duty to carry out orders loyally. If it's your duty to shoot the unarmed... ...then tomorrow, I'll do my duty too. - Duty as an Indian. - What? I'll do what the patriots do. When they'll cremate Govind and Munna, I'll be among them too. You'll do nothing of the sort! What do you know of these traitors? And all those rehearsals you did. They were just a facade to pull wool over our eyes. They were meant to assassinate the General. And do you know who was behind it? My own friend, Mr Baig. Shankar has told us everything. Then go and call Mr Baig. We all have to die one day. But what you're doing is suicide. Think again calmly. You'll never get near him with this knife. You won't even get to touch him. Your life belongs to the whole nation, You can't afford to throw it away. I'll see. We've a warrant for your arrest. What's my crime? That, he'll tell. Forgive me, sir. They beat me mercilessly. Where's Shubhankar? - You told everything? - Where is he? - How do we leave town? - We'll have to cross Town Square. - We'll travel all night... - And reach there at dawn. As long as Douglas is here, I'll stay put. Put the Holy Water in his mouth. The name of the deceased, and your own name. Keep this rice on his chest. Mr Baig's life is in peril. The major's watching. Don't stop. Listen to me carefully. You two carry on. He's an old friend. Nothing will happen to me. Stop, Mr Baig. Your aim is the General. He should not escape. Who's with you? Stop them. Don't force me to shoot. Stop, I say. How will he kill the General? He has neither a bomb, nor a pistol. He must be having a gun, sir. He must! We're leading a shameful life; That of slaves. You live with a head held high; Take this. Bless you, son. I've to give you something too. Rajjo is alive. If you meet her, tell her I didn't betray her. I'm not a traitor to my country. You'll leave this house again, over my dead body! If that's what you, so be it. We've been living according to your wishes, anyway. You got Mr Pathak killed. I saw him blown to smithereens. I kept quiet, as your son. I lost Rajjo, and my life's love with her. I kept quiet, as I was your son. But today, it concerns the General. Our independence. The whole nation. I won't keep silent today, father. - Stop him! - You need to be stopped! - Else, we'll be slaves to ourselves. - So, you'll stop me, eh? Yes. I'll stop you! Remember? You had lifted the phone the last time I had left? But today...now... You'll have to decide. Who's side you're on. Ours, or the English? If you're on their side, I'll have to go over your corpse. - Make him see sense. - I swear by my mother. If you betray your nation again, I'll kill you. Who are you with? With us, or with the English? - I'm with you, son. - Then say, ''Long Live India'' ! - Say it! - Long Live India, son. I'm going. I won't cry. Dad had said, one does not insult the martyrs by weeping. Look after yourself. My pistol's been stolen. My son had come last night. I'm ashamed to call you my son! Who else is with you? The whole nation! The whole nation! ''Long Live India'' ! Indeed! Empty the square! No man should be seen. Remove every man. Hurry up! Dangle it down! Forgive me, Mother. I couldn't do anything for you. You're sacrificing your life for your Motherland. What more can you do for me? Go, son. Long Live India! The General will pardon you. Tell him about the traitors and save your own skin. I know but one traitor; And that's you, father. ''Long Live India'' Call the water-carrier and clean the blood-stains. Where's that water-boy? He's there somewhere. Come on, hurry up. Don't be afraid of their bullets. Stop them, Papa. They are shooting their own. Stop them. Don't run away! Stop! Stop! They can't do anything! Come back! Come back! Come back! Stop! Stop! Don't run away! Forgive me, my dear. You didn't do anything. You just did your duty. If firing at unarmed men is your duty... ...then I too shall do my duty. Duty of every Indian. Long Live India! ''India Forever'' The National Army will now salute. Everybody salute. Long Live India! Praise the Over-Lord of the people and their minds. The Maker of India's fortune. India, with her various states in the North, South, East and West... ...with her great mountain-ranges and Holy rivers... And turbulent waves of the Seas around her... Sings praises to your good-name; Seeks your blessings. And recites your pious tale. O, Over-lord of the people and their minds... And the Maker of India's fortune, Praise to Thee. Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna! Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
