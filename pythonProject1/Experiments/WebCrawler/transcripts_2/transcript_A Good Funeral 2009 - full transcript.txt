AND IT DIDN'T MATTER ANYMORE THAT WE NEVER GOT TO SEE HIM AS KIDS. HE'S MY DAD. AFTER THE CANCER-- HE DOESN'T HAVE CANCER, JUNIOR. WHAT? MAUDE, I NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TELLING THE TRUTH. HE LIED. TO YOU. TO US. TO ME. OF COURSE HE DID. YEAH. IT'S NO PARK WALK THINKING THAT YOUR HUSBAND'S DYING OF CANCER, LET ME TELL YOU. BUT LOOK, JUNIOR, IF I LEFT EVERY MAN OR EVERY DAD EVERY TIME HE DID SOMETHING TERRIBLE, I WOULD BE AN ALONE WOMAN. THAT'S LIFE. IT'S A BUNCH OF CHOICES. BUT JUNIOR, WHAT I DO KNOW, YOUR DAD'S GOOD, IT'S MORE THAN HIS BAD. THAT'S WHY I STAY WITH HIM-- FOR NOW. THAT SELFISH SON OF A BITCH! HOPE YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME. ( laughs ) ( imitating Three Stooges) NYUH NYUH. AH. WHAT'S IN THE BOTTLE, DAD? TIME. YOU TOLD US YOU WERE DYING. NO, YOU JUST BELIEVED THAT. I TOLD YOU I HAVE CANCER. A MOLE THAT DR. OLSON REMOVED. YOU LIED ABOUT THE MOTORHOME, THE SHOW, THE TRIP-- EVERYTHING. HONEY, IT WAS THE ONLY WAY THAT I COULD HAVE TIME WITH MY LITTLE GIRL. I'M NOT YOUR LITTLE GIRL! OKAY, I KNOW. I KNOW. BUT IT WAS REAL IMPORTANT TO ME THAT YOU DID COME... AND THAT MAUDE AND ME GOT SOME TIME WITH YOU AND THE TWINS. NO. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT YOU WERE ON THAT RETARDED SHOW! YEAH, YEAH, BUT NOT TO BE ON THE SHOW; TO BE A FAMILY-- TOGETHER. TO BE A FAMILY THAT WINS TOGETHER. ( scoffs ) SO WHAT? YOU KNOW HOW MANY MILES WERE ON THAT CAMPER WHEN GRAMPS DIED? TEN. TEN MILES. THAT'S THE DISTANCE FROM THE DEALERSHIP TO THEIR HOUSE. THEY OWNED THAT MOTORHOME FOR A YEAR, AND THEY NEVER ONCE USED IT. I'M NOT GONNA MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS MY DAD. MAYBE YOU JUST LOVED STAN MORE THAN HE COULD LOVE YOU BACK. WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT IT? YOUR MOM CALLED YOU EVERY DAY, ANDREW. WHAT DOES THAT MATTER? CLEARY, SHE LOVED YOU TO DEATH.
