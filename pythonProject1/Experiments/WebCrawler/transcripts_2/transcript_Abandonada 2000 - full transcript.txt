How is Edwin? I'm sorry, I wasn't able to stop Edwin from what he was planning. You've done a lot for me Emily. When I was imprisoned, you were the one updating me about my family. I was alone and Edwin didn't write at all. Didn't Edwin send you anything when he filed for separation from you? I didn't know. So he must have faked those documents to legalize your separation. Do you have any news about them? I don't… He and your child just vanished one day. Lucky you, your family's still complete. What are you saying? You still have your family Me... Us... We're both orphans but still family. Thank you. Hurry up, I'm hungry... Gemma! Gemma! Why are you home early? Shouldn't you arrive later? - Why? - I got a job! Really? I was accepted as a branch manager in National Life Insurance. I'm starting on the fifteenth. Come and eat then, I prepared something to eat. Come over here first. Son, Daddy's got a job. He's not going to hear you. But he's answering. Give me a kiss. One more, one more. Stop, the baby is crying Alright, come on already. Do you love me? What are you saying? Of course I love you! I love you too. Take care of the clothes as they might get soiled, hurry! Bless me, mother. What are you doing here? I already returned from Canada. Why did you return? Why did they allow you to return? Aren't you supposed to rot in prison? You should even be in the electric chair. Go ahead and transfer that. Mom, please don't be like that. Don't ever call me mom. Because I am ashamed to have you as my daughter-in-law. Before you got married, I told my son I didn't like you. I really don't like your face. I wasn't wrong. You put us all to shame. Your foolishness was published in all the newspapers. Get out of here before I call the police. - Are you done yet? - I just want to know where my family is. They're not here and for them, you've long been dead. Wow this is delicious! You should not have bothered, My dear is tasty. One more! - You really are… - Come on Marietta. Wait, I'll just get our dried clothes. - I'll leave you for now. - Sure, my love. Alright, fine, fine. Good evening Marietta. Can I talk to Nando? I heard he was on leave. He has visitors. Just for a moment Marietta. Can I? It's important. Marietta… Gemma? Nando! Hey Gemma! How are you? When did you arrive? Come inside with me. Your friend Jessie is there. No need. I'll stay here, I'm in a hurry. I just want to know where my family is. I know Edwin and you are friends, and he might have told you. When we were drinking one time… He told me where he would live in Manila. Where? Gemma, I think it's better if you don't look for them. Edwin, take care of Marco okay? Son… Mom, please take care of my family. Don't worry, I'll take care of them. - Gemma... - Emily... Check on Marco once in a while, okay? Yes… You also take care. Mommy will be back. Remember that I'm doing all of these for you. Bye! This should be good, One month advance payment, two months deposit. But are you sure you can sustain this in the next months? Yes. That's good. Come over here for a minute. If that's the case, we'll work well. By the way, every fifteenth, I knock and collect the payment. There's a phone here but long distance calls are prohibited. And most of all, overseas calls. And talking long hours. Is that clear? Clear. Try going to the address I gave you. Here's his phone number. He gave that to me long ago so I'm not sure if that's still active. Hello? Hello? Alright, Sir! Mom? How are you? Did you get the money I sent? Not enough? Then I'll send more. How much? Sure, no problem. For my mom, I'll do everything. Your birthday is nearing. I'll send money for your celebration too. Yeah, show it so you don't get tired. Gemma? When? Why didn't you call me then? What did you tell her? You might slip. She doesn't know where I am? Don't worry mom… The Philippines is too big for her to find me. What are you doing here? - Aren't you supposed to rot in prison? - Guilty! Guilty! Gemma Arcilla, I want to invite you in for questioning about the murder of Margaret Smith. Murderer! - You’re going back! - You killed her... Murderer! Murderer! Hon, could you answer the phone please? Hello? Hello Edwin? This is Gemma. I've been released from prison. I know. Can I see Marco? I'm begging you Edwin. Don't bother us as our lives are already at peace. I already have a new family. Edwin. The moment you bother us, you're dead. You don't know what I can do. So don't call again. Edwin, Edwin, I'm begging you. I want to see my son. Hello? Edwin? Bye! Bye Marco! Marco come here. Bye. Will you go home early? I'll try my best. Okay. - Bye! - I love you... Bye, Sir! Take care! Bye! Bye Abby. Watch the house, okay? Alright ma'am. Abby, say bye to Mommy. Marco, come on let's go! Didoy, don't forget later. I'll wait for you. - Yes, I will try my best. - Hey Didoy! Go the other way as I'll already close this. Gemma, apologies. I just got out of camp. Thanks Nando for coming here. I was worried that my telegram didn't reach you. Excuse me ma'am, excuse me sir. Can I get your orders? What's yours sir? One beer please. Alright sir. Nando, I'm sorry, I couldn't run to anyone else. It's okay Gemma, as long as it's you. I already saw Edwin and Marco. Your godchild has grown a lot. And Edwin looks wealthy now. Were you able to talk? I called the number you gave. But a girl answered so I hung up. I thought she was… But I called again and was able to talk to Edwin. He threatened me. He will kill me if I bothered them again. What's your plan? Excuse me sir. Here's your order. Excuse me. Thanks. He has a new wife and kid. From what I heard, they got wed overseas. So their marriage is invalid here? Why, do you have plans? Nando, if I try to get back with him, he'll just use what happened in Canada against me. What really happened there anyway? Sorry, I don't have any right to ask. Gemma, just return home. You won't achieve anything here. I won't go home without my son. - Happy Birthday. - Happy birthday. Thank you. Hey Mike, who's with you? Gwen. We met earlier. Enjoy! - Hello. - Hi, happy birthday, man. Thank you. Happy Birthday, man. Thank you. Mom wants me to go with her to Australia. Happy Birthday Edwin.

Enjoy your drink. Hey wait… I didn't know you had Electra complex. For your information Julian, the correct term is May-December relationship. As in younger woman, mature man. Can you imagine if I married you instead? I'll be babysitting you. I'm content with my one child, and that's Abby. - Be careful! Don't tire yourself too much. - Yes nanny. The baby's cute! What's her name? Abby. Hello Abby, how are you? She's really pretty. Where's yours? I'm not a babysitter. Sorry, I assumed. It's fine, I like kids anyway. I don't have any kids of my own. By the way, I'm Malou. I'm Rose. Are you from here? I haven't seen you around. No, I just came from a home here, who was looking for house helper. But unfortunately, they already found one. What a waste. How about you then? I'm just going to look for other jobs. Who's your boss by the way? I'm with Mr. and Mrs. Morsilla who lives nearby. The houses here are pretty big. You said it. My lady boss' room is already as big as my house in the province. That's why we hardly see each other in the house. Especially there's only a few of you. Is that so? How's your quarters? We have our own bedrooms, restrooms, and pantry. Really? You know, my former boss… He also had a big house but the maid's quarters were very small. That's why I left. Ours is big that's why we barely see each other. My male boss goes out in the morning then comes home late. My lady boss is a manager. We barely meet. I see. Really? Yeah… How many house helper do you have there? Five. That's a lot… For one kid. No, there's one more kid named Marco. He's my male boss' dead sister's child. He took the kid under his care. The kid calls my lady boss Aunt. Rose, if you have a vacancy, please contact me. Is that okay? I'll give you my contact number. Sure… Recommend me okay? - Sure… - Help me. Do you have a pen? I have… Yes, I think Neo Trade is strong enough to ignite. Positive feedback on its own. And we can very well choose control for some of our products... And open it for others, right? Arnel, could you supply all the members of the board a complete and updated list of of all our products? Yes ma'am. Meeting adjourned… Very well. We'll see you later… Yeah sure… That was pretty good meeting.. - Godfather. - Yeah? May I talk to you in my office please? Sure. Thank you… Is there any problem? Is it about Edwin? No, godfather. Well, I must admit that your father was so impressed with Edwin when he was still working with us. But when you got married, he was so worried. Since you were the only daughter, he couldn't stop you. Before he passed, he asked me to take care of you. Let's face it, I'm your only kin left. So, if there's anything bothering you, just let me know. Alright? Come in… For you ma'am. Thank you… Welcome. From Edwin… Wow! What can I say? I have to go ahead dear. Okay, thank you. Anytime! See you. Okay Hello? This is your secret admirer. You! Do you like the flowers? Of course, I love the flowers. I gave those roses so you’ll agree to have lunch with me. Good morning sir. I know you won't refuse me So what's the plan? At least 30 minutes? Sure. By the way, I told our house helper Manang Bining and Jess… To not let any stranger go into the house. Did you tell the others? Yes. Edwin, what's wrong? These past few days, you seem paranoid. Sweetheart, nowadays, you can't be too safe. You can't tell what's going to happen next. Okay. Malou, Malou… - Yes? - You have a call. Thanks! Hello? Who's this? Malou, this is Rose. Hey Rose! Hey… Rose… Sorry, the kid slept earlier a while ago. It's okay. Hello Abby! Hello! What surprise were you talking about earlier? You're looking for work right? One of my colleagues is leaving and I'd like to recommend you. But I fear you might put me to shame. Oh no Rose, you won't regret it. Please Rose… Well you do look like a nice person. I'll just tell them we're related. Really? Thank you so much! Good afternoon ma'am… Good afternoon… This is Malou, my cousin. Let's sit. Take a seat. My laundrywoman is leaving next week. I'm fine without a cook… But a laundrywoman is very important for me. Can you start now? Yes. 2500 is your starting pay. If you're good, I'll give you an increase after three months. I'll do my best. Alright, since you're Rose's cousin… I'm not going to ask verification documents anymore. But Rose will be liable for you. You don’t have to worry, ma'am. I'll go ahead okay? Thanks. Thank you ma'am. There, you got hired! Thanks Rose. You know… You sound like Sharon. Really? Yes, when she has asthma. You bad kid. So you're Malou? - Yes. - This polo shirt is imported… Take care of it because Sir is sensitive. Do you see this? You can't afford this. This one is expensive! Edwin, there are people around. Dude, you're an embarrassment she says. Come on Gemma. Dude, one more. My wife is leaving. She's going to Canada, just give me dollar bills. You're dead later… Edwin, what are you doing? Good thing the girl is helping. She should. She's a nurse after all. What's she going to do here, get pregnant over and over? She should work. Your husband is shameless when drunk. They're just having fun. Why are you crying? Are you really going? Did you think well about it? You just live in hiding there. Why do you want to eat there anyway? You don't eat with us. I'm fine eating there. Or are you embarrassed? You'd rather stay in the room. Don't be. Treat this as your home. Here she is. Malou, come and eat here. - I still have lots to do. - How about ma'am? Asleep. She'll most likely wake up Saturday noon. Didoy, give this to the guard. You're already getting on this early? So what? Aren't you used to it yet? They've always been clingy like that. Take the biggest piece of fish, it's really for you. Don't hold back eating breakfast okay? Manang. Good morning. Good morning sir. You startled us sir. You're up early. I'm going to Cebu and my flight is at 8AM. How long will you be away? Three days. Breakfast sir? I'll have one during flight instead. I'll just reiterate, no MSG in my food, as I got dizzy with your vegetable dish yesterday. Sorry sir, I'll remember that. It will never happen again. Okay… Take care sir! Sir, bye! I'll tell Didoy on you. You're just envious. It's obvious you like sir. Stop it. Too early for that. Marco, my son… You're playing ball. - Okay - Let's play. Catch the ball okay? You're good! Really good! Do you want to be a basketball player in the future? I want to be a pilot. - You want to fly planes? - Yes! - Really? - Yes. Don't you remember me? No. No? Look at me closely… See if you remember me. I'm going to give you something. Okay. Just play more okay? Wait a bit son… Do you remember this? This was your favorite when you were still small. Look….

Where have you been again? When you play, I need to see where you are. You always tire me kid. What really is your plan? I need to get him out of that place. Why don't you talk to Edwin? Plead to him. He might agree. I already did, remember? I called him and he won't give the kid to me. He'll kill me if I took our child. He's really changed. Do you still love him? I don't know anymore what that means. I just need my son back. Me, I still love you. I can't get you out of my thoughts. I can't get myself to love Marietta. Becaue you're the one I really love. But now that you're back… I wan to prove my love to you. Let's get together Gemma. As long as I don't have my son yet… I will remain numb to love. Let's talk about that some other time Nando. Help me get my son first. Malou, I already cleaned the bathroom. You take care of the rest okay? Get in. You wanted to marry… what's your name? Gemma. Do you like each other? Yes. To prove your marriage, kiss each other. Good. Sign here. By the power vested in me, I declare you husband and wife. - Congratulations! - Thank you judge. Congratulations! Congratulations Edwin! Congratulations! Thanks Emily. Didn't I tell you not to bathe there alone?! This kid really… If something happens to you kid, I'm dead. Come out of there Marco and go here. This kid really… Come on, enough of that. Put on clothes quickly. Oh, Oh! What did you do to me? Come over here! You got me wet! Come here! Get up! You're so annoying! Look, I'm all wet. - Why?

You're dripping wet. I'll take care of him. Okay, that's probably better! Such a pest! There, good! Where's the lizard? Where? Hi hon. I knew it, my baby is still awake. What took you so long? I'm sorry. My flight was delayed for two hours from Cebu. You know how our domestic flights are. Do that later. I missed you. Edwin, you are taking good care of Sports World, right? Of course, that's why I went to Cebu. I plan to start a branch there. Why don't I join you in your business trips? So I know what's happening to the company. Cindy, you're already managing two companies. Leave Sports World to me. Even when your dad was still alive… I've been managing that area. So, the company doesn't have a problem? If there was, it's not your problem anymore. Hon, that's also my problem… Dad handed those companies for my care before he passed… You don't trust me? Your dad also handed you in my care and I took care of you, right? There's a casino in Cebu right? I think so, maybe… You don't gamble? Cindy, I don't know how to gamble. You don't play baccarat? Baccarat? What baccarat? Edwin, please don't lie to me. I told you, I don't gamble. You're irritating! - Somebody told me that they saw you… - What? What?! That you lose a lot in gambling… What?! Are you using the company's money? What did you say? - So, it's true! - You believe them more than me? How dare you use company money! Edwin, you're hurting me… - And now you're accusing me? - How dare you Edwin! What are you trying to say? What are you trying to say? That I'm not feeding the family?! All you do is go out with your friends! You don't want to work! Don't talk to me like that! - You're an animal! Animal! - I'm not irresponsible. You don't have the right to say that to me. What?

I was terminated from work… - What? - Are you deaf?! Isn't that your third in six months Edwin? Gemma I know how to count! So where are we getting food now? Are we borrowing from your mom again? You talk too much! I wasn't happy where I was working! Try to work so you would know… Get work so you can help me… Alright, I'll get work. I did finish a degree in Nursing.

You have no say in my life. You have no say at all. Look Cindy, I'm only concerned about you. If I want your concern, I'll ask for it.… Now, get out of my office, and get out of my life! Edwin what's this? This is why you forced me to marry you in Hongkong... Because you already have a wife here. Stop it Cindy. Why can't you explain yourself? Face me and explain this! - What?! - Enough! Okay?! Whoever gave you that is just trying to ruin me! And you're so stupid to believe it! Don't fool with me! - You're lying to me! - You stop! - You're lying to me! You're shameless! - You don't want to stop? - You're an animal! Animal! - Enough - Animal! You're such a liar! - Shut up! - How dare you do this to me! - Shut up! Shut up! How dare you Edwin! Go to your room! Go to your room! And you? You don't want to stop? Don't hurt the kid! Don't ever come out! Stay there! You want to fight? You want to fight? No… - What do you want? - I just want the truth… Edwin, what are you? You're an animal! What? Is this what you want? Marco? What liar? I am not lying to you! Because you're playing with me… Where are you going? If you go out, you will get it! Stay there! Marco… Son… - What happened to you? - Nanny! Were you hurt? Were you? Gemma, what's up? I will kill him! I will kill that animal! Let's go there… God forgive me. I hope he dies! If only I had a gun, I would have shot his head! What happened? He has no heart for my son… The kid was helpless… He even hurts women… Like what he did to me before… He's really a demon! Demon! Gemma, come away with me. I will take you far from all this. I will give you a good life. I won't have peace without my son. I'm begging you Nando… Help me. If I get Marco, I will go with you anywhere. You really… I heard Mrs. Villa's son is also your lover. Marco, Marco! Nanny! Come here Marco. We'll go there okay? Where? Hey Malou, Malou, Malou! What are you doing? Where are you bringing the kid? He was going to pee, right? What? Are you stupid? What do you think of the kid? A dog? The restroom is over there! Can't you see that? There! Let me have him! Come here, you're really a bother! I'll cut that organ of yours. What's this? So are you leaving him? I heard that… I'm still confused. It's not that easy… I'm considering a lot of things… Well, you know what! This time just don't use your heart, okay? You know how unreliable that is. Hey baby! Look out! Wow! Edwin! Marco! Auntie. Hi! Edwin… Abby. Abby, mommy! Hi my baby! - I missed you. Wait. - Cindy, Cindy! Auntie. Hi Marco! Big horse! You look so cute! What the hell? Look Abby a balloon... I'm sorry… A lot right? Abby, do you want to ride a horse? I'm sorry. Abby, look! Daddy has lots of balloons. Where did the marriage certificate come from? You should've thought that was a fake. Your former wife was already dead… Two years into marriage… When she had pregnancy complications. She died on the operating table. Our child didn't make it either. It was premature. Why didn't you tell me before? What would I do? What will I give you that you don't have yet? You have everything… That's why I was afraid. Our age gap is too big… If I told you I was a widower… You may have lost interest in me. I hope you can forgive me. I forgot. It's never going to happen again. I will do nothing but love you from now on… Just give our marriage a second chance. For Abby as well… Why are you laughing when I'm this serious? I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. You just look so silly in that costume. And I don't know how to take you seriously. I'm sorry. What's important was I made you laugh. Well if you were willing to be embarrassed just to be forgiven… What else can I do? There is something else… What? What would you say if we spend some time together? Just the two of us in Hongkong? -What's happening? - You kill her. Murderer! Marco! Malou! You're having a nightmare. Have a drink. If there's something bothering you, tell me so you can feel better. We're already like family. I have a secret… What? I killed a child. What? I was a... nurse in Canada… Then? I had a girl patient. She had cancer. She was left alone by her parents. I put something in her dextrose. Did you make a mistake? I meant to. I killed her. My God. I just wanted to end the girl's suffering. I took pity on her. Until I got jailed. After two years, I was freed. They thought I only made a mistake. Due to overwork. But the truth is… I killed her out of pity. The girl was so helpless… I felt pity on her… Don't blame yourself too much. If I were in your place, I may have done the same thing. Keep this between us. Yes, only between us... you can count on it. Get some rest okay? Lie down… They're doing another honeymoon. Of course! Jess, Jess! Is this complete? How many bags? One, two, three… Okay? Jess, while we're away, don't let anyone in okay? Yes sir. Madame, we'll be in HongKong for a week. Take care of the house. - Be a good girl. - Yes ma'am. Don't forget the kids okay? - We won't forget to bring back goodies. - Thank you ma'am. Bye! Alright. - Bye bye ma'am - Bye! Myrna! Come here. Whatever you saw… I'll explain some other time… You won't understand it now… Wait, wait… Here, here… If that's not enough, I'll add more on payday. I'm begging you… Don't say a thing. I am begging you… Please… Myrna. That's why you and Marco look alike. Look… Even the eyes, mouth… Malou, your life is so colorful. Like a movie. Rose… Are we still friends? Despite knowing the truth? Of course, what do you think of me, two-faced? But I wish you didn't lie to me. Sorry Rose… That time… I don't know who I can treat as friend or enemy. I hope you understand… My son's life depends on this. If someone knows about this secret. You shouldn't have kept it secret so I understood your actions. Will Myrna tell on me? That lunatic? Don't worry, I have aces up my sleeve against her. So… Are you helping me get Marco out? Of course. If a stranger like me wanted to do it myself… I wanted to help him. Because I feel pity on him. What more with you, his real mom? Rose... Thanks for understanding. Thank you. Stop crying now… Nanny, where are we going? We're taking a walk. Aren't we Rose? Yes. Wait. Wait a bit. Come on… Nanny, where are we really going? Jess woke up. Now what? Come… Are we going back? Nanny, why? Hey, what are you doing? Don't be noisy. What happened? Because I'm going to take my son with me, Myrna. What? Are you going to help? Don't care. You do it. Wait, Myrna, Myrna… I'll also take care of telling ma'am why her perfume and lipstick really vanishes… You! What am I going to do anyway? Flirt with Jess and move him away from the gate. What? He's not even my type. Hold on Myrna. I beg you. Shouldn't Glo be doing that? Are you nuts? She's an enemy here. What? What? Fine. But make it fast okay? I can't stomach what I'm about to do so make it quick. Yes, thank you. Nanny, why? Wait. Stay here and wait for my signal. Hi Jess… Oh, Myrna, what are you doing? It's so hot in our room. Look I'm sweating. Yes, you are. Looks like you're sweating too. No. Let's go there first. That's a good idea. Come and let's talk there… Come on, faster! Why was there a honk? What was that? Jess, oh my Jess! - What the heck! - Hey, get out of there! You woman! Come down here! - It's Glo, my goodness… - And Didoy, get out of there. You really are shameless! You just do it anywhere! Why are you meddling? I'm not a flirt. So why were you flirting with Jess? What's going to happen to you now? Too horny. I will tell you guys on sir. Jess, get those two inside. You don't have any shame. Go inside! What are we going to do? Get off me! You'll get yours one day! Glo you're really a trouble-maker. - Flirt. - Much flirty than me. Maniac. You're the maniac, I told you hands off! What? I don't think we can do this tonight. Jess is so alive already. If it weren't for Glo… such a flirt! What? Wait, Malou… Nando is waiting outside. - Don't worry, we can try again. - Nanny, aren't we going out anymore? Bring Marco to his room first so they don't notice. There will be a next time. Myrna… Thanks for the help. Don't worry, we'll try again. Go to sleep okay? My God! There might be a storm! There's a lot of rain. Myrna, please close all of the windows in the living room. - Yes ma'am. - Let's eat. Rose, you go upstairs. Malou, why aren't you eating? Stop it, not there! I'm ticklish there. Hey! What are you doing?! You're shameless! Get out of here! I will tell ma'am that you were using her bathroom! It's Glo's fault! Ma'am! Ma'am! But it's true! You forced me here. It wasn't just me! I'll tell on both of you Didoy! You're both shameless. You'll see. You're always a meddler. Why don't you just get your own boyfriend?! Glo, don't bring your flirting here! Oh really? Who's more of a flirt then, huh? What?! You're more flirty! Mind your business! - Help me! - Stop meddling with my life! Hey, come here! Abby... Ready yourself woman. We're not done yet! You should be the one preparing. Because I will tell ma'am everything you've been doing in this house. Get out of there! Go and tell on me! Ma'am! The kid! Are you still telling?! Let me through! Ma'am! What was that? Upstairs! Ma'am! The kid! Stop it! Glo, that's enough. Stop! Malou, the kid has a wound. What are we going to do? We need to bring her to the hospital! There's a doctor… Jess! Jess, quickly! Go and grab Marco! What happened here? Abby! Abby! Oh baby… Malou, thank you very much! For saving my child. Your sir and I we're rushing… Home when we found out. Ma'am Bining told us all that happened. Glo is in the hospital… When she recovers, she will end up in jail. Dr. Franco also said that if you hadn't done first aid… She would've experienced shock from blood loss. Ma'am I remembered that her wound was too deep… So she might still be dizzy right now… No, no. She's fine now. You're okay baby right? Thank you… Abby, I promise, mommy won't leave you anymore. Honey, honey, look she's okay, she's fine! Say thank you to Malou. She saved Abby. Go ahead, say thank you! - Abby, say hi to Dr. Franco. - Hi! Look, she's okay, thank you Doc, thank you so much. I know you were going to kill or have me killed! I want you know that Nando and my cousins know that I'm here. What are you doing in my house? Starting trouble? - They're going to put you in jail! - You know what I'm doing in your house? Give me back my son. He has no future with you! We're doing fine. You are doing fine, but not Marco. No one loves him and you didn't even tell them he's your son! - What kind of father are you? - How about you? What kind of mother are you? You abandoned us Gemma! You even killed a child, you're not thinking right. So how will you take care of Marco? That's not true! You know that! You couldn't get a job that's why I went overseas… Whatever happened in Canada, is not enough reason to take Marco from me! And not tell him I'm his mom! Edwin, I will only say this… Even if you kill me, I won't leave without Marco. Go ahead and get the boy. I will just say he was kidnapped. I'll just make up a story. Thank you even though I shouldn't… Because I'm just taking what's mine… Quick, quick! So you'll take care of this? - Yes. - Take care alright? Yes. Are you sure nothing bad will happen to you? That's what sir said? That's what we agreed on. Where are you going? Don't. It's better if we don't know. Whatever happens, we don't know anything. Go while ma'am is still sleeping. Thanks. Thank you so much. Quickly! Who are you? I'm your Uncle Nando. - Godfather? - I'll explain later okay? Come here quickly! Make sure to kill them both except the kid. Yes boss. Where are we going nanny? We're going to your real home. Yes. Be careful with the kid. Nanny! Edwin set us up! - What are we going to do? - You and Marco duck as you might get hit. Duck! The magazine! Duck! - Make a call! - There! Approaching Avenida, requesting for back-up. Quickly, get off! Nanny! You might hit the kid, chase them! Go around! There, there! Let's stay here. - Quickly! - Get off! You'll be late for class! Our house is like a rat cave. I dislike it! Why are you in a hurry? Didn't we agreed to live in Alabang village? - Give that to me! - That's mine! Yes, yes. Nando, it won't open. Let me. If I didn't tell… I'm handsome anyway! Handsome? I'll hit you if… It's locked Nando. What are we going to do? Let's find another exit. Out of the way! Excuse me. Jo, over here. Excuse me, PPN News. Excuse me, PPN News. What's happening?

Hey, you have a visitor. Hey! You have a visitor! What is your grandchild's case? I will see what I can do. Here you go ma'am. Thanks! Take a seat. That's our problem in the house. We don't have other relatives. Why did you do that? Why did you kidnap Marco? I trusted you. I let you live in my house. Why, Malou? Am I not paying you enough? I don't need money… I'm getting my son back. Which son? Marco is my son. He's not really Edwin's sister's kid. I'm the legal wife of your spouse right now. That's not true! You're just wrecking my family! So you can save yourself. But this I will tell you… I assure you will rot in jail! Is that all your influence can do? Money? You're a waste. Educated but stupid. You're pitiful. Get out, I don't need you. Our guest today is Mrs. Gemma Morcilla. She is known as Malou in her work. She was accussed of kidnapping by her boss recetly.
