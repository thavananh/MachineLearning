[ Rain falling ] [ Indistinct shouting in distance ] [ Dogs growling, barking ] MAN: We found something! Over here! Meg?! Meg! Meg! MAN: Oh, my God. [ Alarm clock blares ] [ Alarm clock stops ] [ Sighs ] You have to get up. I got to go to work. What time is it? Early. I don't really have anything for breakfast. Coffee? Yeah, that was on the list, too. Can I drop you somewhere? [ Scoffs ] You're not kidding, huh? Where do you have to be? You know the art college? [ Spits, water runs ] It's on Bakersfield? Yeah, where's that? By the new Home Depot. Yeah. Yeah, sure, okay. I know the place. Look, if it's out of the way... No, no, it's fine. It's fine. So, what are you studying? Graphic design. Here. I did this. Hmm. But I might switch to web design. I love the Internet and shit. The whole programming thing is totally sick. How old are you? 22. Yeah? Well, maybe 20? You looked older in the bar. Yeah, I get that all the time. How old are you? You don't want to know. Don't worry. My dad's 50. Great. He says he's living his second youth or something. Does he, now? So, what do you do? Security. You, like, a bouncer? [ Scoffs ] Don't tell me I just slept with a security guard. [ Laughs ] I'm not saying anything. [ Chuckles dryly ] Sir, I am just trying to explain the situation to you. I should never have let your driver enter in the first place. The man was late. Oh, hey, Dave. Hey. Listen, I was thinking about something. Yeah? If it's too much, you just tell me, okay? You tell me right to my face 'cause I can take that. What is it? Well, I was thinking about the schedule. Well, spit it out. You think you can take my shift Christmas Eve? I mean, I know you're doing Christmas Day and all already, but if you could take my night shift, then I can go and have a real good one with my family. It's about the little ones, you know? That's fine. I'll make it up to you. No need. Seriously, Dave, you tell me to eff off, I will eff off right now. Reg, eff off. I'll do it. You sure? Yeah, it's just another day, right? Thanks, man. He missed the window. The other driver left. You know, you're making my wife very happy. Consider it my Christmas gift to you. I will let her know. Look, the bottom line is your driver was lost. He is at fault. What are you gonna do about it? This is gonna be a long day, boys. [ Laughter ] Okay. You know, I envy you. What do you envy about me? Well, a young coed every night. Oh, don't read too much into it. I'm the one who should envy you. It gets old, you know. [ Laughing ] You might want to keep that to yourself. [ Laughs ] Hey, Ed, what have we got today? The usual. Right on. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh, hey ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh ♪ 6-1-8. Check. 2-5-5. Check. All right. Good night, guys. 3-1-7. Check. Do you want to go for beers later, Dale? Can't. I'm meeting with the mortgage broker. Slave to the bank. We're all slaves, Phil. Get you a good rate? No. It's a good news/bad news meeting. Right. See you tomorrow, guys. I pray for you, brother. Good luck. All right, Dale. He's getting burned. [ Laughs ] 2-1-6. Check. Uh, no. Hold on. I don't have an out time on that truck. Fuck it. Who signed for it? Dale. That's fine. We got a supervisor's signature. Hey, Dale! He's halfway to his car. Don't worry about it. Let me see that. Right there. There's no exit time for the foreign truck driver. Yeah, well, Dale probably felt he didn't need one. Yeah, or he wanted to go home early. It's not a DMZ checkpoint. [ Laughs ] Is the driver still here? What's he gonna do, huh? Get Dale fired for letting him on in the first place? There's still a truck out there. It might not be the truck you need. Don't know. Your call. Where? Good luck! So, how was the game that I missed? Oh, man, so get this. I've got jack-queen, suited, in the big blind, right? Yeah. Bunch of limpers, I make the min raise. Homey under the gun smooth-calls me. Okay. Well, the flop comes down king-king-9, right? No shit? Yeah, so I got the, uh, gutshot straight draw and a back-door flush draw. Right. I bet the pot, you know, thinking to take it down right there. Homeboy smooth-calls me again, so automatically I put him on a king, but I catch the 10 on the turn, so I got the straight, right? Yeah. Red 4 on the river. Nice. I force him all-in. He calls me. Fucking donkey was playing king-4, offsuit, under the gun to a raise. Fuck me! Unbelievable. Yeah, that's the one. Um, I guess we'll go down to the cab, talk to the driver. [ Clears throat ] Hey, Dave, there's no one here. Do you know how foreign this guy was? I never saw him. Well, is he Asian or Middle Eastern or...? What are you, deaf? I told you I never saw him. I don't know. [ Chuckles ] I thought you might know. I'll go around the building and check in the cafeteria. That's fine. Hey, what are you doing back there? Come on out. Now, please. [ Speaking Serbian ] Oh, great. Come on. Come on out here. What's your name? Your name? ¿Nombre? Huh? Anja. Anja. You speak English, Anja? Because I don't speak your language. [ Speaking Serbian ] It's-- it's okay. It's all right, okay? See? Where you from? Do you-- Do you have any papers? Identification? Uh-- Uh, papers? A passport. You got a passport? You got a passport? This is you. [ Speaking Serbian ] Sister? That's your sister? [ Speaking Serbian ] Look, I don't understand you. [ Speaking Serbian ] Just slow down, okay? "Slow down," like that's gonna help. [ Speaking Serbian ] The truck? You were in the truck? Okay, thank you. Just stay right there. You just stay over there, okay? Stay there, stay there. [ Speaking Serbian ] Stay right there, please. [ Speaking Serbian ] Don't come any closer, okay? I can't let you stay here. Look... I can take you to a women's shelter, okay? [ Man speaking Russian ] Run! Get out of here! Go! [ Groans ] [ Alarm blaring ] [ Gunshot ] [ David breathing heavily ] [ Monitor beeping ] Meg? Oh, my God. Look at you. You've grown so much. Isn't that what's supposed to happen? Yeah. Yeah, I guess. I guess so. It's been a really long time. I know. You look tired. Not my best day. Mom says that's been your excuse for your entire life. [ Door opens ] DR. ERNHART: Wakey, wakey. How many fingers am I holding up? DAVID: Four. Feeling light-headed? Sort of. How's your chest? It's sore. Hurt to breathe? [ David sighs ] Only when I try to breathe deeply. This should help. What hospital am I at? No, no-- [ Sighs ] You have to rest. Wha-- No... What's going on? Where's Dale? Shh! You need to heal. You have the best care available. [ Door opens, closes ] This is what you do! It's what you do for a living! You can't even protect your own daughter! Can you see me? I've got someone who wants to talk with you. [ Elevator bell dings ] [ Whistling "Good King Wenceslas" ] [ Door closes ] Nice to finally meet you. Apparently, you've been out for days. That long? Time flies, David. [ Clears throat ] Uh, what is this place? You're in private care, courtesy of the Stross Corporation. Uh, where's-- where's my phone and wallet? Your things are safe. This is a statement for you to sign. It releases you of criminal responsibility. For self-defense? Just sign on the bottom. If you don't mind, I'd like to read it. I prepared it for you. It's in your best interests. I'm not gonna sign anything without reading it first. Okay, then I'll paraphrase it for you. By signing, you are not criminally responsible. How's that? There's no mention of the girl. What girl? Anja. She led me to the bodies. What bodies? The truck was empty. No, the truck wasn't empty. Your statement says it was empty. What are you doing? Not criminally responsible. Who investigated this? We did. Well, they are hiding the facts. Well... if you want me to write that down, I'll write that down. How many bodies did you say? How many bodies? Reg would have seen them. Mr. Winters' statement doesn't mention bodies. The investigating officer's report doesn't mention bodies. Your supervisor's report doesn't mention bodies. Only you do. You do realize this might be a side effect-- Oh, come on, it is not a side effect. These drugs are very powerful. Anja led me to the bodies. Whatever anyone else says is a lie. Interesting. If you want me to pass on the information, I will, but I don't think it'll do your career any good. I'm not signing this. I've heard you've had a history of being sympathetic to un-American groups. Oh, don't go there. While stationed in Iraq-- I did what was right. You testified against your own men. Civilians were killed. So you say. I was there. So, what side are you on? Is that a threat? No, it's a simple question. It cost you your job over there in private security. I had a moral obligation. And yet no one was found criminally responsible-- and I'm sorry to bring this up-- in the same way that no one was found criminally responsible in regards to your daughter. So what does this pattern of your so-called moral obligation prove? Who are you? I'm your lawyer. Fuck you. I'm on your side. Is the company bringing in the girls? You're making things complicated. What, you want me to lie for you? That's not my intention. I know what I saw. I'm gonna give you a moment to think about it. This can be very easy, David, for everyone. Where did Anja go? I have no idea what you're talking about. How do you sleep at night? I hope you wake up. [ Line ringing ] I think we might have reached that scenario we talked about. Are you sure? Yeah. You know that once we commit... [ Groans ] I know. When do you need us? [ Whistling "Good King Wenceslas" ] [Whistling continues] This pen doesn't work. Try harder. I did. [ Breathing heavily ] [ Door closes ] [ Dialing, cellphone rings ] Hello? Reg. David? What the fuck happened? You didn't sign the form, man. What happened to the girl? You're screwed, and I can't talk-- Don't hang up on me! I can't, David. They're calling you a terrorist. I'm sorry. Reg! [ Thud ] He seemed gentle. Otherwise, I wouldn't have let him up. [ Sniffles ] But as soon as he realized that we were alone, that's when everything changed. [ Crying ] He had a knife. He carried it on him, and he put it at my throat. I was so afraid. I just closed my eyes and let him do whatever he wanted. I just-- I just feel so stupid, and... I felt so powerless, you know? This is supposed to be an emotionally safe place. Yeah, uh, I'm-- I'm sorry. Are you-- Are you Monika Priese? More police harassment? No. No, I'm-- I'm not a cop. I'm looking for a girl. Uh, I think she was Serbian. Are you kidding me? So, do you have lists of, uh, women who've come to you for help sometime in the last few days? Well, then you should call during work hours and make an appointment. This girl can't wait that long. Follow me. [ Door opens, closes ] It's a big place. Yeah. I'm grateful to the Baptist Church. They've been supporting the shelter for years. So what's this about a Serbian girl? [ David clears throat ] Uh... Two sisters were shipped here illegally. One, I think, got sick and was killed. The other one ran off. I was hoping she made it to you for help. Her name is Anja. Yeah. So what are you gonna do? I want to help. Why? Let's just say that I want to help this girl, and if that extends to helping your organization, then-- then we both win. What my organization needs is more money, not more testosterone. Miss Priese... I'd-- I'd really like to start over. My name is David. I have this. It was my daughter. She was, uh, raped five years ago. Oh, I'm so sorry. If I can stop this from happening to... girls like Meg... She was beautiful. Yeah, thank you. She got it from her mother. In fact, my wife, uh-- uh, my ex-wife, uh, came to you right after it happened. Uh, there was a victim support group that your organization had. That's, uh, that's how I heard about you. Well, your daughter must be proud of you. I hope so. So, uh, how can I help you? Did Anja come to you? No, I'm afraid not. Then could you possibly put me in contact with any other trafficked-women survivors, anyone that could lead me to those responsible? Yeah, I know someone. [ Speaking Russian ] [ Russian ] There's no work in her country, so gangs take advantage of them. [ Speaking Russian ] She was promised all she would have to do is dance in a club. [ Vika speaking Russian ] [ Russian ] They took away her passport and her visa, and they shipped her in a container to America. [ Vika speaking Russian ] Girls that complain were taken away and never seen again. [ Vika speaking Russian ] Once here, they're stripped naked and sold in underground markets. [ Russian ] She was raped. [ Vika speaking Russian ] She was raped by johns even though she asked for help. W-Wait a second. The johns knew that she was a prisoner? VIKA: They don't care. They want to have sex, so they have sex. They want to have sex everywhere. Why didn't you try to escape? I'm given heroin so I don't run away. I'm hungry, I'm weak. And they say if I run, they kill me and they kill my family, too. How did you get out? One day, a man come to have sex, but-- but he didn't. Instead, he gave me a card for woman's shelter, so that night, I run, and I call Monika. Do the police know her story? No. No, if they did, they'd deport her, and then the people that sold her would kill her. Do you think that Anja could be there? I do not know. It's the only place I know that brings trafficked girls from Eastern Europe. Where is it? They have money, and they know very many people. I just need to know where to find them. You need... You need someone to make introduction. What about you? MONIKA: No. She's not going back. If they recognize her... You promise. You promise you're gonna stop men. Yes. VIKA: Okay. Okay, I'll go. I'll go. Do what I say. [ "Silent Night" playing ] [ Speaking Russian ] [ Speaking Russian ] Mm-hmm. Is there a problem? He doesn't like the look of you. Mm-hmm. [ Sighs ] You're on your own. [ Door opens ] [ Speaking Russian] [ Door closes ] Hey, you, you. Hey, what you want? What do you want? Blonde? Red hair? Big tits? Anal? Ass to mouth? Anything! Yeah? Uh... I'd just, you know, like to see what else you got. You're living a dream, my friend. This is where dreams come true. Follow me, follow me. So, who told you about us? I hear things. Ah, what sort? [ Man speaking Russian ] Well, you know, this is the place that I want. Hmm, cryptic man leads cryptic life, huh? I don't like complications. Okay, so you listen to the wind. Absolutely. Did the wind mention the price? No? For you, $200. Comrade, that seems a little steep. Hey, comrade, it can stop right here. This ain't no fish-fucking-market. Huh? Hmm? Yeah, zuzeh zuzeh zuzeh zuzeh. Thank you. Follow me. [ Girls moaning ] [ Girls whimpering ] [ Man grunting ] So, did you see what you want? Not yet. I know what you need. You won't be disappointed. Step inside. Do what you will. DAVID: Do you speak English? Do you have a name? [ Speaking Serbian ] No, no, lea-- You don't have to do that. Are you sick? No, please. Please, get up. You don't have to do that, okay? I'm not gonna hurt you, all right? I'm not gonna hurt you. You know you have a fever. [ Speaking Serbian ] Did they do this to you? Blow job? No, no. I just want to look at your arms, okay? [ Speaking Serbian ] Your ring? No. No, no, I'm-- I'm not gonna take your ring, okay? I want to see your arms. All right? I just want to look at your arms. Can I do that? Okay. Those men. Those men upstairs. Did they-- Did they make you come here? Look, I'm-- I'm-- I'm not gonna force you to do anything, okay? I'm-- I'm not gonna force you to do anything. Do you know a Serbian girl named Anja? Anja? Da. You know Anja? [ Speaking Serbian ] You know Anja, and Anja is here? [ Door opens ] MAN: Is there a problem? There's no problem. Why are you here? I don't know what you're talking about. As soon as you cross my threshold, you're in my world. I ask you a question, you better answer. Look, man, I gave you my money, huh? MAN: You fucked up. All right, look, just-- Just take it easy. I don't want any trouble. Who are you? [ Speaking Russian ] Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey, the girl had nothing to do with this! [ Shouting continues, door closes ] Look, just be cool, all right? Just be cool, man. I'm gonna-- Aah! [ Shouting, grunting ] [ Speaking Russian ] [ Men speaking Russian ] [ Shouting continues ] [ Buzzing ] [ Beep ] [ Foghorn blows ] [ Vehicle stops ] I should not be here. Yeah. Yeah, I know, man. Thanks. What do you hear? To mind my own business. That's what I hear. There was a statement written for me that I'd sign or I'd lose my job. Who told you that? Dale told me that. It's a shit storm, Dave. They questioned me for hours about that truck. There was a Serbian girl in the sleeper. What'd you hear about her? Nothing. I didn't hear anything about her. The truck's cargo was trafficked girls. They were dead. They got sick-- TB, I don't-- I don't know. I think they shot them. One of them was this girl's sister. That was Dale signed off on that. Yeah, I know. He has been signing off on an early morning truck transfer every week, before anybody gets into the office. For how long? I don't know how long. I saw this in the logbook last month. Who's the shipper? It-- It's a Russian name. I don't know. What did you hear about me? Oh, like, a big bullshit story about you've been involved in some breach of Homeland Security, you're terrorist of some kind. That vague? It is that vague! You got to wake up, Dave. This is all they need. They told us to come to the Feds if we even heard from you. They came in, they talked to Dale and confiscated every goddamn thing in your locker! You sure they were Feds? No, I don't know if it was the Feds or not. It's two guys come in-- they're white guys, they're in suits. I don't know what's being said 'cause they're over there, and they're talking with Phillip. So what are you gonna do? I got to find the girl who's gonna back up my story. Then you need this, man. [ Gun cocks ] All right. Find out whatever you can about the owner of that shipment. And find me that logbook. That's the only evidence I got-- [ Gunshot ] [ Car horn blaring ] Reg! [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots ] [ Horn honks ] Get the fuck out of the car right now! Go! [ Engine revs ] [ Gunshots ] [ Tires squeal ] [ Gasps ] Don't make a sound. Is there anyone else here? Cleaning staff? Anyone expecting you around here tonight? All right, this way. Is anyone gonna call? I need to know that I can trust you. Can I do that? Did I hurt you? Did you talk to anyone else about me? Anybody come around asking questions? Get out. You heard me. But, please, wait a minute. "Wait a minute"? You had a gun to my head. I'm on your side. How is this for me? [ David grunts ] I didn't have a choice. What did you do? I'm trying to find Anja. [ Grunts, breathing heavily ] Any chance you have a first-aid kit? Yeah. Yeah, I do. DAVID: Thank you. I didn't have anywhere else to, uh... You seemed to be the safest bet. Safe from what? They killed my friend. You need to quit. I can't. Look at you. You didn't see Anja. I know the girls. She, uh... She looked at me with these eyes, exactly the same way my daughter used to. They're not gonna be lenient on you. I'm not looking for sympathy. You need to wash that. Ooh. This is gonna sting. It already does. Yeah. Why don't you let the police take care of this? Okay. If you could just let me rest for about 20 minutes, then I'll leave. You are in no shape to go anywhere in 20 minutes. Well, I can't stay here. So, where are you gonna go? God, I've been trying to save people my entire life, much to my parents' chagrin. Listen, there's a room here you can use. People have stayed there before. The sooner I leave, the better for you. Listen, I've had junkies and battered wives stay at my house. I've had husbands and boyfriends and pimps fight out on my lawn. I know what I'm doing. And you need rest. You don't know me. I could say the same thing about you. Sleep. So why do all this? You're not married. You give all your time to your cause. What's in this for you? My best friend's father was an abusive alcoholic. She never made it to 14. [ Sighs ] Coffee? I thought you might need some legal advice. I found her card in your pocket. Did you come alone? I'm usually one-on-one with my clients-- Just answer my fucking question. Did you come alone? Yes, she did. Does that make it better, David? Could you give us a moment, please? Yeah, sure. She's a nice girl. A bit young for you, but-- Cut to the chase. Well, isn't it obvious? You should have signed the statement. Who do you work for? We've been through this. And you haven't given me any answers. It's not about me. I could kill you right now. It wouldn't help your case much, would it? Oh, my case? [ Laughs ] My case! What case? No matter what I do, no matter what I say, I'm crucified. You told the Feds I'm a terrorist. Well, history is history, and the evidence is there in your past. If I go down, I'm dragging you with me. Ay, ay. So, what did you tell Monika? Not enough, obviously. Did you talk about the Stross Corporation? If I had, do you think she would have called you? Who have you talked to? Did you have Reg killed? Who have you talked to, David? You killed him, didn't you? Sure you don't want a coffee? You're a cold-hearted bitch. Well, I need another one. Can't twist your arm? [ Door closes ] Well? Thank you. You did the right thing. What happens now? We end this through the proper channels. Is he in trouble? I can't comment on that. [ Grunts ] MONIKA: What's his story? DANIELLE: My job is not to determine the truth. My job is to figure out the best legal options for him. Oh, are you gonna charge him? You could. He just needed my help. You sure about that? I mean, what exactly did he say to you? MONIKA: Not much. DANIELLE: Like what? Aah! Unh! Merry Christmas, David. I do hope that you're not afraid of the dark. BILLIE: What kind of father forgets his daughter? [ Cries ] [ Engine stops ] [ Whistles ] Wakey, wakey, sunshine. Brought you to a special place. Someone wants to see you. I would, uh, tell you who, but they like their anonymity. Here... let me help you. Don't worry, this will all be over soon. Aah! Aah! [ Both grunting ] Aah! [ Groans ] [ Grunting ] [ Panting ] [ Girls' screams echoing ] [ Cellphone keys beeping ] [ Door opens ] [ Sighs ] I didn't think I'd see you again. Well, life is full of surprises. Shit, you're looking rough. What the fuck happened to you? Oh, it's, um... It's a long story. I, uh... Can-- Can you tell me where-- where an e-mail came from? I think it tells you in the address bar. No, I need-- I need to be able to locate and track servers. Oh, you mean like mail routing? Yeah. Can you do that with a cellphone? My girlfriend can. She'll do this? She'll do anything for me. It's just down here. Hey, babe. This is my cousin. How you going, cuz? It's nice to meet you. Everybody's got some, uh, crazy family, eh? SAM: David needs a little help. It looks like you were in a fight and lost. Yeah. Uh, can you trace e-mail servers? Are you shitting me? What can't I do? Cellular. Hmm... Problem? No, not a problem, but, um, it will take longer. You're not in a rush, are you? Where did you get this? From a friend. Right, "a friend." I got it. I won't ask. I need to know where the e-mails are coming from and going to. So, what are you, some spy guy? [ Scoffs ] No. Really? You act like a spy guy. Oh, do I? Hey, in my world, that's a big compliment. He's a security guard. [ Laughs ] Hey, whatever. It's all good. [ Computer beeps ] Shit! This is a private server. Private? Yeah, as in governments use private servers, or big-ass corporations. DAVID: I thought all servers were private. Not with this type of security. How do you know? Oh, my God. Because, look, in my business, you know not to fuck with this kind of shit. You avoid this. You fuck with a private server, they will be all over you, and they'll come down on you hard, seriously. They can trace you like a fucking lightning bolt. They could be tracing us now. I don't want to know where you got this. I'm sorry, cuz. You're on your own. [ Gun cocks ] [ Door slams open, Sam screams ] Get down! Get against the wall! Do not move! Get against the wall! Check the window! We're clear! We're clear! How much you getting in kickbacks, Dale? Dave. You know what's in those trucks? Now, look-- It's a simple question. You don't understand. You sign them in every week. I-I just follow orders. You just follow orders. Yeah. You know what they do to those girls, huh?! Do you know what they do to those girls?! Dave-- Anything they want! You got a daughter, Dale. Come on, we're buddies, man. Fuck you! They killed Reg! What the fuck could I do? Please! I got a wife and kids, man. Who gave the order? Come on, Dave. They're gonna come after me, man. At least I die with my soul! Now, who gave the goddamn order?! Okay, okay. It was a woman. Her name is Danielle, and she arranges it. I-I just do what I'm told. I sign them in, and I sign them out. I swear to God, I didn't know what was in those trucks. Dave, please. [ Sniveling ] Please. You're a fucking piece of shit, Dale, you know that? You don't fucking deserve to live! Dave, please. Please. Let me go. You're gonna take care of Reg's kids, you hear me? O-O-Okay, okay. Okay. [ Crying ] BILLIE: Just be a minute. It's been awhile. Did you hear the news? What news? Good. Good, they kept you out of it. Who? It doesn't matter. [ Sighs ] You in a fight again? Work. It's always work. I used to hate when you went away. Yeah, I know. You made that clear. What do you want, David? I was-- I was hoping that we could talk. There-- There's better places and better times for that. No. Before you say anything, please, just... just-- just hear me out. I-I know that I should have said this years ago. Billie, I'm sorry. I was late. I should have been there for Meg. I don't go to sleep at night without thinking how much I should have been there, and it fucking eats me up inside. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [ Sighs, sniffles ] You know, Billie... I don't blame you for the way things went between us. I was at fault. I-I know that. We both know that. I refused to help myself. It was easier to run than to deal with it. I want the two of you to have everything out of life. You deserve so much more. Then why don't you tell her yourself? Meg? Come out, sweetie. Say hello to your father. Meg... Hi. You look good. Thanks. Honey, I am so sorry. No! Don't. It's too late for that. [ Sniffles ] I needed you. I needed you, Dad. I know. I know. I love you, Meg. I meant what I said, Billie. [ Crying ] It's okay. Mommy. [ Door opens ] [ Cellphone keys beeping ] [ Gasps ] My chance to surprise you for once. Your phone's been talking to mine. Apparently. Come on. Have a seat. Is that a threat? Is that one of your simple questions? Oh, how chivalrous. Start at the beginning. Of what? Your life is in my hands. You're a funny fellow. Don't pretend you're not frightened of me. What frightens me and what should frighten you is that I'm just a cog in a wheel with no beginning or end, just like you. You won't stop anything, prove anything or change anything, so why bother? So, what does the Stross Corporation do? It employs both of us. No, I work for a company that builds hospitals and water-treatment plants. I'm not mixed up in their shit. Really? When you worked around the world protecting executives so they could do as they pleased, you think you were working for the good guys? You and I are no different than the people we protect our execs from, people that get mixed up in their shit. So, what do the girls do for the corporation? Why do you think we're able to build hospitals and water-treatment plants where we build? What, you think we just walk into some country and go, "We want to develop on this spot here, so you better move, pay for it, and clean up after us"? No, fuck you! We want something, and the people that own the land want something in return. Life is a transaction. It's called business. Give me a name of who's responsible. For what?! No one's fucking responsible! Aah! Gah! That's not an answer I like! [ Panting ] Well, you're not gonna get one from me. [ Gunshot ] [ Danielle screams, groans ] You look at me. Fucking look at me.

Get in the car! Get in the car. Quick! [ Sirens wailing ] Come on! They're coming. Go! Come on. Go! [ Engine starts ] [ Tires squeal ] MAN: This whole notion that they didn't come here on their own terms, that they were smuggled in against their will and given false promises is not true. Stop falling for these girls' lies. They are professional liars to start with. They make their livelihood cheating the system, and they, uh, they exaggerate to protect themselves.
