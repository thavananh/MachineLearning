Room 31, elevator just around the corner. Please bring me a copy, Have someone get a flash drive, okay? The video surveillance here, pretty old school. Unfortunately only down the entrance area. I hope that gives us something. Please, after you. Who is the man? - Manuel Almeida. He has a Brazilian passport, but something's odd there. - How so? He apprently spoke German with no accent. Also some details: Dyed hair and glasses without a prescription. EC card? Credit card? - No, But a robbery? I don't believe it. The bedside table had 5,000 euros cash. And a plane ticket for a direct flight from Sao Paulo to Frankfurt. From there he went by train. - How long has he been here? Checked in on the 31st of August. Today is the 7th day. Did he meet someone? - No idea. He kept a low profile. While he was here, he ordered a sandwich. Kept the curtains closed too. Is the forensics team there? - They're stuck in Kreuzberg. The coroner too. Three, four hours. No sooner. Looks violent in there. Highly effective, unfocused, looks like an intimate killing to me. Did you test the rigor mortis? - You know Arlinghaus! If I contaminate his beautiful crime scene, he'll pop! If he has a problem, he has my number. I know this man. - Really? Thalheim. Michael or Markus. if you Google it, find a photo. The joint is almost stiff, eight hours ago, I would say. Here. Penetration angle and depth? We don't have three or four hours, to wait for the forensics to show up. Not in a case like this. "Thalheim" doesn't tell me anything. - About a year and a half ago, he dropped 20 million euros and left his pregnant wife here. OK. That passed me by. Angle from diagonally below, Penetration depth almost 10 cm... I would say 15, 18 stab wounds distributed over the entire upper body. The stabs to the chest... - That's right, an intimate killing! The videos! Yes, thank you. Yes. Excuse me. Yes? Murat, can I make a phone call? - Yes, of course. Henke Law Firm, Leibner speaking. - "Rita, it's me." Bille? Did you find him? Can you put me through to Uli? It's urgent. He's in Warsaw, talking to a client. He will come in tomorrow. Can I do something? No. Just don't tell anyone I called? - Sure, of course. Did you talk to Michael? I-I-I'll call you again! 17 months earlier Rita. - Bille, hello. Hey, did Michael have an appointment last night? He didn't want to leave yesterday, he wanted to stay with you. Did something happen? - Bille! Hey. Michael didn't come home. Did he have a meeting yesterday? A spontaneous client meeting, you know how it is. You stumble into one and the evening is gone. Then he would have contacted me. - He didn't? - Uli! Sit down! - Ha! That's about the last way to calm me down! - What should I do? Well, something! You're the top dog! Fine. You're going home now. I'll look for him and then I'll contact you. - He had trouble with a client. Clients and anger are synonymous. Come on now, scram! Or should I offer you a mint tea. Or... an dill pickle or something. Take care. Thank you. - Now he's awake. Sorry, Dr. Henke! She said she has heavy bleeding. - Who? She didn't give her name! One moment. Thank you. Yes. Henke. - "Gabi?" Bille! Are you that? I'm down here, with Murat. In the tea shop. Can you come down please? I, I'll come right away, okay? - "Thank you." Is this knife from your hotel kitchen? No, we use another brand. Look at this, was that the woman? Yes! Sybille Thalheim. Ex-wife of the dead. Immediately send a plain clothes officer for her, and send out an APB! - Okay. Go on! Braungart, I need a plain clothes officer. - Thank you. Bille? What's going on? Have you talked to Uli on the phone today? He's in Warsaw. Meeting his Russians. Hello, what can I bring you? - Thank you, nothing. Thank you. They like him. I don't think he'll call. I need him. - What happened? - Michael is back. I beg your pardon? - Yes. He is dead. - Michael? And the police think I killed him. What? - Rita found him by chance in a hotel. I went there and took a room. Did you speak with him? - I can't believe that was hiim. Why didn't he call me? - But it was him? - Yes? I went there last night, I was so angry and I wanted to talk to him. - Did you see him? - Yes. But my memory is totally gone! I woke up in my room, and everything was full of blood. And I had a knife next to me. A knife, that was from my kitchen. The police came, and I left there. Bille, that's really stupid! I'll take you to the police! No! I said: If I see him again, I'll kill him. Did you do this? I don't know! I can't go home! Then come to our place. - By tonight, at the latest, the police will catch you. Then you do this: Stand your ground! Rely on Uli! He'll get you out of it! - Don't you have a hiding place? Without a lawyer, I can't go to the police! Then just let me pick you up. - Without the police, my baby'd be alive! Please stop talking like that! - Ask Uli! He was there! You're welcome. - Thank you. Did your husband contact you? - No. Did you have financial difficulties? - No. Marital problems? - No. No! A man without problems leaves his pregnant wife and says nothing? Doesn't say where he's going. Doesn't promise, to catch up with them later. Supposedly everything's fine. Do you believe that? I'm not feeling well, can we talk another time, please? Please, I'm just right... - Bille? Uli! Oh, good that you are there. I have to lie down for a moment. - Yes, relax. Ulrich Henke is my name. I'm the lawyer. Rohrbach. - Show me the order! You know, I don't need them. This is an informal conversation. You find that informal? - The conversation is informal, the files may disappear here! Good. The conversation is now over. My client will answer no further questions. - Fine. Bille! Bille? Bille, what's going on? What is it? - Oh no! Oh no! Uli! Shit! - Oh no! Help! - Call an ambulance! Now! Oh no! If you don't want part in this, it's okay, but tell me now! Until Uli comes back, not an hour longer! And then you talk to him, and you go to the police together! Thank you. I still need something to wear. And a little money and a cell phone. I have to go back to practice for a little while. Wait for me in the car. It's in front, near the traffic light. Ten minutes, okay? - Yes, thank you. Everything is going to be alright, right? Hey, Bille? All good. OK? What about the kid? - We hope it survives. Are you the father? - No. - A relative? No. - Then please wait outside here. Uli? What happened? - I don't know, She's lost fluids. You can't go in there. Did she have any bleeding? - No idea, yes, maybe. I dont know. What will happen to the child? I don't know. But it's not good. If Michael ever comes back, I'll kill him. The same type as the murder weapon. Can I help you? - Yes. Please, give it to me. Oh no! "Henke, the hangman"! I know him from my court internship. I thought he was great, as a defense lawyer A-1! He had an office with the dead man, the two were close friends. - Are you from the NSA? That was shortly after my accident, when the case was in the press. My ex provided me with the daily news. Anyway, that's about all. Why "ex"? Did she leave? Can you do me a favor? - I'll keep it to myself! Tell me, which of your colleagues was in bunko at that time? We need a briefing! I didn't dig through the files! - One knife, three liters of blood, 18 punctures. You want support from bunko? What's that about? He made it to Brazil with 20 million euros. Nice and warm, everything smells good. Here the police are waiting with arrest warrant and an ex, you destroyed. Is there any reason for you to come back? Forgot his bikini? So now, what's that? A teddy bear. Natal Clinic I'm a medical doctor here. Otherwise only licensed midwives come in here. Up here is a yoga room. You can get blankets from there. There aren't any classes today. Well, nobody comes anymore. Look, here's something to wear, I hope it fits. And, um, shit! Nina's birthday present, it's already registered, but nobody knows the number yet. If Uli answers, give it to me. Thank you. Come here! Why did Michael come back? What did he want here? Maybe, maybe to see you. To apologize. To get you? But there was no call, no letter, no nothing... and then there he is. I'll find someone for Nina, or she can stay with Carla or whatever... I don't like to leave you alone! - I want everything to be the same as always. Promise me you'll stay here! - Yes. Uli should call me as soon as he's there, okay? Doesn't matter when. I need him! Bille? Ah, there you are. Here you have to sign this. What's is it? - It's the impoundment report. I made sure it's right. Thank you. And the house key. - It's downstairs. Can you deduct that? - Yes. Do you still need a signature? - Yes, right here. I'll make a note of that. So, then you have to sign here again, please. Okay, let's get out of here. Can I take this? - Yes, sure. Not really... But, okay. Send a copy of the impoundment report to the law firm. You're welcome. - Yes, will do. Reporter: Ms. Thalheim? What'll you do now? Where's your husband? Has he run away with 20 million? Where are you going now? Nina? Has Daddy called? No. Good day, my name is Warnke, from Homicide. What are you doing here? I wanted... - Nina, leave us alone! You know who my husband is? Yes. - Then leave your card here, and your supervisor will hear from him tomorrow. You know where she is. Right? Who? Did she call you? Did you meet her? I don't know what you're talking about but please leave my house. Go on now. - We searched Ms. Thalheim's apartment. And you are pretty much her only friend. I don't know where else to go! Are you sure you can really leave her alone? I don't know where she is. Last time I saw her was a week ago. Your husband is a defense lawyer. You know what he would advise her and I suppose you said the same thing to her. Let go. Let go! I'm so sorry. Mama! I have to practice a bit more. - Wait, I'll help you. That's okay. What's wrong with your hands? - They're sore from wheelchair. I don't have any calluses yet. I haven't been in a wheelchair for very long. Please come. Please come. Please go to your room, I'll come up right away. Okay? I'll be monitoring your phone, your mail and your Internet. If you contact Ms. Thalheim, we'll find her. But if you take me to her, I'll consider that as if she turned herself in. Discuss this with your husband and let me tell you how many years of in jail you want to spare her. Why should you help her? Because I have some idea what it's like to lose everything! Goodbye. Mr. Warnke? These are from my husband. You still have to develop calluses. Ow! Shit! Two days earlier Rita? - Hi. How did you know my new address? Ah, Uli talked? Once... and... twice. Your vases were yanked out from under you, right? Down on the corner is a baker. Coffee? Let's just stay here. So what's up? I saw Michael. What? Yes. - Where? In a hotel. The Hotel Süden in Rudow. Sure it was Michael? Yes, he had glasses and colored hair, I think so. Have you talked to him? - No no. I was totally perplexed! Did he see you? - No no. Did you tell Uli and Gabi that you saw him? He's your husband! Honestly, I think they're meddling in your life anyway. Without them the courts would have ruined me! That's so! What're you going to do? I'ill go there. Woman: She booked a room at this hotel for one night. When exactly she went to her husband's room is not on it. The hotel has only the outdoor cameras and one in the entrance area. Any suggestions? - We have to monitor Henke and his wife. Sooner or later she'll show up there, guaranteed! - Or already has. And Mrs. Henke knows where she is. I told her we'd monitor her. - What? In the circumstantial cases no judge will let you monitor people. - Then why'd you say it? Pressure is sometimes good as a decision-making tool. She wants to be a good friend. But what is a good friend? Tell me again, why exactly wife divorced you? She found a man who rolls around in diapers, probably somehow unsexy. Especially if she has to change him. If I smell, tell me, okay? I can't get that. Hey! Hey! Mike! Hi. Sorry, yes? Yes? Who are you? Who are you? Sybille Thalheim. The ex-wife of Michael Thalheim. Where did you get this number from? - Found it with Michael. Why did he call you? What did he want from you? Who was that? He didn't want to say. Do you need my help? Not any longer. You sure? There are clients who don't want to understand that they're responsible for the shit they're causing. You have to imagine it this way: The notary sets up an account in his name. WithOn which he manages the money of his client in trust. The intention is that the notary is immediately liquid, if he works for his client B. to buy a house. Or something like that. And if a notary with a well-heeled clientele sets up several such accounts, then huge sums can be accrued. - That was the 20 million? - Exactly. Mr. Thalheim then has all the accounts emptied in 15 minutes. And then transferred the money to accounts in Lithuania and Estonia and from there to Russia. For us, the case is closed, we can't access it. Did anyone except Michael Thalheim have access to the accounts? Only Thalheim had access to the accounts. Additionally, all transfers were signed by Thalheim itself. You believe in the murder has something to do with this? We don't quite know what to believe! I thought the suspicion was clear? The trail is clear! She was in the hotel room, and the murder weapon only had her DNA and defensive traces of her husband's. The motive is also clear. But? - The whole procedure is inconsistent. Everything seems well planned. She checks into the hotel, takes a knife from home, and kills her husband. Then she goes to her room and sleep eight hours, until we come! She flees, but leaves the murder weapon behind! Somehow... no! - Yes, but if it wasn't her, someone had to frame her for the murder. Yes. But who? And why? Mike? Mike? What? A break-in? Hey? Hello! Hey! Hello? What? Yes. Bille, Bille! It's me! - Uli! I just heard! - Finally. - Where have you been? Come on, I have to show you something. - What's going on here? Excuse me... it hurt for a while. Should I look for you? - It's allright now! Which month are you in? - The fifth. You don't really see it yet. - Fifth month. And you're here already? - Dr. Henke brought me here. She's checking on me tomorrow! I had gestosis with the first pregnancy. Everything's fine. I just heard the mailbox half an hour ago. What's going on? - Do you know this number? Where did you get that from? - From Michael's hotel room. He wrote it down. - Yes, yes, this is the number of Ganter, our auditor. He worked very closely with Michael. He came back for this reason, I'm certain. Did you talk to Ganter on the phone? - I called him. He didn't identify himself and hung up. Could it be that he helped Michael steal the 20 million? - No no. Not possible. Only Michael had access to the accounts. Why did Mike want to meet him? - No idea. - Where does he live? In Dahlem. Should I talk to him tomorrow? Yes, but first you have to check something . Look, this man, he stunned me. He nearly killed me, and then framed me for the murder. Bille, are you sure? - Very sure! Don't you owe a cop a favor who can help us. And if he has a connection to Mike's audit. Before you talk to Ganter. check his emails and see if he wrote to him. - No. Just this one thing. If I have that, I'll go I promise. Immediately. OK. But you can't stay here. The midwife saw you. Soon the police will show up. OK. - I'll take you away. Come. Stop. Rewind. Stop. - That was yesterday. At 17:35. Can we see that? - Mm-hm. Stop. Can you enlarge that? Remember tihs place? No one comes out here at this hour. I have to go in now, I'm cold. Yes? There's mineral water in the fridge. And beer too, if you want it. Thank you. It'll be warm in half an hour. Tomorrow morning I'll bring out a fresh gas cylinder. It'll be okay! Yeah? The photos, You'll find him, yes? Certainly! I can only lock the door from the outside. Thank you. Good night. Don't run away, okay? Thanks again. * Ringtone: Song of Pippi Longstocking. * #... and three makes nine. I make the world, how, how, how I like it. # Okay, have him. He has an interpol file. Arkady Gruschenko, 35, Russian citizen. Former professional soldier... was in Chechnya... Charged with illegal gun ownership in London. Residence? - London. What's he doing here? - The question is: what's he doing there? He doesn't live anywhere, he stays at Piccadilly. Okay, so? - If we both threw our money together, we could afford about half a square meter there. He's a bit too big for half a square meter. The complaint against him was dropped on bail. Who paid? - It doesn't say. - Who busted him? An officer named Taggart... Police District London / Central. Call him! - At this hour? You won't get anyone there! - Then get his private number! Warnke. Where? Drive home, I'll come to you. Half a hour! That was Mrs. Henke. Sybille Thalheim has disappeared from her hiding place. What kind of hiding place, where was she? - In a natal clinic in Neukölln. What's wrong? Secretly watching porn? It would be nice, yes. This is so sexy here that you'll get aroused! What's is it? Bankers mathematics. Nothing for girls with a German-English certificate! Well, excuse me! I know I'm pregnant but that doesn't mean I've lost it. My head still works. What's is it? Explain please. An pushy client. With a pushy lawyer. Let's call him "Pain in the Ass". Mm-hmm! So it is porn! Yes, actually. You have to develop a little thicker skin, otherwise you will be a tinnitus candidate in two years! Huh? I didn't understand what you said. Come on, that thing. Boom! We can try that out with Pain in the Ass. - Hm? Yeah? Come on. - How was it with the closed season? You have no closed season? - Come on. I'm the first in bed! - Nah, me! Yes. Hello? Uli? Yes! I'll be right with you, sweetheart! One moment. Stop! I have to go to Berlin! - Yes, wait a minute. Yes, where? Drive! Drive! Why are you calling me? I lost her. Then find her! Kulygin said I can count on you! Stop screaming. Where can she be? Go to Ganter's. Maybe she's with him. - I'm sorry. Where have you been? - I had a lot to do. So what's going on? Come on, let's go in. Come on. Good evening. - Good evening. Thank you. Are you free? - Yes. - I have to go to Dahlem. To Ganter, an accountant. I don't have the address. Could you find out for me? - I'll try. Here, maybe Günter Brand. Hm. After the disaster suddenly her friends and acquaintances weren't speaking to her. Try these three. I don't think she's here. - I still need her number. She has no mobile! Yes she does. I gave her the birthday present for Nina. Oh, mmm-hmm. I'll write down the number. What will you do now? We intensified the search around the Natal Clinic. We interviewed the taxi drivers. Watched the video recordings. Somehow she must have gotten away from there. And if we're lucky, we can locate her phone. - Gabi, why didn't you make her turn herself in? You think I didn't try? She can be a stubborn goat! You know her. - I have to go. Yes, sure. Um, say, did Mr. Thalheim have clients in London? Yes. But I don't know who. He took his confidentiality very seriously. With me as well. Does the name Gruschenko mean anything? Arkady Gruschenko, lives in London. I don't know the name. - Who is that? He's on the edges of the investigation. I can't tell you any more. Let me know if Ms. Thalheim contacts you. - Certainly. Wait! - I want to get out of here! I want to get out of here! - Wait! Take it off now! - Shhh, Quiet, very quiet. - Quiet? - Very quiet! Oh, my roses! - Yes, it's my turn. I'll get your roses. But be careful! The thorns! - The thorns are removed. You removed them? - 276 pieces. - Wow! - Heroic. And nobody there to kiss the cuts? - All cut off. Just put it in front there. - Kiss the cuts, I said! Yes, yes, I know. - Help! What's happening? Ah! What are you doing now? What's going on? - On three take off the blindfold. - Okay! Whoa! Tada! Did we inherit it? - Hm... Did you kill someone? - Yes. - In the garden under the roses. This is ours? - Yes. - Put me down! That's amazing! Check it out. This is our own house? - Tada! Oh! Where did that mattress come from? - Oh my! - Oh my! Finally something dirty. Nice to have you here. Nice to have you here. A 50,000 Euros deposit? For illegal possession of firearms? Grushenko was also involved in a shootout, and the Brits almost expelled him. Who paid? - This guy: Andrej... Kulygin, 53, a third-rate Russian oligarch. He has lived in London for three years. Gruschenko is his bodyguard and lives with him. In Piccadilly. - Yes, in Picadilly. Since 2012, he's also had German citizenship, a Russian German. And he is under police surveillance. He has various procedures on his rap sheet, including embezzlement, Money laundering. - Is there a connection to Michael Thalheim? The detective in London has never heard the name. Good, then we have to go through the databases in the Thalheim case again. Yeah, and it's my turn! Keep the change. Hello? Ganter: "Who are you?" - Sybille Thalheim. The wife of Michael. "I told you I won't talk to you!" - Listen! "I'll call the police. Understand?" You have to help me! My husband is dead! You have to help me. You're welcome! My husband is dead! You have to help me! My husband is dead! You have to help me, please! Thalheim is dead? - Yes, and the police think I'm the killer. In four or five hours they'll catch me, But first I have to know what's going on! - Nobody followed you? No. - Come in! Please. - I found your phone number with Michael in the hotel room. What did he want from you? He met with me twice in the last few days and asked for help. What kind of help? - He wanted his life back. He wanted to prove his innocence. That he didn't embezzle the money from the notary accounts. - Innocent? - Yes. 20 million euros! Who has it? I have no proof but a guess. - Namely? After your husband disappeared over the course of three months 17 million euros have been deposited in various accounts of Mr Henke. From Uli? - Allegedly for various mandates, which he accepted in Poland and Moscow. 17 million! In three months! But why? Uli is so good! On the contrary. His back was to the wall financially. Here, please. Take a seat. The money comes from 12 different sources. I knew two. They belong to a former client of Mr. Henke. Whom? - Kulygin, former Russian oligarch, not very reputable. Mr. Henke helped him get German citizenship. 17 million euros... and the remaining three? One can only speculate. - The Russian got it. Because he laundered the money? - I suspect so, yes. - Okay. But I thought only Mike had access to the Notary accounts? Yes, but his lawyer's assistant had a couple blank bank transfers with Thalheim's signatures so she could make smaller payments. Then she helped Uli steal the 20 million? No, she was on vacation when the money disappeared. So Uli took the blank transfer notes and paid the money to the Russians? Your husband, of course, asked him. That was a mistake. If your husband hadn't fled, he would've been dead a year and a half ago. Why did he come back? Why now? He didn't call once. It was just a coincidence that Rita saw him. - He didn't want to put you in danger. He had to prove his innocence. Only then would you have been safe. And how did he plan to do that? He wanted the sources of 17 million to reveal Henkes account. To prove they weren't solicitor fees, but the laundered money from the Notary accounts. And you could help him with this? - I copied all the account statements from a year and a half ago. He wanted to pick them up tomorrow. Yes. That's all I could do. Where are the they? They're the only chance to prove Michael's innocence. And mine too! Please! I really respected your husband. He was very honest. This is Gruschenko! Just a second. And he came here by car. Can you enlarge the license plate? - Not here. I'll get the master and run it through our computers. - Yes? If you give up now, I'll inform Kulygin. You know what that means! Hello? I'm sorry! They dragged me to Brentano's. Jeff wanted to meet me! - Ah, Jeff? The East Coast Sales Manager! And why did you have to meet Jeff? Because I'm supposed to work for him for 12 months. What? Twelve? I thought six! - No! Geraldine's having more fun changing diapers than we thought! Says Jeff. - Says Jeff. The boss. And, what does that mean now? - That means we now need to... Buy condoms, honey! It would be bad if the substitute for the pregnant teacher also had a bump. Before you go into the details... Let's go brush your teeth. Come on, bump! Good night! Good night, sweetheart. - Oh, that's great! Come on, are we going to brush both our teeth? - Oh God! A year New York. I can't believe it! I need alcohol! Oh God. - What about an apartment? They've rented something to me. In midtown, Fifth Avenue, 26th floor, two rooms. - Wow! Uh-huh. - Cool! Not bad. Can you handle it? Twelve months? Can we handle it? Can we handle it? Six hours flight. Yes! I think that's okay. We can handle that. Short trips to New York on the weekends. You have to earn it first! - I take my example from you! All a question of risk-taking! - Uli? Come! The little one. May I? Good luck. - Thank you. He hasn't let you go yet, really. Nonsense. - Not nonsense. Maybe he's a better match too. Too... - Huh? Well, Fifth Avenue and the whole thing here. - It's me! I am from Seehausen in the Altmark. OK? Let me romp around for another year... jogging in Central Park, Breakfast in Soho, then we pull the condoms off. - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. Do you want to know a secret? - If I don't have to keep it to myself. You can let me go. That's why I come back. Always. What is it? On the left. Police! Secure? Secure. Thank you! I'm taking Nina to school, I'll be back in half an hour. Who is this Gruschenko? You know him, don't you? It's... complicated. Let's talk later, okay? Can I say goodbye to Nina? She's already in the car. I think you need to shave! Gabi? Thank you. For what? For everything. My life. I have to hurry! Helluva time to gawk at my cleavage Excuse me. I'm actually the same. It's okay, I already got my compensation. What are you doing here? - I'm in the legal department. And you? I need the money to do a doctorate... medicine. Oh, cool! - Look what we have here. Extra moist, raspberry, woodruff. ribbed, sensitive. These are our giveaways. Because of AIDS research. Choose something. My girlfriend Bille. - I'm Uli. Hey, Uli, look, what do you want?

Wow! - Wow, is that for us? Yes, I baked it. Would you like us to turn it off? - Yes. Bille? - Yes? - I think I forgot the speech at home! No, it's in the office. Take a look. I saw it there, I think. OK. - Wow! - Have a snack! You don't have to snack on everything of mine! - Excuse me. Uli? Uli? Hello. - Uli's in the back. What's it about? - Um, um... I... I have no idea how to tie a Windsor knot! I could try it. - I can just ask Uli. I can only do it this way. - no, I can just ask Uli. Where should I put my coat? - Um... there. I'll just leave it off. Because, I'm totally nervous anyway. - How come? My parents have come to the inauguration. - Why do they make you nervous? I have such a hero-father. He had three companies at my age. One school, one career, one wife. - One son. - Yes. Here he is. - Can we warm things up? I hate lawyer small talk. You're not one, are you? - Um... I'm Uli's partner. This is our office. - You are Mike? - Yes. Bille! Bille, I have the speech! Thank God. Oh, and you are Bille? Yes. You've been hiding her from me? - Yeah, obviously! I love lawyer small talk! Did I miss something? Oh, I think so! Cheers. - Yes. Cheers. Cheers. We'll get it out, right? - Hm. Let's do the type analysis test. - Say what?

Regularly, always the same, or... - Sometimes. What's this? - Excuse me, we just chatting! I've waited for an hour! - That's my fault, I'm sorry I've been bending her ear. Sorry. - Can we go now? Yes, and where? - To the Méditeranée? Oh, a very good choice, there is a world-class saltimbocca. A great veal dish with fresh sage. And two overjoyed guests... let's go! Bye! - Have fun! - Ulrich! Ulrich! Why? Why did you do it? We were a good couple, Bille. Finish it. I spent the night with Mike. Yeah. I'll send someone to pick up my things. OK. How many of your exes do you still have contact with? None. I'll do anything to get you back. Hi, Gabi. - "And?" Hm. Can you take care of him a bit? "Shit, Bille!" "Where is he?" I think he'll sleep in the office today. OK. Get your life in order, okay? Yes. Yes? Yes! May I? My name is Warnke. I conducted the investigation in your case. I have to record your statement. Are you up for doing that now? What's this? The proof that my husband is innocent. Can we take that and the statement somewhere else? Yes. In my office? The officers can drive us. Good. I'm so sorry.
