Good. Good boy. So, if you're happy to swing by our house, then maybe we can both pick up Mum and see her together? OK. Alright, thank you. Hey. Oh. Hey. You left without saying goodbye.

With all that eye contact over lunch? What was that? Hey... Jake! What the fuck?! Alright? Fuckin' hell. I didn't even know you were gonna be here. Uh-huh. Let's just go back inside, OK?

Come on. Let's...let's get this sorted. - Up you get. - Stop moving me. No, it's OK. It's OK. Stop moving me. I'm just gonna get your jumper off. Arms up. There we go. Come here. OK? It's OK, come on. Let me sleep, Dad. Clean you up. Come on. You take your dress off. I'm gonna get a cloth. Hey. Come on. You missed dinner, darling. You hungry? Sit down, darling. What's wrong? You OK? Hey? Blaze. Did something happen to you? Oh... Oh. Jesus. Can you confirm that this is your daughter's? Yeah. Yep. Forensics have also recovered a urine sample that, at this stage, does not appear to belong to the deceased. We can query her further tomorrow, but we do need to take some DNA evidence now. Yep. Mate, I understand this is extremely hard. Yeah. Would it be easier if her mother was present? Uh, she's not in the picture. Oh. Well, in that case, my female colleague will accompany Blaze to the hospital and stay with her through all the procedures. No, I'll stay with her. I'm-I'm her dad. I'll stay with her. At some point today, we need to go back to the police station to complete our statements. No. I'll be right there with you the whole time, Blaze. No. They need your help, Blaze, to find the man. Must be starving. There you go. How about your favourite? Scrambled eggs on toast. And... ..then, I don't know about you, but I am in the mood for six hours of Lord Of The Rings. Which should take us through to dinner. That's pizza. And what is that topping I never let you have? That disgusting topping? Nutella? Yeah. Today's your lucky day. Six hours of earnest hobbits... ..and chocolate on pizza. Talk to me, sweetheart. Hey? I'm here to support you. There's a lot of people affected by this tragedy, but you're my priority. It's been two weeks. How are you feeling today? You've got a committal hearing coming up. And so one of the things that we'll be doing together is helping you feel clear about describing the accident to the legal professionals who will be asking you questions. It wasn't an accident. OK. Well... ..just remember you did the right thing. You told your father, and you're helping the police. That's very brave. I did nothing. I don't want you to feel shame in here. Maybe we could find some more constructive ways to describe how you're feeling. Dragon. I have treated a lot of kids like you and I can see you're feeling a lot of big things. And we just need to contain those so that you can feel more confident in a courtroom. Are you having any nightmares? You know, Blaze, you might be surprised to hear this but it's commonly accepted that dreams, and therefore nightmares, don't mean anything. So the most important thing for Blaze right now is resolution. She needs closure. She has to see the legal process through. Based on today, though, I'm not entirely sure how she will present in a committal hearing. In addition, the sleep deprivation's only gonna make her more difficult to manage. Now, I can prescribe something to help... Well, hang on, she's only 12 years old. Her brain isn't fully developed. Look, as you'd appreciate, Jade, I've never been in a situation like this before. I-I'm looking to you to guide me. To guide us. Can I also suggest that Blaze receives some psychiatric support outside the court system? Might help her distinguish between reality and her imagination and...help you both find a new normal. I didn't realise this was purely procedural support. Zephy, that woman. I needed you out there.

If it makes you more comfortable, Blaze, you're welcome to stand. Right. Blaze, you ready? Ms Simmons. Hello, Blaze. Thank you for coming in today to help us all understand this tragedy. I want to start at the beginning... I saw him kill her. Just try to answer my questions one at a time, please, Blaze. Let's try this again. Am I correct in saying that you're 12 years old? Yes. And you live with your father only - correct? Yes. Have you ever seen this man before? Only once before today. Please answer 'yes' or 'no'. Yes. Blaze... ..do you kiss people you love? Yes. If you kiss people you love, what made you think that Jake was trying to hurt Hannah when he kissed her? Hannah? Your Honour... That was her name. You didn't know that? Blaze... ..do you know what sex is? Objection. Reliability of witness. Prosecution consented. This child is their whole case. I'm going to allow that question. Ms Simmons. Blaze, let me repeat the question. Do you know what sex is? Yes. Have you ever seen anyone having sexual intercourse? I've seen animals on TV. I've seen some stuff on the internet. Not much. OK. Do you know there are different kinds of sex? Have you heard of bondage? - Unfair question. - Your Honour! Counsel, I think we can move on. Blaze, if you were concerned about Hannah, why did you not scream for help? I was... I was just trying not to see. Waiting for it to be over. So when you were trying not to see, your eyes were closed? Yes, some of the time. I understand. You were embarrassed. Are you aware that in the past Jake and Hannah had been in a relationship? Oh, this is bullshit! - Fuck you! - Young man! I'm going to have to ask you to absent yourself now, please. Would you mind? Ms Simmons. Blaze, have you ever told a lie? Could it be true that, in fact, you didn't really understand what you saw? You know there is no-one to corroborate your story? You stayed watching something that you know that you shouldn't watch. - You felt shame. - No. Jake left Hannah... No. ..soon after they had sex. Jake testified that she was attacked after that. - No. - For God's sake! Ladies and gentlemen, that is enough. I'm calling an adjournment. We're done. She's no longer legally obligated to be part of the process. They're saying her state of mind is unreliable. Hannah! It's not an upside, Mum. He just gets to wait it out, and it could be years before the trial starts. Her name was Hannah. Oh, that solicitor. How does she sleep at night? I failed her, Zephy. She's basically being told that she's lying, that what she saw didn't happen, and you know how her mind works. I just... I'm just really worried that she'll... ..that she's just...you know, that she's just gonna lose it. I have to go. No, I've gotta go.

"Stop fucking swearing." It was a lame answer. I'm...I'm sorry. Did you know it takes four to six minutes to die from a brain bleed? - Who told you that? - Internet. You know that you can always come to me if you... ..if you want to talk about that stuff. Even if it's adult stuff? Yeah. You're being ridiculous. Ow! Ow! Stop! Stop it! - Have fun. - I'm getting the bus home. Um...hot. I wouldn't mind me some of that. Girls, stop talking. Sorry. How about you? Um... I'm a virgin, so... Yeah. Me too. But hopefully not for too much longer. And, I mean, you could get it any time you want to, Blaze. You're seriously beautiful. Anna, you're up. Blaze! You know that's an illegal move! Go do wall sit, now. - You OK? - Yeah. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! - Blaze, what's going on? - Stop! Stop! Stop! It's him! He killed her! Stop! Stop! Stop! Argh... Let me out! Blaze. No! - Blaze! - No! - Tea? - Oh, thank you. - Thanks. Cheers. - No worries. - There's milk in the fridge. - Ah. Seem to know your way around. I stay with my little sister when she has to be here overnight. This place kind of scares the hell out of her. Oh. That's very nice of you to stay with her. It's no big deal. I probably couldn't sleep at home knowing she was here alone. And my mum can't leave the others. Mmm. That's... Plus, we get to hang out, so... Who are you here with? It's cool, man. - Oh, shit, I'm sorry. - You should eat something. It helps. Oh... Thank you. Thanks. Sorry. Has anyone spoken to you about medication before? Yeah. I...I thought it was too soon. I want to go home. Yeah, we just have to sort this out first, Blaze. Um... You know, it's gone a bit far. Yeah. Will the medicine kill my dragon? Here you go, darling. Blazey. Blaze. Daddy, I can't. My hands are too big. Zephy. Will the medicine kill my dragon? It's been weeks now, Mum. She's not getting any better. So you guys think you know better than me, huh? Fuck, you probably do. ♪ She said I can be a frog ♪ I can be a bat ♪ I can be a bear ♪ Or I can be a cat ♪ She said I can be a lion ♪ I can be a Gila monster ♪ I can be a warrior Indian ♪ I can be a helicopter ♪ She said I can be a wolf ♪ I can be a finch Ow! ♪ I can be a jaguar ♪ Or a locust on a branch ♪ She said I can be a monkey ♪ I can be a tiger ♪ I can be a tornado ♪ Knocking down your wires ♪ Well, it seems like she can be anything ♪ Any kind of creature ♪ She wants to be...

You could've burnt the house down. So, I kissed that hot jiujitsu boy. Which one? Does it matter? I actually don't remember his name. But he accidentally stuck his tongue up one of my nostrils. It was so gross. Are you sure it was an accident? So, was that him? The guy you were yelling at? My mum told me what happened after you lost it on the bus. That was him. I kinda lost my mind. - Wow. - Yeah. Fuck him. Mum said you had to testify at a pre-trial something. Good on you, Blaze. Yeah. He isn't locked up, though. The court case is still going and Dad doesn't want me to be involved anymore. My uncle didn't get into trouble, either. My sister told my mum and everything. He still comes around for Christmas. It's fucking disgusting. Fuck. Come on, Blaze. - Come on, Blaze. - Fight! Let's go, Blaze. Come on, now! Come on, Blaze. Come on, now! - Let's go! - Yes! - Yes! - Let's go! Come on. Come on, Blazey! Come on. - Yes, Blaze! - Yes! Yes! Whoo! Yes! Beast! Whoo! That was awesome! So awesome! - Dad, are you crying? - I'm just... Oh, my God. You need to chill out. - No. Thank you. - Not crying, not crying. Bag. - You did really well, honey. - Yeah, yeah. Have fun, guys. I'm proud of you. ♪ Fuck it ♪ Fuck her... So you get first pick of future-loves. ♪ Fuck it... Intense. - Boom. Got him. - Oh, gross. Are you sure this is it? Yep, this is it. Do you know what you want to say? Blaze. It's OK if you're not ready. Can we help you? I know what I saw. Jake, what is she talking about? Dunno. I've never seen her before. - Fuck, Blaze. - I know what I saw. Come on. Blaze. I'm sorry if this upsets you, Blaze, but I'm your parent and I'm responsible for you. And just so you know, I'm planning on getting the ceiling repainted next week. Please don't look at me like that. I...I don't deserve that. So what? I'm fine. I only need my dragon and my army and Hannah, and I don't understand why you can't see that. I'll be downstairs when you're calm enough to discuss this. ♪ Surrounded ♪ Fireless and fleet ♪ In danger eat ♪ In danger eat ♪ Fireless and fleet ♪ In danger eat ♪ Surrounded ♪ Surrounded ♪ Surrounded ♪ Desire ♪ Desire ♪ Desire... Blaze. No, don't, don't! What the fuck are you doing?! - Luke! - Get out! Get out! Luke, maybe you should sit down. You sit down there and you do not move! Do not move! I cannot look at you right now! Mate, you need to talk to the police. Yeah, and-and you... Can you just mind your own fuckin' business, please?! What are you reading? I just read the same word a thousand times. My brain is so munted on these meds. So, why are you here? Bipolar. Melancholic depression. Anger management. Maybe an infection in my brain. Fuck knows. You? Oh, you know, I took my clothes off to the moon. You're cute. Stay close. You know, Blaze... ..I realise that you have no reason to trust me any more than anyone else, so... ..maybe instead of me asking you all the questions, you could ask me some. What would your parents have called you if you were a boy? Noble. Mmm. Thank God for that, eh? What is bondage? Bondage, Blaze... ..is the practice of consensually tying or restraining your partner for sexual stimulation. Did you know that when a dragon turns lunar white, it symbolises death and rebirth? I...I didn't. Wow. Why would a person... ..rape someone they like? Blaze, it can be... ..confusing to grasp that most people know their rapist. A rapist is often driven by... ..an exaggerated sense of entitlement, a lack of guilt or... ..a lack of compassion for others. Hey, I like your crooked eye. - Yeah? - Yeah. Ah, it took me... ..it took me some time, but... ..I like it, too. Why am I locked up but Jake isn't? I work with a lot of survivors. Like you. What you and Hannah experienced in that laneway... ..that will echo through your whole life. Some days it will feel... ..really close, take up all your vision. Other days you might not think of it at all. Blaze? I need you to remember... ..you are not broken. Healing isn't linear. Yeah, I, uh... I got those after some shit happened to me a few years ago. My dragon likes cherry blossoms. Well, that doesn't surprise me. You're a beautiful dragon. Zephy? No, Zephy... I missed you, beautiful girl. I'm not the same, Dad. I can see that. Zephy? Zephy. Hey... Hi. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Please stay. I need you. Don't leave me, please. I'll make it better, Zephy. I'll make it better. I promise you. Hi. Mate, I'll catch up with you. Hi. How are you going? My dad doesn't want me to go back to court, but I just... I get it. My dad stopped my little brother from going back to court. I still tell him what happens, though. I fucked it up so badly last time. I understand if you don't do it. I wish... I just wish I had something to say... ..to testify to. Zeph? Zephy? Zeph? Zephy?
