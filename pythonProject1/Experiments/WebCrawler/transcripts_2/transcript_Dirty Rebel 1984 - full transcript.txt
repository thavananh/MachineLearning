Whatever we were, Ivan Konig and I were part of Sarajevo. And somehow, we survived the long years of the war to finally return home. Little did we know that our story had just begun. Hey, Ivan, let's stop and have a cigarette. Yeah, sure, I could use one. Six years is a long time. Will you feel strange when you take off your uniform and put on civilian clothes? Maybe I won't have to. Colonel Bromwich would like to see me. He promised to activate me. What are your plans, Ivan? Well I have some land, and if I'm lucky, my sweetheart will be waiting for me with open arms. Well old friend, goodbye. Hey, keep in touch. Here, this is yours. Topolac: You keep it. You always smoked more than I did anyway. (unison) Cheers. Old woman: To our hero. Ahh! Damn that's good. So you've become a Lieutenant and a hero. Nobody from our village has ever done that before. That's only (mumbles). Well then, back to the farm, hmm? Where else? Good luck. Did you bring any money back? A shirt from France. Old woman: Beautiful material. (mumbles) soap. It's a razor. Old woman: That's really something. Greedy villager: That's all? You must be kidding, you spent six years for that? And this. Greedy villager: Who is the other guy in the picture? Topolac: He's my best friend. He saved my life. (gunshot) (gunshots) Topolac: Colonel Bromwich, nice shooting, sir. Bromwich: Thank you, Captain Topolac. Topolac: May I try, sir? Bromwich: Sure, be my guest. (gunshots) Bravo, Topolac. I'd sure like to have you in my staff. Unfortunately, that's impossible now. It's political nepotism, usual thing. How about becoming a policeman for the county commission? What do you say? I suppose that is better than nothing, sir. You won the peace for us, and now you'll be able to protect it. Well, I sure do appreciate the opportunity. I'll go after all of them. The bastard war profiteers, the loan sharks, the land grabbers, the corrupt politicians who became rich while the people starved and the country went broke! The pay is okay. Your rank won't change from captain, just the uniform. Well, I'll tell you one thing, they'll know they've got a captain. (thunder) Man: Ivan! Hey, Ivan! Ivan: Hey, what's up? We're going to work! I can't believe that. What the hell kind of work are you up to? You know, steal some damn chickens and goats. Maybe some pigs, ducks, geese, stuff like that. Anything that will bring us some dough. Your old man, he always came with us. We thought you would come too. Maybe I'll go get an honest job and go see my girlfriend! The war has had a bad effect on people, Captain. This may look like a sleepy little village to you, but don't let it fool you. We know that many of the people have guns, so all they need is a strong leader. If such a man appears, we are in real trouble. Remember, Topolac, our country is broke. So is all of Europe. There are lots of poor and unhappy people out there. Topolac: I understand, Commissioner. I am a soldier. I'm always ready to serve my country, with my life if need be. You can depend on me, sir. Very well, Topolac. So then, now that you fully understand your responsibilities, I'd like you to start in the morning. Ivan: Elena, darling! Oh, Ivan, you frightened me! You're back. I can't believe it. Yes, I'm back. No, no, Ivan, not here! People might see us. So did you miss me? You never wrote me. I didn't know if you were dead or alive. Aw, come on! What do you want me to do? You just come back into my life from out of nowhere. You haven't changed at all, Ivan. Come here! Oh, I'm glad you're back. I'm so happy, did you really miss me? I missed you terribly, darling. I missed you. Oh God, I missed you! I need five qualified builders and 10 laborers. Builder: I'm a builder, sir! Another builder: So am I! Bullshit! You're all ordinary laborers. That's all. Who wants it? All of us! Bullshit. I'll take all. Let's go, driver! Laborer: Ivan, aren't you gonna join us? Who's the jelly belly? Oh, that son of a bitch. He became a millionaire during the war, and now the bastard cheats his workers out of most of their pay. Urkovic: Get up! (knocking) Wake up, you lousy bums! You got so much work to do, you lousy bastards! Don't know why I waste time with such idiots. Get up, come on! Get your asses moving. You heard me. Let's go! Dumb bastards. All right, let's move! Stop! I want all of these bricks taken apart and stacked up. And not a single brick should be missing. You understand? We understand. Let's go, driver. Ivan: Jelly belly bastard. Sergeant: Attention! Topolac: In the name of the king. (unison) In the name of the king! Topolac: Fall out! Urkevich: Right, just sign your name. Maid: All right, Mr. Urkovic, we're finished now. We're going home now, okay? Let me see what else is under your skirts. See whether you stole anything. Maid: Oh stop that, Mr. Urkovic. Oh stop, stop it. Urkovic: Nice ass. I'm short today's pay. Urkevich: What can I tell you? It's not my fault. Why not? You're lazy. Took you seven days to do what you should've done in five. I want my money. Get out of here! Oooh, ahhh, you son of a bitch! Yes, what is it? We have a problem. You know the artisan's factory where they make the jam? One of the workers fell right into the strawberry jam machine and... mashed his arm to a pulp. Really, Sergeant, did you have to? We brought in a laborer who attacked Mr. Urkovic. He fractured his nose. He claims to have internal injuries. Here's a complaint. Was the attacker armed? Sergeant: No, but he had this in his pocket. He probably stole it somewhere. What are your orders, sir? Bring him here. Immediately! Here is the prisoner you requested to see, Captain. Well... It is you. Sergeant, go get us a couple cups of coffee. Yes, sir! Sit down. Well, I thought that you would have been off living in some army barrack somewhere. Topolac: And here I am a cop. They didn't want me. It's... it's really only politics. That will be all, Sargent. You know, I do understand you. If I were in your place I probably would have done the same thing. He is an asshole. And he is the worst kind of bastard. But that's how it goes. You know they don't care about people like us and what we did for our country. The only ones that count today are the users and wealthy war deserters. And the rest of the people like Urkovic. All the ideals we did have during the war was all a dream. Opportunists have all the positions of real power, prestige, and everything. All we can do is try to make the best of it. Both of us. War heroes. But back to your case. You really overreacted. There are other ways. Such as? This is a list. Swindlers and war profiteers as well. Urkovic is very powerful. Half the politicians in this country are on his payroll. He owns almost everybody. You picked the worst guy to lock horns with. I'll talk to the commissioner. I will talk about your case. Let's hope he'll understand. He is really full of shit. He claims an unprovoked attack among other things. And attempted murder. You're in for two years at least. Let's hope, my friend, they don't buy Urkovic's bullshit story. I'm with you. Sergeant: Where should we take the prisoner, Captain? Topolac: Take him to a holding cell. Sergeant: Yes, sir. Topolac: Sergeant, come here. Sergeant: Yes, Captain. At your disposal, sir. Return this to him. He risked his life for his country to earn it. Yes, sir. I came to see you for two reasons, sir. What is it? Sir, when I took this job I vowed to do my best. Here, sir. What is this? This is a list of war profiteers and swindlers in our territory. I have proof on all of them. I don't understand. Who asked you to do all of this? Commissioner, I really thought it was one of my duties. To keep law and order. Very good, Captain. Don't ever you mention that list anymore. I mean what I say. Yes, sir. All right, I'll give it to you. Today's pay, huh? You'll get it now. How you like this, you smart ass son of a bitch ? (struggling, groaning) Fool around with me, I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you! Here's your two days' pay! How do you like that? All right. (chuckles) Sergent: It's the prisoner Konig, sir. He must have had some help from the outside. (drumming) Drummer: Citizens of Austria! Prisoner Ivan Konig has escaped from county jail! By order of the state Commissioner, Ivan Konig has until noon today to surrender. If not, he will be shot on sight! Citizens of Austria, Prisoner Ivan Konig has escaped from county jail! By order of the state Commissioner, Ivan Konig has until noon today to surrender. If not, he will be shot on sight! (phone ringing) Ivan: Good evening, Urkevich. You're surprised, huh? Welcome to my home, Konig. Let's you and I be friends. You just shut your mouth. Take anything you want! Open it. Sit down. Feet in the water. Urkovic: Go ahead, go ahead, take it all. You're a thieving bastard. These certificates may be non negotiable, but at least you won't get any. Urkovic: My money! Oh no. My money, it's burning! No, no, no, please! You don't even deserve to live. No wait! No wait! I'll be seeing you. Sergeant: The honorable citizen Urkovic is in the hospital with heavy burns over his body and a broken jaw. His water tower was blown up. He burned down the barn and blew up his outhouse. In addition to these charges, Konig stole 1,300 gold coins, 20 negotiable bonds, and 15,000 dinars. That's all bullshit. Total amount... One hundred thousand... thirty four dollars and no cents. Voiceover: Now listen closely, everybody. I'm gonna read this for you one more time. Wanted, dead or alive. Ivan Konig, rebel, dangerous and armed. Last seen in the mountains of Sarajevo. Reward to be paid immediately by the governor of Bosnia. 1,000 in gold coin. Ivan: So now you're stealing the government's trees, huh? I thought you were forest agent. Bastards everywhere! This wood is good for making things. I'm trying to sell some stuff at the pound. And you? All right? Were you able to see your girlfriend? Did you know there's a big price on your head, hmm? Bastards! If I only knew where your camp is, I would bring you food and supplies and stuff like that. You can trust me. But I do trust you, my friend. Up there, where we all used to play. You know what? I've got three bombs. I bet you can use them. Okay. Bring them up. Sergeant: Let's go. Come on, let's go. Topolac: Sergent, where are you going ? We have information where we could find Konig. All you want is the reward. It's my fault he got away, Captain. So it's my duty to get him. Sergeant: Ivan Konig! Ivan Konig! Surrender! You better give up now, Konig! You haven't got a chance! Hands up! Now drop your guns! I said drop them! Lie down. Tie yourselves up. How are you, old friend? How about a drink, huh? (speaking foreign language) (gunshot, groaning) Ivan: Elena, back in the house. Act as if nothing happened! Sergeant: Konig's here. There's his horse. And look, there's his boat. (horses clomping) (screaming) Elena: What do you want ? Is Konig around? No. I told you he wasn't around. If you're lying, we'll be back for you. They're gone. You're safe now. There's something I've been wanting to tell you. I'm pregnant. Ivan: And I love you. All right, you can bring him in. What is this, Mr. Commissioner? I am clean. Commissioner: Stop lying, you thief. Mr. Commissioner... Commissioner: Bring in the other thief. Thieves? Commissioner: Not a word from either of you. I didn't say anything, Mr. Commissioner. What about this? I know all about your codes. Why don't you tell me? He's already told us about your petty thievery. Mr. Commissioner, how can you say that? -This paper. -What paper? The people on this list have already been robbed by you. Gold coins, watches, jewelry, cash, and plenty of personal property. -Isn't that about it? -Yeah. Please, Mr. Commissioner, don't beat me. Ivan Konig, what's that got to do with me? I want you to find out where he's hiding. How can I do that? He's dangerous! He stole some valuable things, watches and rings. And guns. Those things have changed hands at least three times. Commissioner: Exactly. You know the people he must be dealing with. That's the place to start. Come here. Or do you prefer to rot in jail? I'll help you. Elena: Ivan, somebody is coming! Please, Ivan, be careful. Konig: Hold it right there and put your hands up! Thief: Konig, is that you? Konig: You know it's me. Get off that horse and lie down! I said lie down! Ivan, I am your friend. You must believe me. I come to see if I can help! Do you need any guns, ammunition, anything like that? I can get them for you if you want. And who gave you the guns? You know. They forced me to. No, Konig! Ivan, what are you going to do? No, don't! The commissioner made me do it! Please, Ivan, please! Ivan! Oh my God. You're not going to burn me! Go on, give my regards to the commissioner! Thief: Oh, oh my God, ooooh! Hurry now! The river's only a few hundred yards away! Thief: I'm burning! I'm burning! I'm burning! (gunshot) Sure, he was a petty thief, but he didn't deserve to die like this. Did he say anything? No, he was dead. He was shot in the back. That's a hell of a way to go. Sergeant: Yes, sir. It's Konig. Who else? Konig has got to be stopped. That dirty rebel. Where are you going? They say that rebels should not be involved with women. They say it brings them bad luck. I have to go now, but I'll be back. I gotta keep moving. I feel them closing in on me. If they ever find me here, they're apt to kill you too. Without you, I wouldn't want to live anyway. Now I fight not only for our country but for us and the baby. Doofus: I'm going to kill Konig. I'm going to shoot Konig. I'm going to get that 1,000 gold coin reward. I'm going to kill Konig! I'm gonna kill him dead dead dead! You won't be so pretty, Konig, when I get through with you. I'm gonna kill you dead dead dead! Konig, I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you Why don't you knock off that silly drivel? I really am going to kill him. I'm going to kill the Konig. I'm gonna kill him. I'm going to really kill him. He's gonna be dead dead dead. He's really gonna be dead. Dead dead Konig. When I get through with him (mumbles). Mama will be proud of me when I kill Konig-- Shh, shut up. I think it's Konig. Doofus: Hold it! Drop the rifle. Hands up. All right, just stand still now. Don't you move. It's really you, Konig! (groaning) Ivan: Stop, stop, hold it right there. Whose carriage is this? Urkovic's. (gunshot) Ivan: So you're Jelly Belly's daughters. Get down. How many men had to work for your father for nothing to get these? And how many farmers lost their land for these? And this? At your service, Commissioner. It's that goddamn rebel. I've had more than enough of him, Captain. Your Konig is a barbarian who robs and kills and makes us all look like fools. He's giving the money to the people, and they're giving him help. The minister of Bosnia sent me this message himself. "I want to know who is really running your country. "Is it you, or the rebel Konig?" I am really doing all I can, Commissioner. Those stupid lists of yours have wasted all your time. Those very rich people you seem to hate so much are the only ones who pay taxes, and if you don't know that, it's about time that you did. So what we have here is a very serious problem which must be solved. I did my best, Commissioner. I have sent posses and informers, I have made every effort to find out where he is hiding. No one seems willing or eager in trying to help us. Don't you know they're hiding him, Captain? Ivan is their hero. The people are running scared. Whenever the police and soldiers enter a town, the people close their doors and windows. We have a civil war on our hands, an uprising. We don't want a Lenin and Bolshevik revolution here. You saw what happened in Russia. One of our mountain patrol was ambushed by a group of Ivan Konig's bandits, and we lost three men. The next day, as the bandits were preparing another attack, our soldiers used some old tricks to lure them in. But instead of taking prisoners, they killed every one of them. Many of those men were from the villages in that area, and now the villagers are incensed. The governor of Bosnia is demanding that troops be sent from Sarajevo. If that happens, it will be the end of me. All because of one man. -Konig must be stopped. -(gunfire) I am well aware of my duty, Commissioner. It's time you were. Otherwise, it means a letter of termination for you. You'll do your best. Look what I caught for you. Uh-huh. Those coins will feed a lot of people down in the village. Mmmhm. Get the rest of the gold coins out of the bowl up there. As usual, take the gold and the jewels to the jeweler. Get the money and give it to the shoemaker who'll give it to those six families who need it right away. Just like before. Oh, by the way... Here's some more money to go with it. Be careful. Don't worry, I'm always very cautious. I'll be right back. That's a very valuable ring. Look at the size of that pearl. All right, how much in money? Not very much. Whatever do you mean? The police have been watching me constantly now. My people are afraid to deal. The prices are down. It's hard to fence the stuff off. 300 dinars, that's all. Elena. Here is the money for those six diamonds. I hope it'll be enough. I am sure it will be. I don't know what the people would do without you and Ivan. I'll bring you some more next week. Wait a second. We just might have a serious problem. What kind of problem? I must tell you. There is a rumor going around. There is an informer among us. People say it's the jeweler. He's been seen going in and out of the police station. I was just with him getting money from him. Now wait, it's only a rumor anyway. If it turns out to be true, we'll have to do something about it. No matter, Ivan will shoot him. See you later. My best to Ivan. Topolac: A true friend, Ivan. Just hoping to return some of the wealth stolen from the people. And now I must kill him if need be. Duty, is it my duty to hunt down my best friend for those corrupt bastards? God, it's funny how money destroys the souls of men. So be it. Such is the life of a soldier. Private: Say, Captain? Topolac: Make it short, Private, I'm in a hurry. Can I be excused from going, sir? For what reason? I don't wanna go against Konig. What did you say? Are you a policeman or not? Hear this, you better come along or it's your goddamn ass! He saved my father's land. Even so, it must be done. Yes, sir, my Captain. I understand. I know just how you feel. I too hate it. What's bothering you? Ivan: Nothing. You seem restless. I can almost feel the noose. Topolac is coming to get me. Sooner or later, I knew I had to face him. Surround the house. Put the horses over there. Everybody waits for my command. (barking) Where are the dogs? A dog brothel, sir. What is that? That's a bitch dog in heat, Captain. They're all having a good time. All that commotion will let him know we are here. I'll take care of it. Topolac! It's only the village dogs. (explosion, screaming) They'll kill you! They'll kill you! (gunshot)
