But I do all the milling here! Yet he's still grumpy. And so are the farmers when I'm behind. Only his daughter Marie is nice to me. Here come the farmers. It's back to work I go. The miller himself never does a thing. All he does is drink wine and tell tall tales. You should hear him! - Cheers, neighbor! - Cheers, miller Kunz! Your daughter is a good worker. And highly skilled! The best in the land. She got the flax in all in one day. Spun it into fine linen and sewed a skirt. - Wore it to the dance that evening! - She did all that in one day? It's true! I'm telling you. Well, if you say so, I suppose it must be true. As true as my name is Kunz. Come, let's drink. Your health, Mr. Kunz. And to your hard-working daughter! Run to the store and get us a jug of wine. Yes, but... Look at that. All out of money. And the King's levy has to be paid. Hans! The little loafer's deaf. Can I help you? Hans! Are you deaf? - Did you call me, sir? - I can't wait forever! I need money. The farmers have to pay right now! - But I'm not done. - Cut it out. - We need flour. We're out of bread. - But, sir! Shut up and work! - He's unbelievably lazy. - How true. Life is full of funny things. But I have to say, Mr. Kunz, your stories are really quite unique. Well, I am miller Kunz, after all. And I've come up in the world. Cheers. Isn't this fun? Drinking, talking, boasting. The King's levy can wait, eh? - But chancellor, sir, I was just... - Silence! All you do is talk and drink! Get working. You owe money. Chancellor, sir... - We... The miller and me... - Fiddlesticks! He's a blasted loafer. Trying to cheat the King. And you're keeping him working! I'm out of money right now. But don't worry, sir. The farmers are down there in the mill. They can pay now. I'll be there in a minute. I'm on my way. I'm running. Come up here. Coming. There, sir, it's being taken care of. Take a seat. A goblet, sir? A goblet of wine? Stop prattling and get the levy! See where Hans is. Oh I'm sorry, but... - But what? - You called, sir? I did indeed. Because you're so lazy. Even His Majesty has to wait! But I work all day. It's true, sir. But it's too much for me alone. Too much, you say! That's all I need! Maybe that'll help. Try working yourself. His Majesty wants his levy. At once, sir. My joints all hurt so much! My arms! My legs! My hands! - I can't walk! - But talk and drink! I've had enough! Get that money or else! - You heard him. Move! - I'm going. - But what I said was true... - Out! - He's gone. - What a sloth. Believe me, sir. - Without me... - Without you! You just drink, boast and tell lies. - Me, a liar? - The whole kingdom knows it! Get up and pay your levy! Not one penny! - Yes, but he needs cash. - And we need flour. - Our children are starving. - He needs it now. - Get working. - He'll be locked up. - It'd serve him right. - He deserves it. It's his problem. Then tell those shabby idiots I don't need their lousy money! - You don't need it? - No I don't. I have enough. Got enough, you say? So where's His Majesty's levy? I want that money now! - I can't do it. - What about your daughter... - Forget it! - What's this? Has she hid your money? Explain! What about her and your money? She can spin. You too, Kunz. A web of lies. Any girl can do that. That doesn't make you rich. But she can spin... Gold! She spins gold thread out of straw! She spins gold thread? Out of dirty, worthless straw? Be careful what you say, Kunz. Gold, I tell you. Pure, shining gold. As true as my name is Kunz. But it has to be full moon, darkest midnight and full moon. You're talking utter rubbish! Full moon or not, the main thing is that it's midnight. All is quiet. An owl hoots. What do you want now? We're at work. - The farmers... - Forget them, tell him it's true. - Yes, the farmers... - That Marie spins gold out of straw. Gold? Out of straw? Not "aha", sir. He'll remember all right. You've seen it, haven't you? At night. When there's a full moon. I saw her lately by moonlight. She was spinning in her room. - Her hair shone. Her room glowed... - Like gold! - No. - Believe me, sir. Marie can do it. The farmers bring me grain. I mill it. - And Marie spins gold out of straw! - But... - Sir... - Quiet! You wait, Kunz, you bigmouth. I'll get you for this. Well, if Hans has seen it too we have to believe it. Not a word. - Prove it first. - Prove it? Couldn't be easier. Very well. - I shall tell the King about all this. - The King? Yes. Him. Where is the girl? My daughter, Marie? Yes. Where is she? - Up there? - Yes. Up in town is where she is. Both of you come to the castle. There she will spin gold from straw. But she needs a full moon to do it. A fine, round full moon. - But it is full moon. - A fine round shining full moon. It's full moon tonight, you say? A beautifully round full moon? We shall send for you later in the day. God help you if you're lying. God help you if you're lying! Turn, wheel, turn, Purring like a cat. No time to rest Or for things like that. Girls keep spinnin' Cloth and pure linen. Turn, wheel, turn, Purring... You want to play blindman's buff? Marie, your father, chancellor... Just take a deep breath. Your father said you should spin the tax collector... Tell me more! Your father said you should... There he is. My child! My gold child! My golden girl. Busy spinning? Good. That's the way. You'll soon be spinning gold. Fine, shining gold! Father, what do you mean? - What about gold? - Can't you spin it? Gold out of straw. Any old straw. Of course you can. I've told the chancellor. And he's going to tell the King. Hans. Is it true? The miller told the neighbor and chancellor that. - Hans agreed. - No. But I can't do that! You know that perfectly well. Marie. Are you saying I'm a liar? You'll ruin me! You will go there and spin that gold! But I can't, Father. Nobody can do it! - Why do you tell all these lies? - Me, a liar? We'll see about that! We'll see about that! If only I'd told the truth. What will the King do? And then he said she could spin gold out of straw. It can't be true. You can't turn straw into gold. Even a child knows that. How could you be fooled by that? Of course it can't be true. I agree. The miller's notorious for his lying. So why all this talk? I'm bored with it. You're bored because you can't afford a fine court. Unfortunately, you're right. My father left empty coffers instead of great wealth. So how can I have a fine court? - The miller's girl will help us. - Don't start that all over again! We'd be rich if it were true. But of course the miller's lying. We'll take his mill for that. That'll bring the money in. I agree. That's a royal command. Jot this down: I, the King, order miller Kunz to come to the castle at the... - the next full moon. - Next full moon. In other words, tomorrow night. His daughter will spin gold out of straw for us. If she fails... she will bejailed in a prison and we will impound the miller's mill. Give me that. Take this to the miller. Get the miller. And be quick. As you wish. Stop! Come back. I can't waste my time. Give the miller the King's orders. Or your head will roll! Marie's in hot water now. Miller Kunz! Marie! Come on! Don't worry! Father! Show us what you can do. Tell him the truth. You'll ruin us. Don't listen to her. "Ruin" indeed! Just the opposite, my gold child. The miller and his daughter, sire. You can spin gold out of straw? If you can't you know what will happen. Majesty, I beg you, please. - I can't do it. - Is your father a liar then? They'll take the mill. But, Father... - Sire... - Off you go. There's the straw and wheel. You heard him! She'll start right now, sire. Right now. She has to be alone. Fair enough, we'll go. I'll be back in the morning to check. She can do it! She really can! Well, is she spinning away? She can't do it. She can! It's true... Really? We'll see in the morning. I'll never do it. What am I going to do? Good evening, Marie. Why are you crying? Who on earth are you? Don't worry. I've come to help you. Nobody can help me, friend. I have to spin all this... into gold! - I know. - You know that? I know that lies and greed are wicked. So I want to help you. I'll spin this straw into gold. But I can't give you anything! You can see that. If you have something you're very fond of I'll be quite happy. - This necklace? - Thank you. Now let's get to work! You hand me the straw. I'll sit there and spin it. One, two, three. Straw will change for me. Two, three, four. Coins on the floor. Three, four, five and more. Give me straw. Four, five, six. Pretty simple tricks. Five, six, seven. Soon to be eleven. Six, seven, eight. Owl hoots late. Don't you hesitate! Seven, eight, nine. Sounds really fine. Eight, nine, ten. Golden coins again. Now I've changed straw untold Into highest carat gold. Because of the lies the miller told! It's true! It's all gold. How can I ever thank you? He's gone. I didn't even find out his name. I'm sure she's done it, I'm telling you. Sure as my name is Kunz. I hope so. For your own sake! As true as my name is Kunz. What can you see? Gold. Sparkling, shining gold! - Shining gold! - Gold! - It's gold, sire! - Shining gold. Look. Fine, shiny gold! It's true. Gold! You see. I wasn't lying. My Marie. My gold child. She managed! Demand more straw, sire. Then she can make more gold. - More gold? - We need it. She'll do it! You're right. Miller's daughter... Return at sunset and make more gold. - Spare me please. I can't do it. - Can't do it? But Marie! - Don't listen to her. - It's true. But this is gold, isn't it? Kunz, you will both return tonight. And she'd better spin more gold or she'll be thrown into prison. - And we'll take your mill. - Yes. My dear little mill? Come on, Father. Twice as much gold tomorrow! Hurry up! It all has to be there by sunset. Hurry up! What am I going to do? Here I am again! You look so surprised. Look at all this straw. The King thinks gold is the most precious thing in life. And your father is still lying! But I must help him, even so. What'll you give me if I spin gold again? Here, this ring. It's all I have left. But you can have it if you help me. You're good. I'll help you. But now we have to get going! One, two, three. Straw will change for me. Two, three, four. Coins on the floor. Three, four, five and more. Give me straw. Four, five, six. Pretty simple tricks. Five, six, seven. Quick, it's past eleven! Up to eight. Owl hoots late. Don't hesitate! Seven, eight, nine. Sounds really fine. Eight, nine, ten. Golden coins again. I've spun straw into gold. What a wonder to behold! Because the miller lies has told And the King has craved more gold! I'm so happy! How can I ever thank you? He's gone again! Thank you, dear little elf! I'm so tired. So she did it! There's much more, too. Real gold again. Just look, Majesty. Pure gold. Now I can fill the coffers. Wake the miller's daughter up. Where am I? Where's the little elf? What? The King's speaking to you! Come here, Marie. Demand more gold! I am content, Marie. This evening you will spin a pile of straw into gold. Three times higher than the last one. But I shall reward you. You are so pretty and I like you so I'll make you my wife. Tomorrow after you have spun the gold. But if you fail you and your father will suffer. - They're ordered to the castle again? - Don't ask me. I'm busy. I say Marie has spun gold from straw. The miller will return in a golden carriage. Royal command. Bring all the straw in the land to the castle. Anyone who holds any back will go to prison. - What does the King want it all for? - You didn't believe it! Who'd have thought that straw could be worth so much! You heard the King's order. Beware! Not a single straw is to remain here. Faster! Faster! Turn this straw here to gold tonight. You know what's at stake. Do it and you'll be Queen. Don't you have enough yet? - Sire, please spare me! - Get on with it! Your Majesty! - It's you! - Marie! Over here! You just wait. I'll find you! I'm over here! The laugh's on me. Look at all this straw. I see it all. Tomorrow you will be crowned Queen. I don't even want to be Queen. It's all for my father's sake. Please help me again. And what will I get? It's going to be a lot of work. I have nothing left to give you. When you're Queen promise me your first-born. - Who can tell the future? - That's not your problem. All right, I promise. When a year has passed I will come for your child. One, two, three and more. Weighing it today's in store. Three, four, five. Dawn's soon here. I get your child in just one year. Turn it into gold, make it shine. Your little baby will be mine! Time is fast. A year's soon past. Day has come. Cock-a-doodle-done. Night three now its course has run. Today you become Queen. Remember, I'll be back next year To take your child far from here. Wait! I didn't thank him and I still don't know his name. More gold. From now on I am your loyal servant. Your Majesty. I am keeping my word. You have performed your chore. So I am making you my wife and Queen of my country. Where are you going? What do you want in the castle? Don't you know me? I'm miller Kunz's neighbor. I used to visit him every day. So what? You need permission from the King or chancellor. I was there when the chancellor first came to the mill. He even spoke to me. Miller Kunz must be expecting me. - Hey, miller Kunz! - You there, get lost! Or isn't it you after all? You will seek miller Kunz in vain. I am the young Queen's father. But yes, I do remember you. Truly, a lot has changed in one year. You've become a man of standing. - Are you all right? - Certainly! I am the King's top advisor. I lack nothing. Look how well dressed I am! Not even the King has such fine shoes. - And so dainty. - Indeed. But wait till you see my daughter! Her child is beautiful. The happiest, smartest child in the whole world. - Like you, her grandpa. - Yes. Go to sleep, close those eyes so wide. Into a dream may you softly glide. The wind will gently close the eyes Of the tranquil dear I so idolize. - What do you want? - You know. It's been exactly a year since we met. One, two, three. Here am I. Four, five, six. The hours went by. Baby's mine when the time is high. The year is over. No. I can't give you my child. And your promise? Take all the treasures I have. Gold and precious stones. But please, not my baby. Only humans think wealth makes you happier. I don't need your treasures. It's a promise and so I'm taking it. I don't want it to grow up among folk who treasure gold above all. I didn't want the gold. - I did it for the King. - You're living like a Queen. I'd gladly give it all up... just to keep my baby. All right. I feel sorry for you. So I'll wait three days. If you figure out my name by then you may keep your baby. How can I do that? There are so many names. Hans, Konrad, Kaspar... - Heinrich? - No. I have a most uncommon name. It'll be very difficult. I'll be back the same time tomorrow. "A most uncommon name." I don't understand it. What's the matter, child? Are you sad? Look at me. Getting fatter, lazier and more aristocratic every day. New clothes every day. A new hairstyle and a new pair of shoes as well. Shame on you, Father! Prancing about proud as a peacock! But why shouldn't I? We're doing so well. Where's my sweet... You're happy. But your lies have ruined me! "Ruined" indeed! You're beautiful, you're rich. What's the matter, my gold child? Can I help you? If you want to help me tell me all the names you know. But not common ones. Names? Names? That's no problem at all. If that's all you need! I know at least one thousand... six hundred... ninety-seven. For example... Emma, or Minna. But they'rejust common girl's names. Well then, what about Mincemeat? Or Bag'o'Bones? What ideas you have! Or Longnose. Stringlegs. Drizzlesnuff. There, my gold child, that's what you like, isn't it? I need lots. Do you know any more? Oh yes, yes... No, I don't really. Ask people in the castle their names. - Then come back and tell me. - Of course, my gold child. At once. I'm running. I'm flying. I'll find out his name. Longnose. Stringlegs. Life is so boring these days. Now that the miller's gone. He always had such good wine! Nobody else had such good wine. - And cheap as well, wasn't it? - You're just a rogue, old friend. - Didn't he leave a single cask? - All he left me was work. You seem to be in a bad mood today. It's a shame you're so unfriendly. Now I can't tell you anything about Queen Marie's terrible troubles. What's that? Marie has troubles? - Tell me more, neighbor. - Now, now. Well, that's what she gets for marrying a greedy King. I didn't hear that. Our King is a kind master. I'm not sure what happened. I really don't know a thing. They say she had a mysterious visitor. - And then she wept for hours. - A visitor? I don't really know anything and I said nothing. - But they say it was a little elf. - And what does he want? The Queen has to perform a feat but can't. Now let me go. I said enough already. What happened in the castle? I reckon Marie needs a friend. Well, can you tell me my name? Did you guess it? - Is it Stringlegs? - No. - Is it Mincemeat? - No. - Is it Drizzlesnuff? - No. - Muttonshank? - No. - Ironbite? - No. You won't guess it. My name isn't like those. - I'll be back tomorrow and you'll... - Wait, tell me how I can find it out. You'll never do it alone. You'll have to tell the truth. That you didn't spin that gold. Then help will come. Tomorrow I'll return for the last time. What's the matter? Aren't you happy? You have everything you could desire. You only married me because you think I can spin gold. That means more to you than our child. What makes you say that? I love our child too. And if it were taken from you? What are you talking about? Nobody's going to take our child. Oh yes they are! A little elf will come for it. What? A little elf? Our child? What's a little elf got to do with our child? The little elf helped me when I was in great need. That time when you ordered me to spin gold out of straw. He did it for me three nights in a row! What are you saying? You didn't do it yourself? No. My father was lying to you. I can't turn straw into gold. The little elf did it to save us. I had to give him something each night. The last night I had nothing left. I had to promise him my first-born. I have to keep it. He's coming tomorrow. That can't happen. I love our child too. At first you loved your gold and treasure more. Now you suddenly realize you love your child. Forgive me, Marie. I'll do all I can to keep our child. If we learn the man's name before he comes, our child is safe. We'll find out the name. If only Hans from the mill were here. He's a good friend. - Your Majesty... - Summon all the people in the castle. Cheer up. It'll be all right. Whatever happened? Who saw him? The Queen was weeping? The King. I called you from all over the castle because we need your help. A tragedy threatens the Queen and me. We have been tasked with performing a difficult feat. We can't do it alone. We need the name of a little elf. Set off to the towns and villages and ask everyone for unusual names. Look for the little elf. Report your findings to the Queen. I'll look too. Saddle my best horse. All those who help us can take as much gold as they wish. Think it over! Silence! Our child is more important than all the gold in the world. Let us set off. We have to know his name by tomorrow. Queen Marie! - Stop! - I have to see the Queen! What do you want? Away with you! Away with you, chancellor! Hans is my friend. - I'm happy you're here. I need you. - I heard you had troubles. - You can help me. - What do I have to do? Go into the forest where nobody else goes. The deep forest. Look for a little elf. Try to learn his name. When you have it, return at once. Yes, Marie. I mean Mrs. Marie Queen. I'm on my way. I'm happy to help. I'll find him. I'll find him. Hey, you, come here. I have an important question. - What's your name? - You already know. Klaus. - And your father's name? - His name was Konrad. Two very fine names, for sure. But they are of no use to me. - That's all I can do. - Can I go now? Go. Leave Limpy alone! - What did you say? - Give Limpy back to me. - Limpy? - Yes. Nice name. Evening. - Evening. - Does a little elf live in this wood? - One with a funny name. - I know nothing. Welcome, Ladies! Have a look and take your pick! - You must have heard a lot. - Yes. - Know an odd-named little elf? - Little elf? There he is, Mere Trifle! Let me help you carry that. You're a good man. - How can I thank you? - That's easy. Do you know a strange, unusual name? - Wait. Do you know... - What do you want? One of those wandering snoopers? I don't know any names. Do you know any unusual name which nobody else has? What a strange question, my lord. I would be glad to help you. - But I can't think of any. - Can I sleep here? I don't know where else to go. If you don't mind my cottage among leaves and branches. I'm almost done. It'll be the finest cradle I ever saw. I wonder if Marie will guess my name. I don't think so. Then I'll get her child. And it will grow up here uncorrupted by the power of gold. Humans cheated me out of my riches and made me suffer. Yet I often helped them when they needed it. But they always deceived me. Marie, too, became a liar because of riches. She won't find out my name. Tomorrow the child will be mine! Today I'm baking. Today I'm brewing. Tomorrow Queen's child I'll be taking! Nobody knows, to my delight, I'm Rumpelstiltskin day and night! A cottage. Today I'm baking. Today I'm brewing. Tomorrow Queen's child I'll be taking! Nobody knows, to my delight, I'm Rumpelstiltskin day and night! "I'm Rumpelstiltskin"? Rumpelstiltskin. He must be the little elf Marie talked about! I have to tell her right away! I met an old woman. She told me she once knew a man whose name was Muttonshank. Thank you. But that's not the right name either. My gold child! I have it! I found the right name. Then tell me, Father! I ran around the whole day and asked so many people. What were their names? Buttercup, Forget-me-not, Catspaw, Daisy, Larkspore. They are all names of flowers. Where can you meet such people? - You're lying again! - Leave us, Miller. And the rest of you too. We shall wait for the elf alone. Only Hans can help us now. Where can he be? The little elf will be here any minute. Your Majesty! I was... - The forest... the little elf! - Hans! Calm down! Tell us about it! I walked deep in the woods for hours. Then I saw... it was so dark... - I thought I was dreaming... - Calm down, take a deep breath. - Now tell us. - Suddenly I saw a fire. A little elf danced around it. He sang, Today I'm baking, today I'm brewing. Tomorrow Queen's child I'll be taking! Nobody knows, to my delight, I'm Rumpelstiltskin day and night! That's the name, for sure! Well, what's my name? Do you know it this time, Your Majesty? Is it... Brownie? No. That's not my name. Is it... Hellebore? No! - Is it... Gobbledygook? - No. Not that either. Could it be... Rumpelstiltskin? Is your name really Rumpelstiltskin? Yes, that's my name. But did you guess my name yourself? - Of course you did. - Of course you did. No, Rumpelstiltskin. It was Hans. He helped me. Nobody knows, to my delight, I'm Rumpelstiltskin day and night! You performed the feat, Marie. I see you truly love your child. And that you, King, are cured of your greed. That's why Hans and the others helped you. And I have to keep my promise. Thank you, Rumpelstiltskin. Stay here as long as you like. Yes. Live here with us. I can't. I'm going back to my forest. You won't be needing me any more as long as you love each other and never lie again for the sake of gold. - Where did he go? - Yes. Where is he? You won't find him. - He always vanished like that. - What? I'm here! I found the right name. I forgot it. You're too late. Hans found the right name. So now he has a wish coming. As punishment for his lies, I want the lazy miller to go back to the mill. And for every lie he told and tells he must grind the poor a sack of flour. - For free! - Quite right, Hans! - And you can help him! - So it shall be! Back to the mill? Work again? Now that I've become so fat and lazy? And so aristocratic. Serves you right! Crime must be paid for! True! Your crimes also deserve payment, chancellor! Your bad counsel caused such trouble that you are hereby banished. But Hans should stay here with us. As our counselor. He'll help us to do what is right. I'll try, Your Majesty. I'll do my best.
