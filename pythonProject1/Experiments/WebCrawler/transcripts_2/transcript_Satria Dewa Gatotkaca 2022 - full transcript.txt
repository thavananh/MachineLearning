This is madness. What happened? It hasn't been a month but they found another victim! What? Are you sure? "A 10 years-old boy, who is a Physics Olympiad medalist!" Physics… -He must've been smart. -True, and then why… But, love, is there any other victim, other than this boy? Of course there's another victim! The female virologist who developed the Corona and MERS vaccine. She was found dead in her laboratory. Oh, God! Poor her! -How much is it? -Yeah? Fifty. Already with the emping chips? All of that 50,000 rupiahs, right? -Excuse me. -Sure. Go away, Dursasana! Go away! Pande! -What's wrong with her? -Pande! Yuda's mother always behaves like that. Her mother is crazy. She always becomes a disturbance. Go away, Burisrawa! Leave us! Go! Mom, get down please. Come here. Do not come here! It's dangerous! I bought your favorite chips! Here, your favorite. I'll give it to you but please get down. And give me the painting. I'll give you the emping, but give me the painting first. Yeah, here, let me help you. That's right. Come here. You can sit here. Yes, just throw it up! It's done. Her again, Neighborhood Chief! It's wayang. Chief, let me. -Yuda! -Yuda! Yud-- -The Chief's looking for you. -He's coming out, Chief. Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for disturbing your leisure time tonight. I hope you all could understand my mother's condition. I promise this would be the last time. And I will pay the rest of the rent. Listen, Yuda. I didn't come here because of the rent that's always late, but-- Come on, Chief! This is both about the late payment, and how they always disturb us! -They always give us trouble, right? -That's right! As the chief of the neighborhood, you should listen to what we're saying! -That's true! -That's true! Listen to me carefully, Yuda. Die! I only… I could only give you 150,000 rupiah at the moment. Here, this is all I got. Please give me at least a week. -Three days. -Yeah, three days. -Three days is more than enough. Alright? -Yes, three days. -Three days, okay? -Yes. We should all go home now. -Let's go home. -Go home, everyone. Drona died! Yud… Are you having an argument with Gledek Gluduk? You are viral now! What do you mean viral? Check bibirjuliid on Instagram. Hold on. It's all up to me! Who are you to boss me around? At least have some class. You mean I'm not classy? You dare to talk back to me? That bastard! He said he won't upload this video! You don't want to interview someone who only wants to be viral, right? That's right. He may have a million subscribers, but his content has zero impact. Erlangga. It's almost 8 o'clock, why are you still watering the plant? -Give me two minutes. -Quickly! My gosh. Er. I think I need your help. Of course I will help. But, I need to get ready for my graduation. -Mom's been pestering me since morning. -What? -Today is your graduation? -Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? I'll come as your photographer. Are you serious?

Aren't the photographer already handled by the committee? I only want to help him, dad. And you know how he is. He could be thrown out of his rented house, again. -Again? -Who's being thrown out? It seems that friend of yours always needed help. Honey, please. Mom. I'll go out for a moment. Thank you God, finally we are free. It feels like yesterday. There he is. You already graduated!

Good afternoon, graduates. -Afternoon. -Afternoon. The Honorable Mr. Basudana. The head of Barata Astinapura Foundation, and Mrs. Basudana. I always tell the younger generation, whoever feels they are special and has abilities, do not let your arrogance eat you. Do not feel superior. Because all of that is going to be the main factor of your falling. I also told this to Agni, my daughter who always makes me proud Always keep your spirit on, and never give up. And now we will hear a speech from Agni Perwita Laksana. One of our Valedictorians, who gets a summa cum laude. Congratulations, my fellow graduates. The real fight is just beginning All of our assignments, tests, and thesis, are only a practice for the real world. We all need to keep-- Erlangga! -Erlangga! -Erlangga! Erlangga! Rector! Erlangga? Erlangga! -Erlangga! -Dear! -Erlangga! -Agni, run! Erlangga! Erlangga… Erlangga! -Ambulance! Call the ambulance! -Erlangga! Ambulance! Please call the ambulance! Help, please! Please call the ambulance! Call the ambulance! Sir, are you okay? Sir? There's a shadow running that way. Who are you? Erlangga. Who is Erlangga? Who is Erlangga? Who is Erlangga? Erlangga, Mom. Erlangga. Erlangga is my best friend, who always help us. The one who always bring your favorite chips. Mom, you can forget anyone… but not Erlangga. Don't forget him. Investigation of the mysterious death that happened a few weeks ago has not been concluded. However, today, we found another victim who died the same way. Erlangga Pratama, a graduate from Barata Astinapura University. was found dead this morning in the middle of his campus' graduation ceremony. The police are still looking for the culprit. But, an anonymous video shows something that is hard to believe. Kaurava… In order to know the details, we will interview one of the witnesses who is also the Rector of Barata Astinapura University. Professor Arya Laksana. What actually happened, Professor? The perpetrator was really strong. He lifted the victim with one hand. Does the killer has the special gene like what you mentioned in your thesis? Yes, I think so. But his blood is not from Pandava gene Like the name, Pandava has a trait to build and improve. not to look for trouble. But there's a powerful gene that likes to destroy things. What kind of gene is that, Professor? Kaurava. The nemesis of Pandava. -Kaurava taken from the word "Kuru"… -What you said earlier, Mom? …which means the one who starts. The perpetrators. In conclusion, you think that Kaurava's gene is the culprit? Pande! We need a deeper investigation before we can answer that question. Alright. So, what kind of investigation that we need to do, Professor? -Pande! -There is no Pande, Mom. He left us, Mom. Pande is the one who you should forget! Pande! -Mom… -Pande… Traitor! CONDOLENCES Yuda, could you give us some comment about the figure you met yesterday? -Thank you. -No worries. Who is that, Yuda? The one who always appears in my dream. Are you sure it's only a dream? They said, you have the same dreams over and over again, it could be a sign, you know? What kind of a sign? How should I know? You're the one who dreams it, so you should interpret it yourself. Excuse me, Professor Arya could you give me a moment? Excuse me. We need your opinion about the victim, Professor. My condolences, sir, madam. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Excuse me. Professor… What are you doing? Move! It's okay, Nathan. Sorry, Professor. I'm Yuda, Erlangga's best friend. I also used to be one of your students. But he's a dropout now, Professor. He could not pay the tuition! -Nathan! -My condolences, Yuda. It must've been hard for you. I heard that you ran after the perpetrator. -That's right, Professor. -You shouldn't try to be a hero! This is a police matter. Actually, this also concerns my mother. She had amnesia for a long time. But yesterday, I saw something different about her. She said something about Kaurava when she saw the killer on TV. Professor, is it true that Pandava and Kaurava exist? If you're curious about that, come to my house. You know where I live, right? Thank you, Professor. Move! Thank you. Don't mention it. My thesis is talking about the unique behavior of people that has grown rapidly in the past few years. The uniqueness in their blood is genetics and has a lot of kinds. The one I encounter the most is Pandava's gene. So, Pandava and Kaurava are real. They exist. Thousands or even million years ago. -Agni. -Yes, dad? Could you please hand me the History of Mankind map? Wait a minute. Professor, if they are real, why have we never heard of them in our history? "History is written by victors." That's what Winston Churchill said. And he quoted it from Napoleon. You're right. Something written in one note could be different in another note. Which one is true? We don't really know. Have you ever imagined if the victor is the wrong person? And then, we believe the history written by him. Pandava, Kaurava, Rakshasa, and Devata. They existed 3,000 years Before Christ. They are children of Adam, like us. The only difference is they have a connection to Kadewatan. Kadewatan? The world of gods. With Lord Shiva alias Batara Guru as the supreme god. That's right. At that time, humans and gods have direct relationships. If Pandava and Kaurava exist that means… We are the descendants. It runs in our blood. Our gene. What about Erlangga? Does he… have the gene… of Pandava? Based on his good upbringing, honesty, I'm sure he has the Pandava's gene. I watch your interview on TV yesterday. While being interviewed, you said that Pandava is the nemesis of Kaurava. But it seemed you didn't want to point out that the killer was Kaurava. Because Kaurava's gene is rare, Yuda. I once met a Kaurava's gene in India. He's a very old man. He could take his own kidney without any procedure just to sell it. Taking, seizing, stealing, and coercing. All of those are Kaurava's traits. Does Kaurava have the ability to hurt people? Pandava also has the ability to hurt. However, Kaurava is more likely to take something away. Then, maybe Kaurava is the one who took my mother's memory. It's possible. If your mother ever met them. Theoretically, whoever your mother's memory he's the one who has it. And if he had your mother's memory, he also could give it back to her. So, that's not a dream. What is your mother's name? Arimbi. And where do you live? In the suburbs. I would like to give back all of Erlangga's belonging that I borrowed before. You could put it in his room. Oh my god, I'm very embarrassed. I couldn't do it. I was scared! Just talk to her, you know? Come on, Erlangga. You have money, also one of the smartest kids. Rank one in the entire school! And yet, you don't have the guts to ask a girl out? You could just say it! "Sharpen your heart, so you're sharp enough to catch the sign." Practice until your heart understands it. What are you doing here? And what about you? Pretending to return all Erlangga's belonging. I am returning all his belongings! And also searching his room to look for clue about the culprit? I have the same lecturer as Erlangga. He said he has a journal. But he never showed it to me. You're his best friend, right? Even if I know, that's not your business. Erlangga is not the first victim, Yuda. And what does it have to do with me? If I'm not the first one to give speech, then maybe, I'm the one who's dead. So you think you're special, and they will come after you? Just go home, Agni. Not until you tell me where's his hiding spot. Not gonna happen. My father has a Kaurava's genetics map! You could use it to find a clue about the one who took your mother's memory. I could give it to you for free. Erlangga might be my best friend, but it doesn't mean he tells me all his secrets. How do you know the meaning of those words? I read Serat Wulangreh on daily basis. What book is that? You said you read Serat Wulangreh on daily basis. You can read Javanese script? Since I was a kid. My mom used to teach me. "Voila Paris." "13 September." "Four o'clock." In an hour. You're the cameraman who has an argument with Gledek Gluduk, right? The one who Gledek called uneducated fellow? -Quinn! -What? Nothing's wrong with my question. It's important to know his background. Don't you have better thing to do other than investigate me? Your status is minus. Financially also minus. And, you have know-it-all personality. Agni, be careful with people like him. They're usually dangerous. What time is it now? What the hell? Don't touch her that long! I only wanna see the time. I gotta go. I need to take care of my mother. -Go to the car, now. -Hey! Agni… Agni. Hey, Pandava! Don't run! What are you doing? Hey! -Hey! -Hey! Bang! Hey! My gosh. This is my broom! Choose another spot to fight! Don't do it here! This is expensive, you know? -Yes, we're sorry. -Sorry. -Sorry, ma'am. -Sorry. You move, you die. -Freeze! -Come on! -Who are you? -Come on! Hurry, Ge! I know! This way! Do not move! Come on! Hello? I already told you the address. The front of Mripat Lawas. -An antique store. -Ma'am. Mother, could you please open the door? I already send you the location! Whatever! Slowly. Come in. -What is this place? Why…? -Come here! Oh, my God, it's a door? Google maps directed me here. Is this the right place? Watch it! Don't fall! Okay. Oh, my God! Have a drink first. Where am I? Who are you, people? I'm Gege. This is my big brother. Dananjaya. He's Pandava to the bone. Why? You don't believe that I'm a Pandava? This is Madam Surti Ray. She's our adoptive mother. We often call her Mother Mripat because her eyes are very keen if she sees an heirloom. This antique store is hers. Is she also a Pandava? She is not. She's Kaurava. Bro, take it easy. You must think all the Kaurava are evil, right? They're not. Kaurava's traits are taking, destroying, and absorbing. If you do it for good, you could use those traits to help people. That's not possible, kid. There is no Kaurava in this city. That's based on the research that has been run for the past five years. Maybe your father didn't investigate it thoroughly. You know who my father is? Arya Laksana, right? A rector, an observer of culture, history, and mythology. He has only one daughter, Agni Prawita Laksana. A summa cum laude graduate of literature and culture faculty who is preparing her post-graduate thesis about the connection between humans and myth. -Right? -Did you hack my blog? Are you a hacker? Your data and identity are safe with us. Besides yours, we also have the data about Pandava and Kaurava that live millions of years ago. -We have it all. -That's not possible. That story is deliberately covered. They believe it was a myth. Even my father went to Haryana in North India to look for all the data. You only play games! You don't know anything! Just so you know, where do you think this woman, who takes care of your cameraman friend, comes from? Mrs. Mripat also comes from Haryana. Only a Kaurava can do that. -Taking out the poison with bare hands. -Poison? Cool, right? Madam, don't you think the wound needs to be stitched? The stab wound is quite deep. They use an ax, ma'am. Based on… Based on what I see, are you also the one who uploaded my fighting video with the Figure? -Ge, give it back to him. -Hold on. -Here's your camera. -We are also the ones who take you home. Why did you guys help us? We're all Erlangga's friends. That's right. Not only do we help you, but we also help ourselves. If only your movement is not suspicious, we won't do this. Now, do you understand? The wound heals fast! Ge, get the water! Don't bother. We're not that thirsty. We just gonna go. -You talk too much! -Have you ever been sick before? Dengue, typhus, smallpox, or just common flu? No, never. I've never been sick since I was a kid. Drink this holy water. You are insane! You guys think I'm stupid? I won't drink it! Why the hassle just to drink this? It's safe, right? Drink it. It's salty! What kind of water is this? -What kind of necklace is that? -A magic heirloom. It's called Maya. Shush now. Bro, they have the same aura as Erlangga! They're all Pandava! Bro! -Can't you take it easy? -They have the same aura, right? What do you mean Pandava? You mean Pandava in those wayang stories? Of course, Aunty! You were just born yesterday, and you already mock me? Hers is purple. What is that? Maybe a dragonfruit. Hey, watch your mouth! Agni! Let's go home! These guys are crazy! Wait a minute. Everybody, Mrs. Mripat said we don't have much time. We need to find an heirloom for you two to fight the Kaurava. Come on. Wait! Hold on. I don't really understand what you guys are talking about. I don't understand. I went there because I wanted to know what Erlangga had been doing. That's all, okay? I'll show you something to make you understand what's going on. Listen to this. Hello. Whoever watches this video… you need to believe one thing. The end of the world is getting near at the end of 2022. Let me explain it to you. What I mean by the end of the world is the awakening of Kaurava and the fall of Pandava. Thousands of years ago, there was a civil war between Pandava and Kaurava families. It's known as Bharatayuddha. The gods deliberately started the war to cleanse the universe from the greedy people who would destroy the world. That's why Pandava is chosen to be the winner. But Aswatama, the last commander of Kaurava, can't accept the decisions. And he takes out the forbidden weapon called Narayanastra to kill the Pandava's family. To protect the Pandava, the weapon was debilitated. And because of his action, the gods punish Aswatama by taking his power that come from a gemstone and locking him in Patala's dimension until the world's end. Fifteen years ago, a meteorite fell in the north of Astinapura City. And many believe it was Aswatama's gemstone who deliberately dropped by the Devatas to start a war in the present time. The awakening of Kaurava could be seen with the destruction of the world, forest logging, corruption, and the intentional pandemic. Not only that, so many lives of Pandava have been sacrificed for the liberation of Aswatama. To stop the movement of Kaurava, the government secretly create Yoddha Pandava, the protector of Pandava. However, the politicians and state officials with Kaurava's gene have opposed this organization. The organization is considered radicalism among the young generation. Because of the urge of the Parliament, most likely a Kaurava, Yoddha Pandava was disbanded. They consider it a forbidden organization, and the officials who support Yoddha Pandava live in fear. Some of them are even suspiciously missing. Ultimately, Kaurava could freely look for the best Pandava for Aswatama's freedom. Major changes are going to happen. I think… Aswatama will rise again and will take revenge on all Pandava. The Kaurava has hacked this project. That's why they took a bold step. Your presence is catching their attention. Agni, let's go home! This is crazy! -Then, why are you guys still here? -What did you expect from us? What do you want to do now? Just so you know, I was sitting next to Erlangga before they killed him! I'm probably next! And you think I'm not? Without Erlangga, I won't continue the project. I don't want any more victims. Agni, wait up! -Where's the car? -Wait a minute. -Quinn, where's the car? -It's on that side. Do you want to stop me too? Calm down. Do not take their words. Can't you stop talking about that? Enough, Agni. Let's go If you want, we can face it together. Thank you for protecting me. I'd like to ask you one question. If we are the descendants of Pandava and Kaurava… does our gene related to our parents? Yes, based on what my dad said. -Agni! -Where are you going? -I need to see my mother. -I'll drop you off. -Wait… -Where's the car? Come on. Wait, where are you…? Hey! Sir! What the hell? Mr. Pecut… What's going on? Why are you doing here? -You said you give me three days. -I thought it's already been three days. -Where's my mom? -She left. -Mom! -She has already left! -Mother! -You punk. -You just want to make me angry. -Where's my mother? Your mother… TETUKA HILL You can read, right? H-I-L-L. Hill. Yuda, doesn't your mother lose her memory? So then, why can she write? I don't know. Usually, she can't even eat by herself. There must be something else before we arrived. She doesn't have any enemies, right? Agni. Wait up, Agni. Agni! I'm serious. Yuda, are you sure you used to live here? Since I was seven. What did your father do? He was in the Police Intelligence, but he was dismissed. Because he ran away with his supervisor's daughter, my mother. Help! Help me! Please, help me! Help! Agni. Mom? -Mom! -Yuda, help me. -Mom! -Yuda… Your memories are back. Mom? Mom! What's wrong? -We have to get out from here. -Let's take her to the car. We have to get out from here. Arimbi. Yuda, don't! Give me the Brajamusti. Or do you want me to retake your memory? Give me the soul of Pandava and the Brajamusti. For the rise of Kaurava from the loss! Mother! Yuda, don't! Mom! Yuda! Agni, run! Mother! Yuda, are you alright? Mom. Mom. Mom, please. Yuda… Mom. Please, do not leave me, mom. Please, hang on. I'm sorry. Don't leave me, mom. This is my karma, Yuda, for leaving your grandparents. Please, Mom. Don't leave me. I save you the heirloom. Take it. It's in your brother's grave. Mom. Take care of it, protect it… and don't let it fall to the wrong person, got it? Mom… Mom, please… Mom! Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. This letter can be read as… "Su." What is this? "La." "Di." Put the feather on the top of the letter Na. So? "Ni." Now, read it. "Sura Dira Jayaningrat." That's right. You have a brother? No. Then, what your mother means by your brother's grave? She means his umbilical cord. Javanese people believe a baby that comes to this world has two siblings. The amniotic fluids and their umbilical cord. -"Kakang Kawah Adi Ari-ari." -That's right. What's that? Arimbi. That's the Brajamusti medal. Didn't they already take the medal? It must've been the fake one. If it's true, then this is an inheritance from your ancestors. That means you have the special gene. What? Gatotkaca. If it's true that you are Gatotkaca, that means you are the chosen one. You're the one who will protect all of the Pandavas. Agni, look at this! Nathan is being possessive! He texts me all the time! Told him we're in the middle of research. You're not falling in love with him, right? That's hurt! What's wrong? It has the same aura as Yuda. There's a Javanese script. Can you read it? What about you? "Sura Dira Jayaningrat… Lebur Dening Pangastuti." What does it mean? All the courage, strength, glory, and luxury that exist in humankind, which can lead to arrogance, cunning, and demolition… can be defeated by the love and wisdom that also exist in humankind. My mom used to tell me that. That must've been some kind of spell. Try to say it out loud. It could be a spell. Here. Sit here. Here, come here. Agni. Sura Dira Jayaningrat… Lebur Dening Pangastuti. Try to take a deep breath thrice… So it could be sacred. Try it. Sura Dira Jayaningrat… Lebur Dening Pangastuti! -What are you doing? -I thought it could be dramatic. To spit it with water. Dummy. Who is he? He's the one who takes my brother and father. You never report it to the police? I already did. Along with other victims. But it gives us nothing. And now I realized he was just a tool. You're not the only one looking for revenge. Me too. I have to take this man. The man who takes my brother and father. Whatever it takes. Yuda! It glows! What? Yes, look! Wait! That is not how you do it. You need to give it a smash. Let me try it. Come on! Harder! Calm down! It hurts! Hit it harder! It's metal, Ge, not a pillow! Enough. I know where the right place is. Follow me. Let's go, guys. Come on! Come here. What should I say to your father and Nathan? You can't keep doing this! Quinn, this is more important than Nathan! You see it yourself how Yuda's mom becomes a victim. Please, take care of Nathan and my dad first. Bye! Tetuka Temple! Tetuka Temple or Gatotkaca Temple. I bring you here in order to help you feel your ancestor's energy. Try to give it a go. Wait! Yuda, you could smash it here. Come here. -Take a step up. -Why? Just try it here. It will look better here. Let's try it out. Take off your jacket. Yuda… Before you try to smash it, imagine one person that you hate the most. Alright? Let's try it out.

Even though she is my daughter. You're cruel. Is this Sudarshana Chakra? Yes. -This is Krishna's heirlooms, right? -That's right. -Is it yours? -Everything in this room is mine, darling. This book explains how Aswatama were freed from the Devatas' curse, after gathering 100 souls of Pandavas. Since the fall of Ndaru. And I haven't seen any signs the fall of Ndaru to date. Ndaru has already fallen, Professor. -That's not possible. -I saw it with my own eyes, Dad. I think it would be 10 or 20 more years. But this heirloom said otherwise. Brajamusti. The fallen Ndaru is used to look for this heirloom. And the victims are already more than a hundred. Can I see it? Sorry, I can't hand this heirloom to just anyone. You're right. I understand, Yuda. That's a remarkable heirloom. I found your heirloom. Mother. I already told you I didn't believe in that kind of things. Danan. Look! I found a hidden district. I think that's the hiding place of the Figure. This is the heirloom of Narayanastra. With this heirloom, you will be protected. My daughter! Agni! Mother! Gege, hide! She's not breathing, Professor. We need to take her to the hospital. -Agni. -I can't feel her pulse, Professor. Mother. Don't do that, mother! Mother! Mother! Agni. Agni. Our place has been attacked!

Whatever your boss has promised you, it will never happen. What do you know? How can you know your boss is Kaurava? My boss is Lord Aswatama's right hand It's impossible he's Pandava. Then tell me your boss' name? You'll never know! Gege. Bring me the holy water. Hurry! He has Duhsala's gene. Kaurava's commander. Boss. This is the traitor. Back off, Gege! You! Come here! Yuda! -What? -He's not what we're looking for. Don't hit him. He's Yoddha Pandava. The protector of Pandava. That's the logo. -He asked where did you get your heirloom? -I know. I live with him since I was a kid. It's not your business where did I get this heirloom from! Ge. Ge? Yuda! My necklaces… My necklaces, Yuda! My necklaces… Danan. Let's go to the hospital. Come on. You don't need to think about us. You are chosen by the Devatas to protect Pandavas. Arya Laksana. He's the only one who can help us. Just go to Arya Laksana. Quinn? Quinn? Quinn? Damn. What are you doing here? We're done. Why did you come to my best friend's house? Your best friend? Push it. Relax, ma'am. Try to relax. Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath. It's almost there. Take a deep breath. Arya and I both are Yoddha Pandava. We're really close. Without Arya, you'll not survive the birth. I'd like to help by best friend. It's okay. Your umbilical cord can only be cut by Konta Wijayadanu. Listen to me, Yuda! Do not speak like you're my father. You are not my father. I'm sorry. Please, give me a chance to explain. You're the one who should listen to me! Fifteen years I lived with my mom. We move from one place to another. My mom did anything she can so I could go to school. While trying to remember her fading memories She had an unbearable headache that made her screams like a mad woman. You didn't know it, did you? If I didn't meet the Erlanggas, I don't know how I will survive. And now you're here just to say you're sorry? Don't you dare. I didn't leave you. I was protecting you and your mother. Pande! Don't go. I have to leave both of you. Because I have to fight those Kauravas. So they couldn't take you, and the Brajamusti heirloom. Unfortunately, they went after you first. Give me the heirloom now! I thought the Kauravas has succeeded in taking the Brajamusti heirloom and killed both of you. Since then I chose to keep being Yoddha Pandava. Even though it's forbidden. But I alone couldn't protect all of them. More and more Pandavas have fallen. Until… I met you. This is Brajadenta heirloom. The pair of Brajamusti. With these heirloom, I hope together we can find where Kaurava is hiding. Only with these heirloom, we can go through another dimension and go to Patala gate. The Ancient City of Astinapura. This is the moment I was waiting for. Fighting the Kauravas. Protecting the Pandavas. Welcome to the Patala Dimension. I acknowledge that your heirloom is remarkable that could help you entering this place. But let us see. Can you both get out from this place in one piece. Dad? Do not be surprised. This is a miracle. A miracle? We're the faithful servants of Lord Aswatama, dear. But we're not Kaurava. As well as Aswatama. He's not Kaurava, nor Pandavas. But why they choose to defend Kauravas, my child? Because the Kauravas are the one who deserve to rule The Kingdom of Astinapura that was being taken by the Pandavas. Back then, your mother and I along with those Pandavas fought together. But now, they have become the state officials. They have forgotten their initial intention. Your mother and I criticized them. But your mother have become their victim. Stop! Get off! -Kill them! -Shoot them. Let's go. I became paralyzed for life. Darling? Darling? I feel frustrated. Ndaru descended when I almost killed myself. So you were the one who murdered those Pandavas. Erlangga? -Yuda's mother? -The sacrifice is necessary, dear. Good morning, Arimbi. Arya! My purse has been stolen. -A thief! -Don't run! I will fight him. You go look for Agni. Agni! Yuda. Professor Arya. Gatotkaca. I can still remember clearly how this hands saved you. Stop all of this, Professor! No! Dad! -Yuda! -Professor. Dad, no! Dad! Dad! Pandega… Why are you keep doing this? We're together again. You must be fed up too with all the corruption and hypocrisy in this life. Please stop this madness, Professor! Like father like son. Finish them, Beceng. Dad! This is the time of Pandavas to pay the price of the Devatas who choose the Pandavas as the winner in Bharatayuddha war. Only Kauravas' descendants who deserve to rule in Astinapura. Professor. Professor. Professor. Hang in there, Professor! Professor. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, dear. I was blinded by the Kauravas. This is my karma, Pandega. I'd like to ask for a favor. May I die in your son's hand? Help me, Pandega. Professor. What are you talking about? Hang on, Professor. Please. It will be an honor to die in the hands of Gatotkaca. Please, Yuda. Help me, Pandega. Yuda, please! Don't do that! Yuda, don't! No! Yuda! Dad! Dad! Hey, is the family drama done? Come here! Dad! Dad. Hey! I'm not dead yet. Hey, do not run away! Come here! Coward! Fight me! Come here! Fight me! Die! Die! You need to die! I'll kill you! Yuda! Beceng is protected by the power of Aswatama. Watch out, mother! Agni. Give Yuda the Narayanastra. Yuda! I acknowledge your cunning for using my own weapon to defeat me, but it's not over yet. You're finished, Kaurava! There's a hundred even a thousand Kauravas that you haven't meet. Yuda, no! Enough, Yuda. You're a weakling! Kill me! Kill me! You wuss! I still remember your father and brother's face when they asked for mercy… when I throw them out into the sea with other Pandavas. Agni. Dad? This morning, the City of Astinapura were shaken by the news of mysterious death of the Barata University's rector, Professor Arya Laksana Wibisana. To date, the police hasn't yet found the person behind this mysterious death. The Holy water, Mother. Excuse me, are you the victim's relative? Yes. The holy water, sir. Please drink it. Thank you. Have a sip, the holy water. -Please drink it. -Thank you. Agni. My deepest condolences for you. Thank you. Yuda. After this, could you come to the station to give me your statement? How does it feel to be back to the campus, Yuda? It feels like I'm going back to my old home I left long ago. Thank you. For what? Honestly when I see my father's fate in your hands I would like to fight you. But after that, I saw the shine on my father's face. And I realized, every humans has their own dharma. They have responsibility to protect the universe, and my father destroyed it all. The gods could've cursed him as a despicable human, but with your hand… you have ended his karma honorably. I promise… I'll protect you… until the end. Gege. Yes, what's wrong, Ge? Yuda! The Governor office has been attacked by Kauravas. Please help them. I already sent you the location. -ASAP, Gatotkaca! -Ge, I… I have classes today. -Are you serious? -The classes can wait. -This is more important. -Alright. Have a good fight, Gatotkaca. Thank you. The citizen of Astinapura were shocked with the appearance of the masked figure who fended off the terrorists in the Governor Office… Hi, Agni. to date, the police can't identify… Nathan. Who are you? Agni. I'm sorry for disturbing your free time, but I only want to introduce a family friend to you. He is the replacement of your father… to take care of you. I'm the son of Sage Drona, oh, the descendant of Kunti, my sister in arm. Aswatama. Subtitle translation by: Nadhifa Firya
