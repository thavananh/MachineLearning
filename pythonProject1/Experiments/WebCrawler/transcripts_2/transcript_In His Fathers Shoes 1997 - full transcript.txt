[boys chattering] NO, NOT ANOTHER DETENTION. MY OLD MAN'S GONNA KILL ME. [Richard] DAMN GENERATOR. ALWAYS SQUEALING. [grunts] HEY, BOY. HEY, DAD, HOW WAS WORK? [grunts] THE ELECTRICAL BUSINESS DON'T PICK UP, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT FACTORY AND OPERATE THAT DAMN DRILL PRESS. [grunts] HOW COME YOU'RE NOT IN SCHOOL? 'CAUSE IT'S 4:00. 4:00? YEAH. A MAN SHOULD STILL BE WORKING AT 4:00. I GUESS. WHAT? YOU GUESS? WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT WORKING? HUH? I PUT HOT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR BOTH YOU AND YOUR SISTER. WHO THE HELL YOU THINK PAYS FOR THAT? HAND ME THAT WRENCH OUT THAT TOOLBOX. [wrench clanging] WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU BOY? CAN'T YOU HOLD ON TO ANYTHING? HUH? YOU SISTER SAYS SHE WANT A BRAND-NEW CAR. WHO DOES SHE THINK I AM, ROCKEFELLER OR SOMEBODY? AH, THIS WRENCH IS TOO BIG. GO IN THE GARAGE AND GET ME A SMALLER ONE. AND MAKE IT QUICK, BOY. POSTCARD, YOU'VE GOT TO BE HERE. LET'S SEE. GRANDMA. WHERE'S THAT WRENCH, BOY? JACKPOT! I GOT 'EM. IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU, BOY, YOU'LL HURRY UP. UH-OH. WHERE ARE YOU, POSTCARD? MAKE IT QUICK, BOY! IF YOU WANT THING DONE AROUND HERE, YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT YOURSELF. COME ON, GET IN THERE. WHAT IS TAKING YOU SO LONG, BOY? MMM! YOUR GRANDMOTHER CALLED TODAY. SHE MISSES YOU. SAYS SHE FORGETS WHAT THE TWO OF YOU LOOK LIKE. ANYWAY, SHE'S INVITED US UP FOR THE WEEKEND. THERE'S A WINTER CARNIVAL WITH GAMES AND ANIMALS. WANNA GO? I WANT TO GO. [knock on door] COME IN. MIND IF I PUT THIS STUFF AWAY? SURE, MOM. IF SOMETHING WERE BOTHERING YOU, YOU'D TELL ME, RIGHT? RIGHT. SO YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST THAT... I CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON ANYTHING. ALL I THINK ABOUT IS DAD. YEAH, I KNOW. ME TOO. REALLY? YOU KNOW, WE GET IMPATIENT WITH MAGGIE BECAUSE SHE PRETENDS DADDY'S AT THE TABLE OR SINGING HER TO SLEEP. BUT IN OUR OWN WAY, WE DO THE SAME THING-- PRETEND, PLAY GAMES. WE JUST DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. I THINK WE SHOULD. I GUESS. MOM, WHY WAS GRANDPA SO MEAN TO DAD AND AUNT CELESTE WHEN THEY WERE KIDS? WELL, I DON'T THINK HE INTENDED TO BE MEAN. I THINK HE WAS JUST DISAPPOINTED. IN WHAT? HIMSELF, THE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS. SEE, HE'D DONE ALL THESE HEROIC THINGS IN THE WAR AND KEPT DEMOCRACY ALIVE. AND THEN HE GOT BACK HOME AND NOBODY CARED. SO HE MARRIED YOUNG, HAD A FAMILY AND JUST SETTLED. AS YOUR DAD AND AUNT CELESTE GREW OLDER, HE SEEMED TO BE RESENTFUL, ALMOST JEALOUS OF THEM. WHY? THEY WERE YOUNG; THEY HAD THEIR LIVES AHEAD OF THEM. HE'D GIVEN UP HIS DREAM OF BECOMING A DOCTOR IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEM. DID DAD GIVE UP HIS DREAM FOR US? OH. ABSOLUTELY NOT. YOU AND MAGGIE WERE HIS DREAM. YOU KNOW, SOME MEN WERE BORN TO BE FATHERS. YOUR DAD WAS ONE OF THEM. SLEEP WELL. GOOD NIGHT, MOM. GOOD NIGHT, HONEY. I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK YOU HAD FORGOTTEN THE WAY. WE STOPPED FOR BREAKFAST. HI, GRANDMA. MY SWEETNESS. LET'S SEE YOU. DON'T STAND THERE WITH YOUR TEETH IN YOUR MOUTH LIKE THAT. COME A LITTLE CLOSER SO I CAN GET A BETTER LOOK AT YOU. SOMETIME TODAY, BOY. HI, GRANDPA. COME ON, HELP ME WITH THESE BAGS, BOY. [Clay thinking] SAME OLD JUNK. SOME THINGS JUST NEVER CHANGE. OKAY, GUYS, LET'S GET IT RIGHT. THE POSTCARD'S IN THE GARAGE NEXT TO THE ROLLER SKATES. MMM! [D.J.] Here's a little tune you can groove to. [bebop playing] Ladies and gentlemen, we have seen some sizzling skaters so far here this evening at Scooter's Rollerway. You can leave your cares behind and let your dreams come true. Now I know the judges had a hard time making up their minds, but they have done it. In a couple of minutes, we'll have the performances of our two finalists. In the meantime, here's one more tune you can bop to. I SAID THE GARAGE. WAY TO GO, MAN. YOU MADE IT TO THE FINALS. THESE SHOES HAVE A MIND OF THEIR OWN. WHAT'D YOU SAY, FRANK? I MEAN THESE SKATES HAVE A MIND OF THEIR OWN. IF THEY'RE NOT LACED TIGHT, I COULD TWIST MY ANKLE. I THINK YOU LACED THEM A LITTLE TOO TIGHT. THEY CUT OFF CIRCULATION TO YOUR BRAIN. HURRY UP. WE ONLY HAVE A FEW MORE MINUTES TO WARM UP. THESE SKATES ARE PRETTY CRAPPY. NOW BLADES-- THAT'S THE WAY TO GO. YOU GUYS SHOULD INVEST IN THEM. BETTER YET, INVENT THEM. YOU'RE ACTING LIKE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ON SKATES BEFORE. HOW YOU GONNA WIN THE COMPETITION WITH DORKY STEPS LIKE THAT? WHAT COMPETITION? DUH, THE COMPETITION THAT YOU AND YOUR SISTER MIGHT BE ABLE TO WIN IF YOU STOP ACTING LIKE SUCH A SPAZ. COME ON, LET'S GO. COME ON! THESE THINGS ARE DANGEROUS. I NEED A REST. HEY, DORK! AH! I'M GONNA WHIP YOUR BUTT OUT THERE, CROSBY-- YOU AND YOUR STUCK-UP SISTER. LET ME GO! [laughs] AH! [both scream] [laughing] WHAT JUST HAPPENED? DAD, YOU GOT TO HELP ME. MMM! HO HO! BITE ME, BECK. [laughing] SEE YOU, DORK. "BITE ME"? WHAT ARE YOU, A MANIAC? COME ON. WE'D BETTER TAKE A REST BEFORE THE FINALS BEGIN. WHAT FINALS? FRANK! ALL RIGHT, ALL YOU COOL CATS AND KITTENS OUT THERE, I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO STEP BACK INTO THE SHADOWS. CLEAR THE FLOOR. IT IS THE TIME WE HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR-- THE CHAMPIONSHIP ROUND. NOW OUR FIRST CONTESTANTS ARE LAST YEAR'S CHAMPS, LISA CALMENARI AND DENNIS BECK.

I MUST SAY I AGREE WITH YOU. THIS CONTEST WAS NO CONTEST. THE $100 PRIZE GOES TO... CELESTE AND FRANK CROSBY! [Girl] YOU GUYS WERE GREAT. OH, THANKS. SEE? YOU EVER HAVE THE FEELING YOU REALLY DON'T BELONG HERE? OH WELL, YEAH. RECENTLY I STARTED FEELING THAT WAY A LOT. ME TOO. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. DAD IS DEAD SET AGAINST MY ACTING CAREER. HE WON'T EVEN LET MOM COME TO MY SCHOOL PLAY. MAYBE HE'S RIGHT. NO WAY. YOU'RE GONNA BE A GREAT ACTRESS SOMEDAY. RICH TOO. [laughs] NOT IF I DON'T FOLLOW MY DREAM. HEY, CELESTE? THEN FOLLOW IT. HERE, TAKE MY HALF. AND WHEN YOU'RE SUPER FAMOUS WITH TONS OF MONEY, DON'T FORGET YOUR LITTLE BROTHER AND HIS KIDS. I SHOULD GO CHANGE. MMM! OH, MAN, THESE ARE SO COOL. [engine starts] HE'S OUT.

IT'S INSTANT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THESE DAYS. GRANDMA, CAN YOU MAKE ME A MALTED... [laughs] WITH AN EGG IN IT? OH MY GOODNESS, I PUT THAT OLD MACHINE AWAY YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW, YOUR FATHER LOVED MALTEDS TOO. YEAH, I KNOW. I KIND OF LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD. GRANDMA, WHY WAS GRANDPA SO STRICT WITH DAD AND AUNT CELESTE? HE THOUGHT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING, YOU KNOW, BY NOT SHOWING TOO MUCH EMOTION-- PREPARING HIS CHILDREN FOR A LIFE OF LIMITED HOPES AND OPPORTUNITIES. BUT YOUR FATHER AND AUNT CELESTE-- THEY HAD HOPE. DID YOU HAVE HOPE, GRANDMA? AT FIRST WE BOTH DID. IN TRUTH, WE NEVER LIVED THE LIFE YOUR GRANDFATHER DREAMED OF. BUT HE ALWAYS TRIED TO PROVIDE THE THINGS WE NEEDED. I MEAN, EVEN IF WE DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE SOME OF THE THINGS WE WANTED, WE WERE NEVER POOR. WE WERE NEVER RICH, BUT WE WERE NEVER POOR. AND I ALWAYS LOVED-- GOODNESS. I HOPE MY TONGUE HASN'T WORN OUT ITS WELCOME WITH ALL THIS WAGGING. THIS IS SO NICE, JUST LIKE WHEN YOUR FATHER USED TO SIT RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE. WE'D HAVE LONG TALKS. ABOUT WHAT? [laughs] I REMEMBER ONCE HE WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE AND HE-- OH, YEAH, THAT WAS JUST BEFORE CELESTE RAN OFF. HE ASKED ME HOW HE'D KNOW HE WAS DOING WELL AS A GROWN-UP. AND I TOLD HIM HE COULD TELL BY THE LOOK IN HIS FAMILY'S EYE. AND WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES, I CAN TELL HE DID VERY WELL INDEED. HE DID-- MOST EXCELLENT. [laughing] MOST EXCELLENT. [Barker] THREE FOR $1! [Virginia] HEY, THIS LOOKS GREAT. [Clay] THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT. LOOK AT THAT CLOWN. LOOK AT HIS HAIR. WOULD YOU WALK IN LIKE THAT-- THAT RED HAIR? NO. [Richard] OH, WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING, BOY. WALK STRAIGHT. WE'RE SORRY. HEY, MAGGIE, WAIT FOR-- MAGGIE? MOM! MOM! I WANT TO PLAY THE GAMES. OH, MY, YOU AS FRISKY AS A LITTER PUP. HERE YOU GO, MY DEAR. HERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. WHY DON'T YOU GO WITH HER? AND STAY TOGETHER! HEY, MAGGIE, WAIT FOR ME. HEY, LITTLE GIRL, WOULD YOU LIKE A BALLOON? FAT CAT BALL TOSS! ONLY A TICKET. FAT CAT BALL TOSS. HERE'S MY TICKET. HELLO, LITTLE LADY. HERE YOU GO. LET'S SEE YOUR STUFF. GOT HIM! WELL DONE. YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE, EH? THERE YOU GO. YEAH! GREAT SHOT, MAGGIE! HERE, YOU GOT YOUR LAST ONE. YES! OH, YEAH, RIGHT! YEAH! HERE, MY DEAR. OH, MY GOSH, A FISH. YOUR VERY OWN GOLDFISH. THERE YOU GO, SWEETHEART. HEY, MAGGIE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? HEY, MAGGIE, WAIT UP. I THINK YOU FORGOT SOMEONE. I DON'T WANT HIM. YOU SURE? HE NEARLY JUMPED OUT OF THE BAG AFTER YOU. I THINK HE LIKES YOU. HE'S GONNA DIE JUST LIKE DADDY. IT'S NOT FAIR. COME ON. LOOK, BEFORE YOU WERE BORN, MOMMY'S PARENTS DIED. I CRIED A LOT. THEY WERE NICE. ANYWAY, DADDY TOLD ME NOT TO BE SAD, THAT I WAS MADE OF A PIECE OF THEM AND THAT THEY'D ALWAYS BE PART OF ME. AS LONG AS I LIVED, THEY LIVED. IT'S LIKE THIS LITTLE GUY. HE'S MADE UP OF A WHOLE CHAIN OF FISH JUST LIKE ME AND YOU ARE MADE UP OF A WHOLE CHAIN OF FAMILY WHERE EVERYONE LIVES FOREVER IN EACH OTHER. SO HERE, TAKE HIM. TAKE HIM. COME ON, TAKE HIM. TAKE HIM! GO SHOW MOM. MOM! MOM! LOOK WHAT I GOT. [Woman] CLASS! CLASS, SETTLE DOWN, PLEASE. [Telegram] I HATE THOSE STUPID PECKERWOODS. [Bruce] BE SURE WHEN YOU RALPH, YOU DON'T JUST RALPH ON THE GROUND; RALPH ON BECK. [Mary Lou] WHAT A DOOFUS. [Man] OKAY, WHO'S GOING TO BE THE LUCKY PANCAKE PERSON? YEAH, I JUST NEED ONE MORE PERSON. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, THERE'S A HUNGRY-LOOKING BOY JUST RIGHT FOR THE POWER PANCAKE-EATING CONTEST. THE WHAT? THE FIRST PERSON WHO FINISHES ALL THE PANCAKES WINS $100. I DON'T THINK SO. OH, COME ON, COME ON. GIVE IT A TRY. YOU CAN DO IT. NO ONE'S EVER BEAT OUR CHAMPION DENNIS BECK. HEY, GIVE HIM A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT THERE MAYBE, HUH? HA HA HA! HEY, THAT'S THE SPIRIT. COME ON UP HERE. WAY TO GO, WAY TO GO. SIT RIGHT DOWN THERE AND PUT THAT #8 CONTESTANT BIB RIGHT ON HIM. OKAY, WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE READY TO ROLL. OH, MY GOD, IT'S CLAY.

YOU'RE SLOWING DOWN. GO ON, BOY. SHOW ME WHAT MY SON IS MADE OF. EAT! WE HAVE A WINNER! LET'S HEAR IT FOR HIM, EVERYBODY! NYUK NYUK NYUK! [Female barker] GUESS YOUR WEIGHT! COME ON OVER HERE AND GUESS YOUR WEIGHT. COME ON NOW, GIVE IT A TRY. THERE YOU GO, BOY. THANKS. MM-HMM. YOU CALLED ME YOUR SON. YEAH, WELL, I'M REAL PROUD OF YOU, BOY. YOU BEAT THAT BLOWHARD BECK. [laughs] YOUR FATHER-- HE NEVER DID LIKE THAT-- THAT S.O.B. DID YOU EVER TELL MY DAD THAT YOU WERE PROUD OF HIM? HUH? OH, NO NO NO, DIDN'T HAVE TO. HE ALWAYS KNEW. HOW? WAS HE SUPPOSED TO GUESS? WHAT IS THIS, THE SPANISH INQUISITION OR SOMETHING? YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM, GRANDPA. WHAT? LOOK, BOY, I WORKED HARD TO TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY. YOUR FATHER AND THAT-- THAT AUNT CELESTE-- ALL THEY WANTED TO DO WAS HAVE FUN, YOU KNOW? LIVE OUT THEIR DREAMS. WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT THAT? I WANTED TO MAKE SURE HE TOOK CARE OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES. I WAS SCARED HE WOULDN'T BE PREPARED FOR THIS WORLD, A WORLD THAT DIDN'T WANT HIM; A WORLD THAT DIDN'T WANT ME. I MUST ADMIT, THOUGH, HE DID GET SOME GOOD GRADES. HE KEPT MOUTHING OFF IN CLASS. HE HAD THEM MISFIT FRIENDS. HE COULDN'T DO NOTHING WITH HIS HANDS. HE'D TRY MY PATIENCE SOMETIMES, ESPECIALLY WHEN I'D GET HOME, YOU KNOW? I WAS TIRED FROM WORK. AND THEN I'D-- HIT HIM? NO NO NO NO NO, I NEVER LAID A HAND ON HIM-- NEVER. I WILL TELL YOU ONE THING, THOUGH. HE WASN'T SCARED. HE NEVER WOULD BACK DOWN. ONE DAY HE WALKED PAST MY RAISED HAND INTO ADULTHOOD... NOW HE'S GONE FOREVER. I GUESS I-- I GUESS I WASN'T MUCH OF A SUCCESSFUL FATHER. WELL, MAYBE YOU WERE AFTER ALL, GRANDPA. BECAUSE WHEN DAD GOT SICK, HE REFUSED TO BE SCARED. HE DIDN'T BACK DOWN. AH, HE WAS JUST TOO YOUNG TO DIE. YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD OF HIM, GRANDPA-- VERY PROUD. THIS WAS A PICTURE OF HIM AT HIS GRADUATION. HE GRADUATED WITH HONORS. I WAS SO PROUD OF HIM I COULD BURST. HERE. YOU TAKE IT. BUT YOU NEVER TOLD HIM. NO. I'M TELLING YOU. I LOVED THAT BOY SO MUCH. DAD GAVE ME A MESSAGE FOR YOU, GRANDPA. HE MADE ME PROMISE TO TELL YOU-- TO TELL YOU THAT HE LOVED YOU. LISTEN UP, GUYS, WE'RE REAL CLOSE. POSTCARD'S IN THE GARAGE. TAKE ME TO THE POSTCARD. MMM. WHAT THE-- I GUESS WE'RE BACK. DAD, I FOUND IT! YES! [Richard's voice] 25th OCTOBER, 1944. LATE-DAY GOLF. DEAREST GINNY, AFTER THE WAR, MARRY ME. OUR LIFE WILL BE MADE IN HEAVEN. LOVE, RICHIE. YES. COME ON, MICK, LET'S GO HOME. MMM! DAD, I JUST CAN'T FIND IT-- YES! [knock on door] YEAH? HI, HONEY. CAN I COME IN? SURE. BOY, DAD LEFT A LOT OF MEMORIES IN THIS ROOM. [laughs] HE WON THIS ON OUR FIRST DATE. HOW DID YOU AND DAD MEET? OH, MY, I HAVEN'T TOLD THAT STORY IN A LONG TIME. UM, WE WERE IN THE SAME PSYCHOLOGY CLASS. AND I WOULD SAY FOR THAT WHOLE FIRST SEMESTER, I NEVER EVEN NOTICED HIM. THEN ONE DAY, ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE OUR FINAL, I GOT THIS POSTCARD IN THE MAIL. YOUR FATHER HAD A THING FOR POSTCARDS. AND IT SAID, "I'D LIKE TO GO OUT WITH YOU." AND IT WAS SIGNED, "ROW 4, SEAT 17." SO THE NEXT DAY, I TOOK SPECIAL NOTICE OF WHAT WAS SITTING THERE. AND AT THE END OF CLASS, I GAVE HIM A PIECE OF PAPER WITH MY PHONE NUMBER ON IT. YOU KNOW AT THAT MOMENT, MY LIFE CHANGED FOREVER. MY LIFE CHANGED AGAIN THE DAY THE DOCTOR TOLD US HE WAS SICK. DECEMBER THE 20th, THAT WAS THE DATE. AND EVERYBODY WAS FEELING GOOD ABOUT CHRISTMAS AND ABOUT THEIR LIVES. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL. NO, I DO. I DO. YOUR FATHER FOUGHT THE CANCER THE WAY HE FOUGHT EVERYTHING, LIKE HE COULDN'T THINK OF NOT WINNING. BUT THE RADIATION WASN'T WORKING AND THE CHEMO JUST TURNED HIS BODY INTO A BATTLEFIELD. THE PAIN WAS ALWAYS THERE. SO WE FOUND A DOCTOR WHO PUT HIM ON A SPECIAL PROGRAM OF VITAMINS, HERBS, ACUPUNCTURE, VISUALIZATION. AND IT WORKED FOR HIM... FOR US. SO CLAY, PLEASE DON'T BLAME ME. I DON'T. TWO DAYS BEFORE HE DIED, I GOT ANOTHER POSTCARD IN THE MAIL. IT SAID, "I'LL WAIT FOR YOU. TAKE YOUR TIME. TAKE A LIFETIME." AND IT WAS SIGNED, "ETERNALLY, ROW 4, SEAT 17." YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY-- I HAVE NO REGRETS WHATSOEVER, EXCEPT FOR ONE-- I REALLY WISH YOU'D HAD MORE TIME WITH HIM. I HAD FUN AT THE CARNIVAL. YOU DID? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU LIKED PANCAKES SO MUCH. HA! YEAH. YOU THE CHAMP. YOU KNEW THAT, HUH? YEAH. HERE WE GO. WHAT A GREAT GOING-AWAY PRESENT. NAH, THAT'S A COMING-HOME PRESENT, BOY. YOUR FATHER AND YOUR AUNT CELESTE, THEY NEVER CAME BACK. DON'T YOU BE A STRANGER TOO, BOY. ALL RIGHT. I HAVE A PRESENT FOR YOU TOO. OH, YEAH? [screen door opens] [Virginia] I NEED YOU TO EAT YOUR ASPARAGUS, OKAY? NOT JUST THE TIPS. AND YOUR COLLARD GREENS. YOUR MAMA EVER MAKE COLLARD GREENS FOR YOU BEFORE? NEVER? WELL, LISTEN, YOU BE GOOD CHILDREN AND DON'T GIVE YOUR MOTHER ANY TROUBLE, OKAY? OKAY? I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, GRANDMA. OH, SWEETIE. I LOVE YOU BOTH. YOU ARE THE DEAREST THINGS IN THE WORLD TO ME. OH! ALL RIGHT. BETTER GET MOVING NOW, Y'ALL. OKAY? OKAY. BYE, SWEETIE. BYE. GO ON. HERE YOU GO, BABY. HERE.

YOU TAKE CARE DRIVING NOW, HEAR? [horn toots] [ringing] HELLO, CELESTE? Daddy? YEAH. [laughing] ♪ Well, I will stand beside you ♪ ♪ Hold you up... ♪ [Janice] OOH, NOW THAT'S ROCK 'N' ROLL, NOT THAT STONE TEMPLE, SNAPPIN' DUMMIES, CRASHING PUMPKINS STUFF YOU LISTEN TO. I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL. YOU CAN LISTEN TO ANYTHING YOU WANT. ANYTHING? YEAH, ANYTHING... IF WE CAN MAKE A STOP ON THE WAY HOME, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. HEY, YOU GOT A DEAL. HELLO? ANYONE HOME? I'M CLOSED. I GUESS YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME. OF COURSE I DO. YOU'RE THE BOY WITH THE FATHER. NOW GO AWAY AND CLOSE THE BEADS BEHIND YOU. I CAME TO RETURN THE SHOES THAT YOU GAVE HIM. DID YOUR FATHER WEAR THEM? NO, I WORE THEM. SO YOU JUST SLIPPED INTO ANOTHER MAN'S SHOES? DID THEY FIT? YEAH, THEY FIT REAL WELL. BUT I DON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE. I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE THEM TO SOME OTHER KID-- LOOK WHAT CAME IN YESTERDAY. [Clay] I LOVE YOU, DAD.
