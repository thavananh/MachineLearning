Yes, uh Rafi’s gonna do the day-to-day and-- and J-- Justin will be covering night shift. Right... I like you Charlie, you're a nice man. Thanks. There is a fine line between being a nice man and a doormat. MUSHIRA: It is good to be liked but a manager needs to be respected. -Manager? -Yes.

Thunderstruck all the way and uh... Brigitte Nielsen. -Who? -RAFI: Brigitte Nielsen. From Rocky 4 and Red Sonja. Oh, man, she’d kick ass and then afterwards we’d... Bow chicka, bow wow. Ugh, dude. She's gotta be at least 60. RAFI: I’m talkin' circa 1984 Brigitte Nielsen. You know, from Red frackin’ Sonja. Have you seen it? -Pieces. I wasn’t even born yet. -RAFI: My god! You're killing me Jaybird. I-- I don't want to-- I don't want to take your geek card but, you know what? I’m the “Judge Dread” of geekdom. I’m not just gonna let this go. Okay? Who'd you pick? [TEXT TONE] [CLICKING] Hate autocorrect. [PINGING] Alright, so I’d start with dual katanas. Great reach. Not gonna jam, run out of the Ammo-- here. Use these. -Thank you. -JAYHAWK: Music wise, I go with something jazzy. Benny Goodman, Glen Miller. -RAFI: Bullshit. Bullshit. -What? Glen Miller? What? Are we sitting down for tea? I-- I-- I’m sorry. I just don’t-- You know what? You don't understand It’s-- it's about the ja-- it’s about the swing. DELIVERY GUY: You ready, Boss? This puppy’s real heavy so when I push, you better be pulling. CHARLIE: Yeah, whenever you're ready. [GRUNTING] CHARLIE: Watch out for the servers, okay? DELIVERY GUY: Where do you want it? CHARLIE: Right in here. DELIVERY GUY: Another keypad.

I need something to tie my swing out to. You know what I’m saying? [HUMMING] RAFI: What... what is that? No one’s killed zombie's like that. You look like-- you look like my dad at my cousin's wedding. He's dead. Is that what you want? You look like a drunk octopus right now. DELIVERY GUY: I see ya in Tijuana, boss. [CLEARS THROAT] [PHONE DINGS] - [ZAPPING] -Ow! God! Ow. - [DISTORTION] -Hey, Rafi. Hey Rafi, Jay? JAYHAWK: Yeah, you’ve mentioned that... everyday -since we started working here. -RAFI: Well you better start listening Jaybird, because my botnet could send this whole place back to 1983, baby. How many zombies have you infected? RAFI: Fifty million, individual CPUs. - [MOUSE SQUEAKING] -CHARLIE: Rafi, Jay, you read? -Is that a lot? -Is that a lot? [CHUCKLES] Conficker maybe infected a third of that -at its peak. -CHARLIE: Hey, come in! How’d you do it? RAFI: Let’s just say, there's a lot of people out there willing to click a link promising pictures to Daniel Redcliff’s Hairy Peter. Hey, Charlie, sorry. Uh the walkie was turned out for some reasons. Seriously? Can one of you turn down the nano-desiccants in here? I’m getting some nasty static buildup. -JAYHAWK: Okay. -Use my login. Yeah, you got it. Sorry, man. M.A.N.A? M.A.N.A? RAFI: Ah, this reminds me of those old RVG floppies, remember? How [MOCKING] "You are standing in front of the floppy. You cannot run the floppy." We’re good. We're good. [SHUSHING] Charles! -Come check this out! -CHARLIE: Ah, yeah. Yeah, one sec. JAYHAWK: Jack this into old Frankenschtein -RAFI: Uh, huh. - [CLICKS] [DISJOINTED MELODY] -Oh yeah. -CHARLIE: Hey. Haven’t heard that sound in a long time. So, how’d you make this? Watched like a million YouTube videos, taught myself how to do it, I mean, I needed a little help - [CLEARS THROAT] -I mean, uh, coding. RAFI: What he means is I wrote it. JAYHAWK: Well, I gave you the framework. Which wasn’t elegant or functional but that’s fine, JAYHAWK: Your face isn’t elegant or functional. Relax, I’m just busting your balls. How many YouTube videos? Wait, this is the best part. [HUMS] Oh, yeah. It’s great. Really great, uh... but my wife baked me something special for my birthday, so, uh I’ll see you guys Monday. -Oh! It's your birthday? -Oh, happy birthday. -What number is it? -CHARLIE: Uh, 42. Forty-two. The meaning of life, the universe and everything... -Douglas Adams. -Raf! It’s a lot cooler when you don’t tell us what you’re referencing. Just-- come on man, just-- Relax, I’m just busting your balls! Awww! Touché. -Hey, thank you. -RAFI: Okay, so we're even. Alright guys, I will see you on Monday. -Good night, love you. -See you! Uh, I am gonna pop on down to the gym. -Get a workout in. -The gym? That intern wouldn’t happen to be there, would she? -RAFI: Roxie? I wouldn’t know. -JAYHAWK: Roxie? Okay, right. Uh, Jayhawk. Uh, we forgot to lock the server room. I’ll do it on my own. Happy birthday! Let’s just do it real quick... let’s go. Okay. Have fun at the gym, Cyrano. That’s the good looking one, right? - [KEYPAD BEEPS] - [KEYCODE BEEPS] - [ACCESS BEEPING] - [ELEVATOR DINGING] -Hi, Mushira! -Hello, Raphael. -Your hair looks amazing today. -Thank you. -How’s your son doing at UCI? -She's good. -Uh. he’s a sophomore this year? -She is. -She? -MUSHIRA: Good night, Raphael. - [CAR BEEPING] - [CRICKETS CHIRPING] I think I nailed that. I think I nailed It. [MAKES EXPLOSION NOISE] Have a good weekend, Sir. Backatcha, homeslice. [BEAT BOXING] Too much... [TIRES SCREECHES] Damn. [CHUCKLES] Bitch has places to be, -I guess. - [BEEPS] -LEX: You get it? -SPARROW: Yeah, but it’s-- it's still Decrypting. Good, alright. Good job script-kiddie. Want me to zap another RFID? Just in case? No. Decryption’s solid. I wrote it myself. [SIGHS] [BEEPS] See. You ready to go? Burton? -Oh, yeah. -Well yippee-yi-fuckin-yay kids. Let’s go. JAYHAWK: Congratulations, Charlie. CHARLIE: Title change. I’ll pretty much be doing the same thing. Still great. Really proud of you. Thanks. Actually, that-- that wasn't all we talked about. JAYHAWK: Oh, yeah. What? Uh, this here. Oh, badass! Whoa! whoa! whoa, whoa! Careful. Company prototype. I’ve been reading about these things. -You have? -Yeah. Haven't you? Liquid submerged cooling, you can over-clock the processors like crazy. M.A.N.A? Yeah, that uh M.A.N.A or M.A.N.A or something? -What does that stand for? -Automatic Network Assistant um, supposed to help us control the server room, maintain it. Power consumption. Environmental controls. -Hmm. -Kind of like a big thermostat. Oh, it’s so much more than just a thermostat! -Have you put this thing on yet? -No. No, I thought, maybe Monday. Oh, come on! Aren’t you curious? [TWEETS] [BEEPS] SECURITY GUARD: Did you forget something? Drop him. CHARLIE: I know it’s not a lot to see. Maybe some lights blink. JAYHAWK: Yeah, I guess, you’re right. Okay. Okay, we boot it up, we say “Wow. Gee whiz” and then we shut it down, alright? -Yeah, yeah, yeah! -Yeah and we don’t mess with it till Monday! -Yeah. -We. Don't mess -with it till Monday. -Yeah. -Of course. -Alright. Uh, I don’t see... What? What’d you do? Did you do something? JAYHAWK: No, I didn’t do anything. [ZOOMING] -It’s green. - [LAUGHS] - [BEEPING] -LEX: Shit! SPARROW: Requires two factor authentication. -We need a key code. -Yeah. I can see that. Turn this office inside-out. Maybe Pineapple Express has uh, -something on his desk. -That could take a while. Then let’s expedite this bitch, yeah? Yeah. -Where’d you find her? -She’s a telecom engineer, Lex -and a damn good one. -LEX: She looks like she hasn’t even ridden the crimson wave yet. Spoofing the RFID. That was her idea, remember? LEX: Yeah. I guess so. It’s not gonna do us any good though if we can’t get past the key pad. Epic. Here. What? Are you gonna dust... the key? Every employee has a different PIN. What are you doing? Just a trick I used back in the day... on ATM’s. - [BEEPS] - [SQUEALING] You are so getting laid tonight. -Really? By who? - [LAUGHS] You’re a dick! Sparrow, stop grepping around. Come on. -Coming. - [BEEPS] Oh, that's weird. Shh, get down, get down. JAYHAWK: Who are these people? We gotta get out. -Shh. -We gotta get-- gun? I see it. Uh, stay here. Why? Why would I want to stay-- I wanna go talk to them. I’m gonna talk to them. While they’re distracted, you go get security You can’t go out there! You could get hurt! [SIGHS] I’m just gonna keep them talking. You’re not John McClane. Yeah. I know that! I’m just doing my job. -Shh! -I don’t think taking a bullet is in the job description. SPARROW: Where do we even start? We’re looking for full, dedicated servers because that’s where the good shit’s at. I think it’s pronounced “Tooly“. Cool it, Wikipedia. Uh, spread out. Go down the aisles and let me know if you guys find anything that looks like it doesn’t want to be opened. LEX: You don’t see this place in the commercials, do you? [LAUGHS] Thule. Where your dreams go to die. - [SQUEAKS] - [GASPS] -LEX: Sparrow? You okay? -Yeah. Yes... it's just a rat. A rat? Can you just search for the THULE servers, please? You ever heard of rat poison? Hey babe, can you hand me one of those uh, chuggy things? [SODA CAN OPENING] Stop! Excuse me, don’t shoot, don't shoot. I'm sorry. No food or drink allowed in the server room. Company policy. I’m sorry, Miss. -We have a code nine! -Whoa, whoa, whoa! Alright now. Then get on your knees, geek squad. -Okay. -Down. On my knees. Where the hell is Sparrow? -Sparrow! -I'll be right there! Come on, little guy. Ugh... damn it, Charlie. What did you... Who's that? What was that? What's going on? I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah... alright. Alright, M.A.N.A... let's see, what's under this hood. Wow... [LAUGHS] You’re fast... alright... LEX: Come on, my ass is now asleep. -Ah, Charlie... umm. - [BUZZING] What are you doing? Why do you keep-- Why do you keep changing everything? Why do you keep changing everything? So, Porky, you're the only one here? Yeah, I'm the night shift administrator. I-- I-- I’m the only one in the building You-- you guys should get out of here before the police come. I mean, they're on their way. If you leave now, we can pretend this whole thing never happened. Sparrow, will you pull up any local APBs? He lied. There's no cops coming. -How'd she get on the internet? -Wi-Fi. Yeah but you don’t have a password. Derp, derpity, derp. [SIGHS] We have to keep moving, we have a schedule that was a good try though. Uh, by the way, we are looking for tool-y dedicated servers. Do you know, where those are? Stop. Why! Why do you... why do you need a login? Okay. Alright. [GRUNTING] [GROANS] You poor, pitiful noob. [COUGHS] Do you want to tell us, where the Tool-y -dedicated servers are now? - [PANTING] [SIGHS] I tell you what man, I don’t think they're paying you enough for this. I mean you obviously just got the shit kicked out of you and you’re staring down the barrel of a gun. All for... do you even know what's on these things? -It’s confidential. -Right. - [COUGHING] -Of course, it is but in theory it could be um... cat videos or babies dancing. Whatever it is, it is pretty important to you, right? You’re right... let's find out, how much. [SIGHS] Hold on to your pots. -Shit! Who hit the light switch? -SPARROW: It wasn't me. Stop standing around, Scary Spice, and figure out how to get the lights back on. Go! Where’d the god damn sysadmin go? Burton! LEX: Hey! Who’s got eyes on Porky? BURTON: Lex, I’m on it. LEX: You better find him, right fucking now or I’m gonna cut somebody! [SQUEAKS] Hello, lil’ guy. Sorry I spooked you. You shouldn’t be here... I shouldn’t be here either. - [RAT SQUEAL] - [SURGES] Oh, no... oh, no... oh no. Little guy... you okay? [GASPS] Oh shit! Shit! [PANTING] -LEX: You hurt? -No, no. -then what the hell? -The rat, it's-- it's dead, it's-- it's dead. LEX: So, I guess they have heard of rat poisoning. -Rat poison doesn't do that. -Okay. -That's-- that's-- that's not... -Hey, guess what? How many fingers, am I holding up? What? You’re not holding up any. That’s exactly how many fucks I give about this! Now, come on! [GROANING] [COUGHING] Charlie! Thank god! We gotta get the hell out of here! -Jay. -Come on, come on. Your phone. -Your phone! -No leave it, leave it. [MUFFLED INTERCOM VOICE] Shit. [GROANS] [GRUNTS] RAFI: 15. [GROANS] Hey. [CHUCKLES] Sorry. I was just noticing your incline level. -What? -I’m sorry. [BLOWS RASPBERRY] My brain. Your resistance level, yeah, it’s set to zero It just puts all this excess stress on the shins -and meniscus. -I had no idea. -Yeah... so whe- -Didn’t know that. - [LAUGHS] Thanks. Yeah. -No way. Yeah, yeah, no problem. Just watch that resistance level. [LAUGHS] Kewl... LEX: What do you mean, we’re trapped? BURTON: Hey, just take it down a few notches. okay, all she’s saying is that the locking mechanism is on the outside. We can’t get to it from in here. -What are you doing? -There’s no dial tone. Good. That way the FBI won’t be crawling up our asshole. Figure out how to get through that door, break the glass if you have to, make sure you keep an eye on those two. E.T., come with me. I think I finally figured out why we’re here. LEXI: Hello, beautiful. You okay? Yeah, yeah. I guess, I am fine. -You? -Yeah. -Man, he really worked you over. -Yeah, well I guess. Yeah, well I guess I got it a lot worse in high school so... whatever. You got picked on in high school? You’re seven feet tall. I’m 6’2. 6'2. It’s a very average, normal human height. Wow... there’s always someone bigger though, right? Oh and uh, thanks for trying to save us. Well, everything was going so perfectly. The lights went out, we made it to the door... Right... whoa, whoa, you turned out the lights? Yeah, I tweaked them on as machine code. Set a timer. Connected it to the building systems. Rafi would lose his will to code, -if he saw what I just did. -How did you connect M.A.N.A -to the building systems? -Used your login. You used my login? You, you-- I-- you shou-- [SIGHS] What? [SIGHS] That’s giving it, systems administrator access to everything, to the building, to the client servers- -Yeah. -To infrastructure! I don’t-- I-- I don't think -you should have done that. -What was I supposed to do? Never mind. Never mind. Probably couldn’t get any worse than this, right? [FOOTSTEPS CLICKING] LEX: Whoa. Hello gorgeous. Oh, baby. Tell me everything. [GASPS] And you have wheels too. Okay... unplug this. Take it out there. I’m gonna check on Burton and see if he’s been able to get through that door. Shit. [SIGHS] I’m just standing there, killing zombies... wh-- wh-- [SIGHS] why don’t I just-- if I don't get the heck out of there, they’re just gonna eventually over run me -and I’ll be eaten alive. -Your completely missing the point, it’s supposed to be cool. Well, not getting eaten alive seems pretty cool. -Would you just play along? -I am playing. -I am playing along. Yes. -What weapon would you use? My cell phone. Yes, I would call a friend. -Really? -And get the hell out of there. Chaz, I don’t mean to be condescending -but if you ever see-- -I hate when you call me Chaz. Charles, I don’t mean to be condescending but if you ever seen a zombie movie? You can’t just pick up the phone and call your friend. It’s the end of times. It’s the Apocalypse. [SIGHS] You ever see that zombie movie where the guy, -No. -uh, picks up the phone -and calls his friend? -Yes, I did. No, you probably didn’t 'cause -it never fuckin' happened. -I did, it was a great movie -No! There is no movie. -It was a great movie. -It was three minutes long. -I love that movie. -It's a three-minute-long movie. -You are unbelievably annoying! -Ah! -You are so annoying! Can we-- can we just sit here in silence? Can we do that? For a little bit? Wow... don’t spill any of this shit in the van or you’re paying for the deposit. Sparrow, can you say something so I know you heard me? Yes. Thank you. [ALARM BEEPING] Shit! It's-- it’s locked! It’s locked! Um... hold on! Burton! Hold on! Burton! -Hold on... I know! Hang on! -Sparrow! Use that. Use that. Hold on! Hold on! Hold on, hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Stay with us, stay with me. Sparrow. [GLASS SHATTERING] Sparrow! [GRUNTS] [COUGHING] Come on, Sparrow. Come on, wake up, come on. Come on, Sparrow! Come on. [PANTING] Hey, let me see what’s going on. Come on. Shh! Get me over there. Wheel me over there. Turn, turn, turn. Quiet. Shh, shh, shh. Oh, shit. -Where are we going? -I don't know, she was right there. -Who? -Look. Something happened. Something happened. Look. -BURTON: Come on, Sparrow. -CHARLIE: You see that? JAYHAWK: Yeah. What the fuck happened? -Come on. -What happened to her? -BURTON: Come on, come on -Stop-- BURTON: No, no, no, she’s gonna be fine! She’s gonna be fine! Come on Sparrow! Let's go! Come on! No! -Stop it. -No! Come on, Sparrow -Stop it. - [PANTING] BURTON: Your sister warned you... your sister warned you. [EXHALES] RAFI: You know, another thing, um that you can do Um, really helps the joints is you get, uh... this and you-- you lunge... with it... okay and just lunge it out. - [WHIMPERING] -You alright there? And back... nice and easy. It’s good, it keeps everything, you know, nice and-- [GASPS] nice and tight. You know, so, I mean not that you’d have to worry about like, tightness 'cause yours are so-- um, I-- I not that I was-- I wasn’t looking like I wasn’t like I'm I just sort of like from a distance like -You know, -Excuse me. 'cause I'm not like that guy at the gym, who’s like argh That’s not me at all. Not that you're like not like, gorgeous [LAUGHS] I’m not saying that’s like all you are like, like you probably study like, you know metaphysics or something like science or what am I saying [LAUGHS] sorry I was-- You don’t have to have a PhD. I’m just saying that you could be smart and not have a piece of paper. It’s... [STUTTERS] I'm not a pervert. Okay. Just get... Yeah, got it. - [THUDDING] - [BANGING] -Oh, my god! -RAFI: [WHIMPERING] It's good. Ugh... I can’t itch. [SIGHS] Charlie, what do you think, they’re gonna do? I don't know, What do you think tripped the GPS? -I don't know. -Tell me about M.A.N.A. I overheard you talking about it earlier. Did you hack into it or something? I just used it to turn the lights off. I don't have anything to do with any of this. Well, you didn’t happen to change any of, uh, M.A.N.A's other code, did you? No. I don’t think so. I mean, it was doing something weird. It was changing what I was typing while I was trying to type it. BURTON: That sounds like auto correct. Yeah, well. It wasn’t correcting typos or anything like that, it was making up completely new things that didn’t make any sense. That actually sounds like autocorrect. When you’re saying that this computer’s writing its own code? Computers can’t do that. Yes, they can. -CHARLIE: It’s a paradox. You-- -JAYHAWK: It’s not for computers Hey, hey, hey! Shut your mouth. I'm sorry, let me get this straight. We're stuck down here in this basement with these guys. Am I in the right ball park? -JAYHAWK: Sounds about right. -Okay, so you both work here? You know the ins and outs of this place, this business, how it works? CHARLIE: Are you asking for our help now? I’m asking if you would be so inclined to help us figure out a way to get the hell out of here. I would be so frickin’ inclined. -LEX: Fantastic! -CHARLIE: What?! No, wait. Wait! I mean, you break in here. You hold us hostage I mean, I can still taste my own blood. I’m sorry for your friend over there, but no. What? I'm supposed to forget all that now? -Yes. -Charlie. Right? I'm so sorry that we popped your corporate, Nine to five bubble. Lex, he's just a cog in the wheel. They are all cogs. Ignorance doesn't make you innocent. Charlie's actually not a cog. He's the manager. -LEX: Oh! Manager. -Thank you. I don't think that's what they're talking about So then you should be able to tell me what Thule sells? -Excuse me? -Thule. The company. -What's your product? -Web hosting, -email, mobile apps. -And what's it cost? -Nothing. It's free. -Exactly. That's not product. Yes, but it generates ad revenue. Ah! [LAUGHS] Okay, so, we don't pay anything... because we are not the customers. We're the product. Where you go, what you buy, who you hang out with, they know everything. and they store it all here. In like, places like this and they just wait to sell it to the highest bidder. CHARLIE: It can't be tracked back to an individual. It's anonymized. -And you're sure about that? -Yes. -LEX: Oh! -Yes. -It's company policy. - [LAUGHING] BURTON: This fucking guy. Company policy. You're so trusting. Still though, it's interesting that a company profits from ruining people’s privacy and they have so much to hide. I would like to finish this conversation in the parking lot. What do you guys think? Charlie? Charlie? Okay. Okay. Yes... okay. There's a crawl space over about three and a half feet just below us. We should be able to crawl through here to here. -LEX: Okay. -JAYHAWK: Okay. Uh, so, when we get out of here. You guys are just gonna go, right? No "throw me the idol, I'll throw you the whip" shenanigans. -None of what? -CHARLIE: He's asking -We wanna get outta here. -if we can trust you. LEX: No, obviously not, but we have weapons so... -Sounds reasonable. -CHARLIE: Okay, so there's an old AC system, right here. Uh, we crawl through this duct from here to here. -BURTON: And what's in there? -CHARLIE: The AC unit and from there, we can get to the elevators. What if we get stuck there? I don't want us to suffocate like Sparrow did. Yeah, well it's possible, but, uh, it's just as likely up here. It's a gaseous fire suppression system. Do you guys have any safety precautions in place? Yeah. Yeah, we've got oxygen masks. What'd you do with that box that came last month? Omega, like you told me to. CHARLIE: I asked you to put in a work order -to have them installed. -JAYHAWK: You never-- -Wait. -You put oxygen mask in Omega. -In Omega? -Yeah. ...where Sparrow just suffocated? Those would've come in handy then! -JAYHAWK: There's more to it. -The GFS is not just in the Omega Block. It's throughout the server room, alright? So that thing could go off any time. -Elevated heat, smoke-- -JAYHAWK: And like, in our situation it doesn't matter what I did. If-- if M.A.N.A decides to just flip a switch... BURTON: Oh yeah, in our situation. Our situation! -Yeah. -Then get the masks. -LEX: Go. -Okay. I think that's the biggest asshole -I've ever met. -Absolutely. Where-- [SIGHS] this-- [SIGHS] This is where you left them? There's only three. [SIGHS] You, me and the girl. Seems like I can eliminate a lot of the risk if I just go in there and unplug this thing. I don't want you going in there. That's what got Sparrow killed. Yeah, she didn't have a mask on. Yeah, well, the thing is dangerous. This whole building's dangerous. At least if I'm in there I can end this. Alright. Okay. We got them. Here you go. Wait. Wh-- what are you doing. What's going on. Can he not touch M.A.N.A like that? Are you serious? [SHRIEKS] You okay? BURTON: Uh, just some static electricity. -Just what? -What's up? The VODs are probably up too high again. -LEX: The what? -The, uh, nanoparticles. They're just uh nanoparticles, they help regulate the moisture in the air. Then he shouldn't be in there. Burton! JAYHAWK: No. It's not a big deal-- They're harmless. The most they can do is give you a little bit of a shock in case it gets too dry. Right, Charlie? Yeah, that's right. We set them in a goldilocks range so that, uh, they protect the servers. The servers don't get too dry or too moist. LEX: Well, Sparrow saw a rat earlier. -Yoshi. -One second it was running around and then it looked like somebody stuck a straw in it, sucked it dry. Yoshi. Wait a minute, th-- those nanobot things, they don't do that to people, do they? JAYHAWK: No. That can't happen. Right? ROXIE: Oh, are you okay? -RAFI: Yeah, I'm great. -Oh, it looks so bad. It's good, it's good, it's good. -I'm totally fine. -No, just sit down a sec. Sit. - [MOANS] -Careful. -Oh my god.... Sorry. - [SQUIRMS IN PAIN] No. It's okay. I have a high pain tolerance. You ate it. Gracefully. Probably, right? You're gonna live, sir. I think you're gonna live. [LAUGHS] Well, thank you, nurse. Hello, nurse.

An unprecedented leak of classified documents has brought diplomatic relations with both Russia and China to a boil. Our sources say the President is currently speaking with both countries leaders. The source of this gush of state secrets is, at this moment, still undetermined. Experts are calling this, a highly organized act of cyber terrorism and-- wait a minute... Hold on... okay... alright, I got it. I have just been informed that both China and the Russian Federation are releasing public statements denying any involvement and in fact claim, that they themselves have been similarly hacked. If this is confirmed, it will most likely be the most widespread cyber-attack in history. Stay tuned for more details. Bob, back to you. -Okay, we got it? Good. - [VIBRATES] Hold on a second. Hey, Mom. What's happenin'? [CHUCKLES] No, I'm at work. What pictures? Where-- where'd she get those? Video too... no, well, Dave and I, we're just friends. Hold on. Hey?

JAYHAWK: You see what's going on out there? That's M.A.N.A. That's us. I did that. -CHARLIE: No, Jay. -JAYHAWK: I did that.

[SIGHS] You're right. Crap. yeah, yeah. It's supposed to support us for 48 hours. JAYHAWK: 48 hours? CHARLIE: Yeah, it wouldn't matter anyway. M.A.N.A brought us to the brink of World War Three in one night. Who knows what would even be left in 48 hours. I don't know what else we can do. I could just hack back into M.A.N.A. I could insert a kill code. But, you said it yourself, it's writing its own code. It would just overwrite you. It's like I would need a whole other... it's like I would need a whole other M.A.N.A. That's it. Give me your phone. [RINGING] [PHONE BEEPS] -Hello? -Rafi! Why are you calling me? I wasn't anywhere. I didn't see anything.... My shift doesn't start until nine. I went straight home.

Put the news on... the news! [TV NEWS REPORT] Still there? I'm way too stoned for this. [CRYING] Don't leave me. -Rafi, Rafi. Calm down. -I don't wanna die. I've never seen Paris. Okay.

You could send Thule back to the 80s. -You were bragging about it. -What? You know that was just... that was hypothetical. Hypothetically, could you use your botnet to shut down -a data center, right now? -Yeah but I would never do that. I'd lose my job. I'd go to prison. I'd get ass raped. I'm Filipino. I'm hairless! I'm like a-- like an anime doll. Just hanging out in there. I'd get torn apart... -You know, whatever. -Hold on. I'm putting Charlie -on the phone. -Hey, Rafi. Hey, listen, uh, I can't believe I'm about to say this but could you execute a denial of service attack against Thule? -Really? -Yes really. You would literally be saving the world. Thunderstruck. Uh, yeah. I'm even thinking about forgoing the surprise drug test I had planned for Monday. [LAUGHS] Charlie, I knew you were cool, man. Uh, [CLEARS THROAT] Charlie, I have a confession to make. Uh, yeah. I have a botnet that could send Thule back to the 80's. [SIGHS] I was hoping you would say that Rafi. -Rafi? -Uh-huh? Do it.

CHARLIE: Love you. -Man, can you believe this? - [DIAL TONE] Hello? Charlie? Char-- Jayhawk? -He did it. -CHARLIE: Great. Alright. Now how are you gonna hack into M.A.N.A? The DDOS attacks are going to buy me enough time to hard line it with my laptop. Yeah but your laptop is in the Omega Block with M.A.N.A. What about the NDs? Uh, wear antiperspirant?

Let's see what you got, baby. [BEEPS] -CHARLIE: What? -You are breathing in my ear. Well... What was that? I don't know. I don't know. Don't worry about it. -What is it? -I'll check it out.
