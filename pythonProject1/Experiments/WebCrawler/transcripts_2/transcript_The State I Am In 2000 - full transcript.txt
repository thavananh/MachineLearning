Jeanne. - French? - And you? - Heinrich. - German... The surf isn't good today. Do you surf too? Everything OK? - Well? - What? Do you surf too? I have to go. - Where have you been? - In the bar. You been smoking? Did you get the CD? What did you do? Calculus. And my poetry recital. - How did it go? - Clara didn't like it. - Why not? - The wrong stresses. - Did anything happen? - Jorge wasn't there again. And now?. He'll be there Wednesday, I'm sure. What did you do with the money? A locker at the station. We have to get out of here, Clara. Lagos sounds good. There's a proper town nearby full of the usual drop-outs, potheads and tourists. That's the apartment. Three approaching roads, an underground car park... and lots of tourists. It's perfect. - And when? - On Sunday. Why do we have to move again? You said this place sucked. Don't tell me we're moving just because I said this place sucks! - What's the matter, Jeanne? - What do you think? Why has it suddenly stopped sucking here? Because I've got used to it! I'm going to my room. - What's wrong? - Nothing! - Did you do your translation? - I will! The tide. Rooftop. Nightmare. Breaststroke. It's an S sharp. What's the matter? - I'll go get some ice cream. - And the translation? There. North Shore or Sunset Beach. And before that maybe Malibu. Traveling with the waves. And you? Do you still go to school? But there are no holidays right now. I go to boarding school. Don't they have normal holidays? - It's in England. - Why there? You don't learn a thing at German schools. They're finished. - I have to go. - Why? I have to study. Shall we meet up tonight? Maybe. 11 o'clock at the old piazza. You're German? Translate good? Staffed aubergines? Stuffed, not staffed. Who was that? - A restaurant guy. - What did he want? - I corrected his German menu. - So he's Portuguese? - What's the matter? - Someone took pictures of us. - Who? - Clara followed them. Tourists. - You sure? - Yes. Welsh. Your translation is marvelous. Not just word for word. Beautiful. She translates menus now too. Oh come on! Staffed aubergines and stuff like that! - I corrected it! - We're leaving tomorrow. So what do your parents do? My parents fuck. For a living? No. Right now. Tell me something about you. Like what? Have you got brothers or sisters? What was school like? What do you do when you go out? Your favorite books? How many CDs do you have? What does your room look like? Close your eyes and try to imagine a villa in Hamburg. On the Elbe river. It's called the villa Stahl. My dad used to walk past it when he was young. And when he got rich he bought it for us. He wanted us to be happy there. The floors are warm. Under floor heating. In every room. My room is upstairs. But it's empty now. I can see the pool from the window. That's where my mother killed herself. Took sleeping pills. My father found her... floating near the pump. We moved out at once. The house has been empty since. Hide! Where were you? - You met someone. - Me? Me? Come on, Jeanne. Quit playing the dumb little girl. But how could I meet someone? I never get to know anyone! And next time close the door. I can't sleep with all that fucking! Police! Police! Come quickly! Shit. - Burglars! They've taken everything. - And the locker key? Gone! We must get to Lisbon! Staffed aubergines! We should have gone at once! Go left. Turn right. Feeling better? I'm really cold. - That looks awful. - Jeanne, we've got little money. - There's no way I'm wearing that! - It's cheap and warm. - But it's awful! - You'll fucking wear it anyway! This isn't a party! We're going to Germany. We'll be there in two days. We've enough for gas and food. We have to be careful. The car will make it. I'm sorry, Jeanne. I'm on edge. Let's go. Have we got any German money? A little. A coffee wouldn't be bad. What's that? A shake. Strawberry? Do you think we'll recognize him? If we can also be recognized... How much have we got left? Afew marks. 40 dollars. A couple of escudos. If he doesn't come, we'll try again tomorrow. He'll have his reasons. I'm going to the bathroom. We'll meet at the car. What's her name? Why don't you ask me? OK. What's your name? Is that your car out there? No, I leased it. Why? So that's why you're here? A little crash course in management? - It's deductible. - From taxes? What the fuck do you want? The state pays for your Mercedes? Should I visit my clients in a mini? You haven't got a clue. - Then show me what - - Leave me alone! Hans, drop it! You make me sick. Why didn't you come? I'm through with that kind of crap. What kind of crap? I could put you in touch with Benz. And then? What do we get? 10 years? 15? What else can you do? We need money. What for? - We have to get away. - Where to? To Yemen? You want to get her circumcised? Jeanne, please leave us alone. Excuse me. - I'm Jeanne. - Paulina. I saw you arrive. Is my dad down there? That's a sick shirt! What song was that? No idea. My boyfriend taped it. Can I hear it again? Sure. - Do you smoke? - Yes. Where are we going now?. We'll find a hotel and wait till tomorrow. But we haven't got any money! Where are you going? To the bridge. Shit! A history lesson: nobody wants those anymore. - And dollars? - 300. And when do we have to leave again? Oh, Mom! When morning comes... the father will return. He'll take his wife and children... and set them free. What's wrong with you? You look like a fucking gangster. Is that all? And the depots in Wuppertal? Those are the depots in Wuppertal. - We'll do a bank. - You're crazy. We have passports. All we need is money and the tickets. Not with Jeanne, Hans. Never. - We'll ask Klaus. - Klaus! Let's not start that again. What's that? Clothes. From the container. Let's get some sleep. Disinfectant. No boy will want to look at me now. That's good. We don't need anybody looking at us. Over-conformity attracts attention too. Let's go. About the Moby Dick translation: 4 o'clock would suit us fine. - You're Jeanne? - Yes. - Is it still far? - No. Have you ever read Moby Dick? - The original? - In English? No, I mean the unedited version, untouched by school teachers. What's that? Most of them cut the beautiful description of how everything is drawn to water... of how people who have lost their way... who are drifting... Klaus? - How long has it been? - A very long time. He hasn't changed. When you live in no man's land, you're stuck with your memories. We'd almost made it, Klaus. Money, passports, a new identity in S?o Paulo... Don't tell me anything. I'm a very weak man. They only need to keep my wine and after 3 hours I start blabbing. 4 hours on one of my better days. There must be lots of money left over from the book. Probably. Probably? What's that supposed to mean? Are you trying to kid us? I told you, didn't I? The company doesn't belong to me anymore. I'm not even on the board. I'm an alcoholic... and they only still employ me because of the little bit of history connected with my name. For that, I get 7,800 a month before tax. Give me three weeks. What for? S?o Paulo. I'll get you the money. Try to hold out. Jeanne doesn't look at all like him. How much? 1 ,200. For three weeks! That's impossible! - We'll make it. - Do you trust him? Yes. It's obvious why he wants to help you. - What did you say? - You heard. Stop the car. Stop at once! I can't anymore. No strength left. Jeanne, wait in the car. We'll be off in a minute. I know where we can stay. In a minute, Jeanne. I know where we can stay. That was number 3. If number 4 goes next, we'll go in. Down on the left. It will go out. Come on. It's cold. Come on, you bastard. - There's a pool here too. - I told you. Underfloor heating! So? Just like he told her. It seems OK. I'll go hide the car. Jeanne, come here. - And Dad? - He'll do the first watch. This house is our saving grace. Now it'll be all right. Why did you cry? - Old stories. - Is Klaus my father? No. You've really fallen in love, haven't you? Orjust a little? A little also hurts a lot. Here's the shopping list. Got a cigarette for me? You going to see the film too? On the assembly courtyard and all around the blocks grass has taken root agaln. A forsaken vlllage, stlll burdened wlth doom. The crematorlum ls not ln use anymore... the Nazl methods out of fashlon. Thls landscape... the landscape of 9 mllllon dead. Whlch of us wlll keep watch here and glve warnlng when the new henchmen arrlve? Wlll they really look that dlfferent from us? Somewhere, there stlll exlst offlcers who have been lucky celebrltles who are agaln ln demand, lnformers who have gone unnotlced and all those who never wanted to belleve lt or only from tlme to tlme. And we also contlnue to exlst, we who honestly belleve... that raclal hatred wlll be burled under these rulns. We, who stlll pretend to be fllled wlth new hope as lf we belleve that all thls ls restrlcted to only one tlme and place. We, who look past the thlngs beslde us and do not hear that the cry wlll never cease. I want your name. And I want to speak to your parents tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of this! What did you do last week? Forgotten, huh? But I know what I did! Chamberlain's appeasement tragedy up to the agreement in Munich. And there were two people in the classroom! Terribly hard work, reading 4 pages and answering 2 questions. But when it's movie-time, suddenly everybody shows up! Maybe you can say something about the film. Was it in color? Did it have sound? I'll take over. You're strange. Strange? Withdrawn. Do you love each other again? - I heard you. - I'm sorry. It's better than your fights. I always hated hearing my parents. There are worse things. Disappointed? No. Why? - This... - Not at all. Come with me. - Nothing was true? - Nothing. And about the villa? And Malibu? All lies. - And your mother? - I don't have any parents. Never seen any, never had any. I live in the Anne Frank hostel I've quit my apprenticeship. I'm a McJobber with surfer dreams and I love Brian Wilson. - That's the way it is. - Who do you love? Brian Wilson. Don't tell me you don't know him? What's with you? Why the disguise? It's not a disguise. I hardly recognized you. Did you join the Jehovah's Witnesses or what? Are those your Watchtowers? I'm sick of all this outfit shit. The supermodels, the poses and all that fucking exterior shit! So you're sick of it... What's the matter with you? That's enough now. Back to work. Wait a minute, this is my sister. I haven't seen her for 45 years! Then a couple more hours won't make much difference. Will you wait for me? I have a break in an hour. - What took you so long? - There was a line. On a Tuesday afternoon? What's wrong? Don't you believe me? That way they could be on to us. I'm sure they will, the way I look. Did you meet anyone? Are you crazy? That's the limit! Why are you lying? Spying on me. You're mad! No, you're mad! You stole these! So what? Just one security guard and it'll all be over! - Who is it? - What do you mean? You stole these to please someone. I stole them to please myself. You have just no idea. No idea about what? I already told Hans. These make me stick out but not that stuff. I'd look just like everyone. - And that's what you want? - Yes! You'll get it soon. You just have to be patient. You've been saying that for years. Soon, soon, soon! I want it now! Shit. Only a few days more and we'll make it. Just a little bit of self-control. Atiny little bit! OK, OK. You're right. Here. Now go and get dressed up. You look nice. I'd never forbid you anything but boys and stealing clothes... Please, not now. Or else we're done for. Can you promise me? Yes. I promise. I'm sorry. Can you give me a lift? I can't. But you smiled at me. You reminded me of someone. But I've been here for ages. Please. I really can't. I'm sorry. Police! Don't move! Police! Get down! Down, I said! Something must have happened. And what, may I ask? Maybe he hasn't been able to get it all. - Why isn't he here to tell us that? - I don't know. We'll send Jeanne to him. Shit! What will they do to Klaus? They'll work on him for months. And then? He needs only to keep his mouth shut, to keep silent... During interrogations, if you keep silent... if you can keep that up, it drives them crazy. They need you to talk and will try anything: yelling, jokes, flattery... All they want is a reaction but, if they don't get that... they implode. It's the only weapon you've got left. I'll go and get breakfast. No. But there's nothing left to eat. The money's all gone. You shouldn't smoke. Where did that come from? The change from a shopping trip. I'd forgotten about it. I always used to keep the change too. For books. It was for a CD. I used to buy lipstick too. Where's Dad? In town. Without money? - He's looking at something. - At what? Later. This is the best place to park the car. Hardly anybody around in the morning. When does the bank open? Nine. What's it like inside? Jeanne has to check it once more. The pedestrian area sounds bad. There's a side door leading out to the parking lot. And it's open? Jeanne has to check it. Good. Time for bed. I'll do the first watch. I waited for you. Why did you leave? You come and go and never say a thing. What's that? I thought that was ''outfit shit''? I made a mistake... in my thinking. - Have you slept with many girls? - No. Four, perhaps. Or maybe only three. But that didn't mean anything. It just happened. And you? Why don't we talk about you? Where do you always go to? Why do you wear disguises? Why are you scared? And why do you lie? Your parents are in a sect. You give each other massages and listen to crappy Indian music... and cry out in ecstasy. But nobody knows Brian Wilson. That is Brian Wilson. A gift for you. Did I do something wrong? Was it disgusting with me? Nothing compared to the ritualistic fucking in your cult, huh? Right? So I'm right? No, my parents were right! What's it got to do with your parents? When you're weak and confused... you have to keep silent and let the other do the taIking. All that about your other girls made me jealous and weak. But you have to keep silent... and let the other do the talking. That will drive him crazy... and make him break apart. Implosion. Your parents taught you that? This is piss warm. Shall I get you a coke? I'll get you one from the machine. It's beautiful, the morning in the woods. It starts when the light reaches a certain level. 5,600 lux. Or 6,000. I forget which. - Doesn't matter. - Fuck! How old is he? Who? Stop acting the dumb kid: Who? Me? Why? Was it your first time? What's it to you? Mind your own fucking business! You have no idea what's at stake here. Where did you meet him? Other kids can at least run away if someone hits them. Where did you meet him? In Portugal. In Portugal? And now he turns up here and you think nothing of it? It was me who followed him. I wanted to see him again. I don't understand. He told me about the villa. He doesn't know anything. He's an unemployed mechanic. Are you in love with him? Why do you want to know?. When you're in love, at some time you tell each other everything. So think carefully. - Can I have some water? - This isn't an interrogation. - We must know where we stand. - It is an interrogation. I've told you he knows nothing and that I haven't told him anything but you don't believe me and so I'm not telling you any more. It's none of your business. She's in love and we're trying to break her down. We have to take her to Katharina. When we're gone and it's calmed down, you can follow us. You're lying! It's impossible. This is no life for you. You can't love someone and live in hiding. And you? You love each other! We both live in hiding. But you made a child. You made me. Is that possible? You shouldn't have. Now you want to take it back after 15 years! You should go to a normal school... swap clothes with your friends, skip classes. Shit! After 15 years? You can't do that! I'll never see him again. I want to stay with you. I don't love him. I never want to see him again. I want to be with you. I don't love him. Then we take this track to the B-5 and hit the Autobahn on to Le Havre. You'll be driving and Jeanne next to you. Everything OK? Have another look at it. Is everything correct? And this side door Ieads out to the parking lot? Yes. And it was open? Tomorrow night we'll be in Le Havre. And two days later on board the ship. A sea crossing like that is quite long. We can start with lessons again. You can choose a beautiful new name. You'll be able to go to a real school. And you'll fall in love again. I'm sure of it. Yes, Mom. l will. Don't touch me! - Are you here with your parents? - Didn't you hear? Piss off! - Piss off! - What's the matter? You make me sick, that's the matter! Leave me in peace! And don't you dare touch me! Don't you get it? I don't love you! I never loved you! You and fucking Brian Wilson and your fucking surfer dreams! - You're so disgusting! - Jeanne, stop it! Just go and scrape out your pans! You're so... dumb... and so little... just like a boring, stupid... guy! I'm sorry. But that's the way it is. Piss off! Why aren't you in the car? Not so fast. That's the wrong way! We're going back to the house. Give me the alcohol. Open it! The side door was closed. It was open, I swear. How much is it? I don't know. How's Dad? He won't develop a fever. We'll leave tomorrow morning. During the rush hour traffic. If we wait, they'll have analyzed the gun and the whole area will be closed down. When I was there, the side door was open. Jeanne, I shot a man. I love you. My parents forced me to do it. Please, believe me. All I can think of is you your kisses, your smell and your stories. I don't go to a boarding school in England. You're right. We have to be honest with each other. My parents and me... We belong to a cult. And it's super strict and it's very difficult for me. - You're lying! - No. Stop lying! - No, it's true. - But I don't believe you! I don't know who or what you are. But it was you who robbed the bank today. I'm right. Who are you? OK, then get out. Go. We live in hiding. What kind of hiding? Why did you come back here again? My parents are leaving soon. And you? They're waiting for me. Where are you hiding? In the house you told me about. And if you go back there... we'll never see each other again? Do you want to stay with me? But they would never allow it? Do you want something to drink? But when I come back you'll still be here? I will stay with you. I went to see him again. I wanted to stay with him. But I couldn't.
