foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- That way. Use your right foot. Well done, man. Straight on. Go! Switch sides. Fuck! Jay! Pass it to me. Over here. Ref, what is this? Come on, man. Get in position! Unbelievable. You lose sight of your man, time and time again. You give the ball away on simple short passes. Not just once, but at least ten times! It's embarrassing. In your own stadium, in front of your own supporters. So maybe you should all take a moment to take a good look at yourself. But whatever. Just a thought. - Why can't we just clear it? - Are you talking to me? - Just kick them out of the box. - You should have covered your guy. We're 1-0 up and you start fucking around in the box. - Fuck you! - Tony, shut the fuck up! Thierry, you too. Everybody should just shut his mouth! He's right. We were all fakes, today. We had to stop. - Couldn't you drive? - No. "My brother," he says… Why couldn't you drive? - The third light is green. - Hey. It's green. The man stops! He grabs that thing. And he saw it happen. So he starts running like Speedy Gonzales. - We all laughed. - Hey. Get outta here. There he is, our little football star. - I'm here for Marcus. - He's in the Maldives. When he gets back, tell him I have his money. Hey, kiddo, get back here. - How's things? - Fine. You? - I'm here to borrow money. - I thought you were bringing some. I thought he went snorkeling. - How much? - Twenty. How much do you make at that club these days? Thirty, forty? Enough to always pay you back. And yet you're here, begging. Go home, son. Then give me 50. Do you want to make some money, or not? Sure. But if you lose it, you're mine. Eleven. Twenty. Pass. Fourteen. Back. Play? Blackjack. Play? Play or stand? Split the aces? Do you want to split the aces? Twenty. Nineteen. Ten. Twelve. Fifteen. Twenty-one. Hey. How are things? Good. She hasn't performed yet. - Is she nervous? - Yeah. I'm glad you came. - Hey, Pocahontas. - Dad! What's wrong? My stomach aches a little. How come? - What if everyone thinks I can't do it? - Come here. If you don't want to do it, you don't have to. But then you're going to bed without supper. - Everything will be okay, sweetheart. - Yeah. This covers last and this month's. It's okay. - Did you see me? - Hi, sweetie. - It was beautiful. - Thank you. - Really. - I'm super proud of you. It was really great. Is Daddy staying for dinner? - Tonight, I have to help a friend. - Okay. - Next time, okay? - Okay. Let's go. Bye, Dad. Bye, sweetheart. Let's go. Bye. Hey, Jay. What is this? I thought we had an appointment. I want to introduce you someone. I should have called you. Sit down. Listen to what this guy has to say, okay? - Is that right? - Well… Jay, what are you doing? I spoke with them. They can't really say where they're heading next year. - What do they want to do? - Change it up. Attract young players. - Without me, their defence is useless. - I feel you. Chances are we'll relegate. What can they do? What you need to ask yourself is: what are you going to do? - For whom are you arguing? - All I'm saying is… Why choose a club that's going to pieces when you get an offer like that? Talk to the club. Do your fucking job. - Safe flight. - Jermaine. Jermaine? Coby. Hey, sweetheart. - Could you wash these for me? - Are you still kicked out? - It didn't work out. - It will be fine. I had a dream about us last night. We were in the colosseum, dressed in our football kits. We were chained together and had to fight a lion. But the lion's head was a football. Every time we kicked the ball, another lion would appear. Fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty lions. - Fell asleep during The Gladiator again? - This is where you eat. It's self-service, so help yourself. Gentlemen, let me introduce you to Brahim and Mark. - Hi. - Good luck. - This way. - Well done. - Yes. - Over here. Hey. Push. Nice ball, Slagter. Turn around. Keep up the pressure, black! Push up, Slagter! Come on. Hey. Can you take those two from the youth team under your wing? - Show them around? - Are they any good? I hope so. We're going to need them badly next season, I'm afraid. - What are you afraid of? - Just look after them. Show them, Brahim. Tight pass. Good. Now close him down. Great! That's it. Jermaine, focus. Give me a tight pass. Good job. - Are you okay? - It's nothing. - You sure? - Yeah, it's fine. No man, go and see Roy. Go inside. Okay, next ball, get ready. Tight pass. Good receive. Any pain? - And if I move it like this? - No, nothing. I'd still skip tomorrow's practice and take a rest. No, that's not necessary. I just stumbled a little. Okay. - If the pain returns, we'll do an X-ray. - Sure. - What did Roy say? - It's fine. Need to take it easy. We'll have to keep our eye on that. What are your thoughts on the new guys? Smart kids. Fast learners. - I think you have a lot to teach them. - I think so too. Have you ever thought about the future? We're looking for a coach for the youth team. You'd be perfect for it. You'd be able to make them better. Those guys listen to you. They look up to you. Am I making sense? Guido started the same way. We work with a lot of ex-players in the youth program. So then you think of me? Hello, sweethearts. Hello, my babies. My little bitches. Did you sleep well? Did you behave? Yeah? I'm looking for a new buyer. - Didn't you have a deal with the Turks? - Fuck them. They rip you off to your face. - Isn't ripping off always to your face? - You know what I mean. Maybe you can help me out? He doesn't deal with clowns. - He would if you asked. - Forget it. - Come on, it's just one call. - I don't talk to him, Kev. I might as well make a soup out of them, then. - What do you think of China? - As a country? As a competition. Don't know a lot about that. Just that they've got money galore. Would you go, if they asked you? Of course. But hey, I'm a little slut. Yeah, you like getting screwed. Over here we get screwed too. They just pay better. Dammit. This fucking kid! Hey. What's wrong with you? You gave your dad a heart attack. - I didn't know you were in there! - What? - Big mouth. Get in the goal. - You get in the goal! Come on, get in the goal. - I'm going to score. - You wish. - Yes. - Good job. Yeah! Yes. - Tell Deb I'm sorry. - Hey. - Next time I'll stay for dinner. - Come on, Jay. - I swear. - Typical Dutch move. Get in, pal. - I've got a match. - Maybe we want to take you. Take your pick: back seat or the trunk. Come on, move it. What is he doing here? That's between you and me. My treat. I'm not hungry. It's just one game. I've already forgotten about it. I gamble and I play football. I don't mix the two. Wake up, man. With what are you going to pay me back? Okay. In three weeks from now, I'll walk in with a hundred grand. Okay. But if you don't, we're doing it the Chinese way. - That'll be 63.20. - Keep the change. - Thanks. Want a receipt? - No, thanks. FC BARKAS WHERE THERE'S A WILL, THERE'S A WAY Dré. Benji. Just shoot, dammit. Go deep. - Come on, ref. - Come here. Number 22. Stop it, you got it? - Cover the striker. - Captain. Ref! - Let go of my shirt. - Stop whining! Jay, keep your head in the game! What clouds are you in? Come on. Hey! Are you out of your fucking mind? Dad, hurry! We'll be late. Come on. - Is Mom still mad? - I don't know. What do you mean, "I don't know"? Just, you know, I don't know. - Don't be mysterious. - I'm not. - Tell me. - No. You're my little spy, right? She has been sad. - She quit school. - Why? Maybe she's also scared she can't do it. Smartass. - Why are we driving this way? - I don't know. - I'm going to pass you. - Stop. - Can we also take a few sitting down? - Sure. That's going to cost you more, though. Come on. Right. Hold your thumb a little higher. - Can you sit in the chair? - Yes. - Hey. What do you want to eat? - Sushi. Great, sushi. Jermaine. Good luck on Saturday. Here, sweetheart. Come on. Take off your coat. The other side too. - Sorry we're home this late. - No problem. - How was her horse-riding lesson? - It went well. We went for sushi afterwards. Was she able to use chopsticks? No. She still can't. I hope she never learns how to. - When I first saw you, I thought... - Don't. I'm going to bed. "She's way too smart for me." "Within five minutes, she'll realize I have the brains of a goldfish." So for our first date, I memorized 20 Trivial Pursuit cards. Just to impress you. - Did you know the capital of Uganda... - Kampala. I don't know anyone who is smarter than you. Don't drop out of school. When I need a lawyer someday, I'll need to be able to call you. No, everything is possible. Yes, everything. I'll take care of everything, okay? That's right. Okay, bye. Weirdo. - You okay? - Yeah. - Want a Pellegrino? - No, thanks. This office suits you well. I'm just trying to do my job. If you're here for your contract, sorry, I have no news yet. - I'm here for something else. - Whatever you need. I'm in some debts. How much? - A hundred. - A hundred? - I know it's asking a lot… - What are you asking exactly? I'm asking for your help. I don't have a hundred grand, Jay. You know that as well as I do. - What do you have? - Listen. There's a great deal on the table. The Chinese are very generous. I'm sure we can get them to give you an advance. - You don't want to do business with them. - Why not? He's here to buy games, not players. What do you mean? You knew. You knew all along. You have no idea what you're talking about. Sorry, but you're a junkie. A hundred grand? I'm doing you a favor. Sign the contract, take the money, and do what they ask. Consider it a paid vacation to get your shit together. Or stay and live your life like you do now. Okay? But don't bring me your fucking bullshit. Just play their little game, Jay. - It's just fucking football. - Fucking football? Esmee is going to be mad if you don't come. Yeah. Lovely. - Mom, can you please come? - Another time. That other time my sister is getting married? Come on, munchkin. Let Mom do her homework. Hi everybody, this is one of the strangest days of my life as a dad. It saddens me to give my little girl up to another man. But Esmee, I have never seen you happier than you are today. And Sander… You are my son. Take care of my little girl. Congratulations. Was this really the best moment to congratulate me? Easy, I was joking. You went all-out. My princess is only getting married once. I wouldn't be so sure about that. You're talking about your sister. My half-sister, yeah. If you don't want anything to do with this family, why are you here? I want Joy to be here. Don't use your daughter as an excuse. Be straightforward and tell me what you want. What do you need from me? You're not the first person in my life to come begging me for help. Enjoy your evening. Jermaine. Buy your daughter something nice. - Come on, let's go. - Why? We're leaving. I think we're going to stay. Slagter. Wake up, man. Hey, Slagter. Look at how fucked up this guy's life is. Holy shit. - Come here. - Are you crazy? Do you want me to punch you in the face? Fuck off. Did you have a chance to think about our talk? - What talk? - About next season. Have you thought about next season? Make no mistake, you and I need each other more than you think. If you don't want to train teens yet, at least help me keep the team together. - I've still got it. - Okay, then show me. - Straight on. - Go on. - Pass it to Peter. - Jandino. Hey! Switch it up. Put some pressure on them. Play on. Younnes! Hey. Come on. Are you okay? - What the hell did you do? - Hey. Knock it off. - What the hell? - Hey. - You better watch out. - Calm down. What do you mean, pal? - I just went for the ball. - Just calm down. - Don't let them get to you. - Idiots. - Funny, coming from you. - Hey. Watch it. Exactly where I aimed. You need to focus. Look at where you hit the ball. Hey, pussies! It's way too easy like this. Try again. Focus. Look at what you're doing. Look at where you hit the ball. See? That's it. Want me to take the obstacles away? It'll be easier. You can stay here, if you want. Stay over. Sleeping in a hotel, that's no… There we go, fresh fries. If we put the boys in the same room, he can sleep in Lars' room, right? - I think not. - Why not? He'll crawl into our bed and we'll have a much bigger problem. I don't see the problem. Hey. Don't get any ideas. Hey, Slagter. We can't do that, Deb. You see how sensitive he is. - Yeah, yeah. Fuck you, bro. - Fuck you, bro! No. We're not going to repeat what Dad says. It's the fifth time this week. - He's not a baby anymore. - That's why. Be a good example. Why not sell the house? You're divorced, right? I can't make Joy homeless. - Besides, it's more urgent than that. - How urgent? Ten days. - I'll pay back every cent, I swear. - How? How do you plan to do that? You haven't even thought about it. There may be something… Hey. - How are you? - Fine. You? - Is my dad back there? - Yes. This stuff was harvested too early. You have plenty of friends who won't care, don't you? Are you two partners? - They're Kevin's plants. - What's in it for you? I'm helping him. Such a noble guy, my son. Did you know he once won a prize? He was ten years old. Back then, during the half-time of competition matches, they'd hold contests for the youth players. Who could do keepy-uppy the longest? Jermaine competed. My little guy in that big stadium. And while all his teammates dropped the ball, he kept going. Until it was just him and another boy. They were neck and neck. Two hundred, three hundred, four hundred. Right before they reached 500, the other boy makes a mistake. Jermaine is the only one left. But instead of going on, he kicked it one more time, and then put the ball down himself. After the match, he comes to me to show me his medal, bursting with pride. And I asked him, "Why did you stop?" And he looked at me and said… What did you say, again? He said, "Because it's not fun for the other kids if I'm too good." That's when I knew: my son is never going to make it. I did my best to help him. In that he shouldn't be afraid to be the best. But he didn't listen! He didn't want to! Jermaine, if you need money, just ask me like a man. And spare me the bullshit. And don't bring me crap like this. This is everything they wanted to give me. Sorry, man. - Hey, pal. - Hi, how are you? - Fine. How are you? - Great. - How much do you want? - Never mind. Show more initiative. Great. Hey, Slagter. I want to hear that ball. Get that ball in the goal. Nice kick. Slagter, hey! Nice kick, man. Come here. Yeah. These are stronger than the last, so I recommend you halve the dose. Okay. - This is 400 exactly. - Great. There you go. Yes, that's it. Come on, what colour do you want? - I guess red. - Watch this. You missed. False start, watch this. Go get change for this. Joy, where were you? - You can't just run off. - Sorry. - Where did you get that? - Someone gave it to me. - Who? - That man over there. Stay here. Hey, stupid fuck! You stay away from my daughter, you hear me? Stay away! Sweetheart, look at me. Look at me. Joy. Don't you dare! What did you do? What happened? - What happened? - Nothing happened. Nothing? Nothing. I had an argument with a guy and she was there. Calm down. Calm... - Just calm down. - Calm down? This is your daughter. Crying inside. - She's just a little scared... - Don't you dare talk to me like that. - Calm down! - Fuck you! Calm down. Easy… I'm trying so hard not to hate you. What you do. Who you are. How you treat your own child. I had a dream where you were dead. And I didn't even care. Jermaine. You have to do something for me. I need your help. I need you to bet on something. It's not about gambling. I need you to bet on something I have to do. And then it's over. All of it. Then it will stop. I swear. Did you do it? - Naomi. - Yes. Red card for number 22, second half. And some little bets on some other stupid stuff. What the fuck are you doing? We just started five minutes ago. Hey! Calm down! Hey! He's shirt-pulling. BARKAS, NUMBER OF MINUTES, GUESTS Hey. Ref! Yeah! …for number nine, Jimmy Tayuchu. Player substitution: number 22, Jermaine Slagter is out. He is being replaced by Brahim el Amraoui, number two. Hurry up, Slagter. If I ever see you near my little girl again… I swear. One hot chick you have… - What did you say? - That your chick is hot. There's something I want you to see. Yeah… If you shit where you eat, make sure nobody smells it. I know… that hurts. If you'd listened to the Chinese guy, you would've made some money on the side. Next Sunday, you're going to lose for us. You don't want your pretty girl in the papers, right? Or do you? - How? - Figure it out. I'm not alone on the pitch. That's easily fixed. Now get out. That's way more than I gave you. I have to lose Sunday's match. - You're joking, right? - I have no choice. It's all fucked up. - I can't do it alone. - You know what happens if it gets out? - Ninety minutes and we're done. - You don't get it. I'm not talking about you. How do you think I ended up here? The bag has 20 grand. After the game you'll get another 20. - Jay, I can't do this. - Kevin. Fix your own problems. - They won't take no for an answer. - Jay, forget it. Good to know I'm not the only one with secrets. Men, it's Reijnpoort tomorrow. A tough team. We looked at the stats. From the last ten games with them we lost six. Three draws. So how many times did we win? - Kooije? - What? Once, very good. Glad you're paying attention. But those are just the numbers. Tomorrow is a match on its own and remember, Reijnpoort has nothing to fight for. We do. It's all or nothing. We either stay in the league, or we're out. So we're coming out fighting. We want to show our supporters. We play to win. - Okay, come on. - Coach. What the hell is this? - Brahim is starting. - I can see that. But why? You don't have your shit together. - What do you mean? - I'm not discussing this. Faster. Stay open. Good ball. Black, stop losing the ball. - Stay with your man. - Hey. That's it. - Everyone. - Get that ball. - Come on. - Black, push up. - Lost the ball. - Hey. Good. Stay out wide. Congratulations on your starting spot. I wanted to give you some advice. - You should skip this Sunday. - Doesn't the coach decide on that? Listen. I want you to call him tomorrow and say you got food poisoning. - Are you threatening me? - Think what you want. You're a good player. You have a future. But this match is important to me, you understand? Don't worry. After this, I won't bother you again. Hey. What do you mean, "hey"? Little man. Aren't you the son of that goalie? Don't be afraid. I have a present for your daddy. Look. Now hurry on home, okay? There's a lot of creeps around here after dark. Due to circumstances, we had to make changes. This means Slagter, you're back playing right back. We're playing 3-4-3… - Jermaine! - Coming. We're losing this match. But you and I, we're done. It has come to this. It all comes down to this match. The future of this club. Be prepared to die for two periods of 45 minutes. Because this, here, now, is everything that matters. No excuses. No mercy. We're the team who's going to show them right away who's boss. We're grabbing them by the throat and won't let go. We'll eat them alive. Come on. Come on. - Hey. - Hello. - Are you at the Barkas-Reijnpoort match? - Yes. Make sure you have a clear view of the pitch at all times. - Okay. - And don't lose your connection. The kick-off.
