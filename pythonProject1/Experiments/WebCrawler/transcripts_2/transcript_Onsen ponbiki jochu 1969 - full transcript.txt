Oh, Maruyama! I am finally here! Hey, how did it go? I've completed the research in advance Really? It's such a great place and nobody knows about it. It's just so good. Good job. Good job! Okay, tonight, let's do-do-do it! - Please. - Okay, let's go! Authentic Cuisine - Ocean Observation Tower It's time now. Please keep it up! Yes! A call for you! Yes? A nude play? Would just watching be okay? By the way, we have a good girl. Ah? Yes. Thank you very much. Okay. Hey, Anna is replacing Aya for this month. Huh? Did she go back home? For appendix surgery, No choice them It's her third time, isn't it? Hey, Iku's good performance helps a lot, doesn't it? Of course, it's because we've been taking care of her since she was 16. Her younger sister was thankless and rebellious, though. I remember when Mimi, her younger sister, was an elementary school student. People should help each other, right? Huh? What are you talking about? Yo! Ah, mister! No, you are not supposed to go in there. Don't be mean. We writers feel somewhat lonely after finishing a job. Please distribute this script for me. Your dairy from hidden onsens is really popular. It's nothing but a roughly-written script But if I distribute it, I'll get several hundred thousand Such a good business. Roughly-written? That's mean. Hey, have you seen this kind of picture? - You are dirty. - Stop saying that I will seduce you slowly tonight, Yes. I see. The big room! One more sake! What is your answer? I am too busy to spend time with you. Did you hear the sake order? - Huh? The sex play? - The sex play? Please be quiet If you have something like that, please show me. Whatever. Are you going to buy me? I want to see something from Communist China or the Soviet Union. - Maruyama! - Yes. Where is the cuisine filled with all those delicious ingredients? The narrow space is filled with a lot of ingredients! Five of them! - No! - Are you available? - I have to bring this to... - No, no need. I... Huh? - Hey! Her boobs are too big. - Too big? - The bowl might fall down. Please. - Cute! Are you going to touch them? The bottom is available. Hey! You only snatch the good ones! - It feels good. - The bowl might fall down! I'm scared! Let me go! What are you doing? Hey! Hey! Hey! I can't see! - I will leave it to you. - Okay. - That, right? - Okay. It's luxurious. It's luxurious... What is that? Menu! Sexy Menu! Sexy Menu? I like it. No, President! There are a lot of younger, cuter and more glamourous girls downstairs. More food gives more energy! - Eat as much you want. - Yes. I will leave it to you. Mister! Please wait! You! I love you! What are you doing? We, as a Union, have been trying hard to improve the image of our onsen town. However, it has gained a reputation as a sex-play onsen lately. This is unacceptable. Therefore, I need your suggestions. What do you think, Mr. Shirahama? I totally agree. I think this is much ado about nothing. We need to enforce the Prostitution Act. We have to push harder this time. Are you kidding me? They can say that because they're snatching the newly-weds and the group tourists. What about us? Look! They built a big building like that next to us, If we stop advertising as a sex-play ryokan, how can we earn money? But the Union just wants you to respect the Prostitution Act. Stop mentioning the Union. Do you know who made you the director on the Union? If you hadn't married me, you'd be a bum wandering the streets right now. You always bring up my past She is right, mister. Every guest, including the newly-weds, is hereto enjoy a specific activity. What is wrong with letting them enjoy themselves? The girls are happy, we earn money. The business becomes prosperous There is nothing better than this! You are right, It doesn't matter where you go in Japan... if you visit an onsen, you watch the strip show and fuck a cute girl. Isn't that right? - Well... that's... - Honey! Wait a sec. Wow, is this the 5-million-yen truck? You finally bought it? I only paid 2 million though. This is mine. What are you talking about? I paid 1 million too. I know. Yours is mine. Mine is yours, right? That's right. I gave you everything I had. - Hey, Hide! - Huh? Take me to the construction site, Okay. - Are you going somewhere? - Let me join! - See you. - Sister! - Hey! Don't touch the car! - Be careful! - Thanks. - See you. See you! - Miss! - Yes! - 10 eggs. - Yes. - Thanks. - Thank you very much. Why did you buy this many? Can you eat them all? We are celebrating the purchase! Eat as much as you want! When I look at this, I think of our childhood. I was waiting in front of the chicken with my younger sister... and a white one came out I told mom about it. I wanted to eat it. I decided I would eat a lot of them when I grew up. I know. That's why I eat a lot of them. Do your best, Hide! Leave it to me. Unlike other drivers, the more I earn, the more money you will see in your pocket You can see the company getting bigger over there. The transport company will be mine soon, You will become the president of the transport company, I will... The president's wife... Hide! I've missed this, Sabu! I've missed this a lot. Mimi, aren't we there yet? Soon! They are waiting for us, Sabu! Last spurt! Okay! That way! Brother is here! Brother! Cool! - Longtime no see! - Brother! Long time no see! Long time no see!

What a great girl... Whose mansion is this? None of your business! - We have a cute girl in here. - Not so fast. I am a veteran in this field. My taste is very refined. I see. Please don't worry. Please go ahead, Please go ahead, Huh? Welcome, - Enjoy, mister. - Okay. Good job. Hey, a geisha is supposed to wear panties, You know the saying ”Beauties live short lives”? My underwear had a short life as well. Hey Mister, come on! Hurry up! Let me use this. This is strange, But it gets me excited. I want people to watch us in order to excite me more. Can I call them? I can't refuse you. Go ahead, It's fine. Please. Oh, that's too many! They just want to watch. Sorry for interrupting your fun. If you want to keep watching, you have to pay 1,000 yen each. If your husband comes back after drinking, what do you say? Okay, I will show you one more session, Listen! We, the Kanto Shoryukai, have come here all the way from Tokyo... in order to earn money to maintain our clan in an onsen town. He is right. We can satisfy these horny guys without any competition from Tokyo. Let's earn a lot from this sex business! We'll restore our clan's power until the brothers get released. Things will get better then. Do your best Safuro Onsen - Nanki Sandy Beach Sight Please wait a sec. Sister! It's Mr. Yamanobe! Shit! That bastard! Mister? Yo! You guys... This is the perfect opportunity. Where did you stay last night? - Weird girls seem to like you... - Seriously! Iku! I've wanted to tell you this! Every guy is a horndog. In other words, your guests are these girls, guests too. Is that why you're flirting with this ugly blonde slut in the sum? He just can't ignore our vibrant youth. Right, mister... You guys are from that dirty business called New Naples aren't you? You are outsiders here, so keep quiet! Hey there! You seem upset! - Are you the boss bitch in this area? - I know you guys. You're a gang from Tokyo. - Whatever. - What are you doing? What do you want? Let me go! Stop it! Let me down! Wait! Stop! Stop! What are you doing? Let's toss her in too! Yeah! - One, two... - Please stop! - One, two... Shut up, bitch! - What are you doing? Stop! Let me go! You... Didn't you hear me? Michiko! You are Michiko, aren't you? Michiko... Sister... Longtime no see. How many years have passed? You suddenly went missing when you were a middle school students Do you have any idea how much I worried about you? Do you hear me? Now you're back but you've become a yakuza's mistress. Don't you think that's pathetic? Sister! I hate being pooh You used to tell me that too, right? That doesn't make it OK to become a yakuza member! They are disturbing our business! I don't know how to tell the Madam. When our mother passed away, Madam saved us, We were nothing but ordinary middle school students! I admit that she helped us graduate from middle school! But I couldn't go to school on time because I was too tired from work! I can't even count every incident! Your mindset is outdated. I realized that in Tokyo. There is no one I can rely on but myself. Every guy wants me. What is wrong with using my body as a weapon? What you are doing isn't good enough. Even our late mother told us once... Women survive as long as they can use this here properly. - Michiko! - Miss! The baby pissed itself! It's totally wet, Sleeping and peeing are a baby's job. What a weird guy, right? Michiko! Did you really? I had no choice, I don't know who the real father is because I slept with so many guys. - Go wash this, - Yes! But I'm sure she's my baby, I will prove that I can raise her properly. I will do anything to raise Hiroko. I won't even lose to you. I will win back all of our guests... and add the guests of New Naples too! Do it if you can! Thank you for boarding today... - How was it? - Yamaguchi is absent Great Do your job right! Okay! - Please do this, - Put it there. - Do your best - Yes. And do it right. Welcome to the Ocean Observation Tower! It's unfortunate... I've already decided to go to New Shirahama. We offer special services tonight, - Special services? - Yes! Will you show us a performance and add girls? Of course! No! You are horny! No! This is great news! Excuse me! Sorry for being late, Let's start right away. Sorry. Please let them in too. Please help us, Ken, what are you doing? Hug me too. Me too! More... No, don't! No, move aside! Hey! Hey, Mimi! - Hey, Mimi! Wanna get in? - I will give you a ride! Hurry up! Thank you! I will take his car! Bye! How mean! Would you give me a ride to New Naples? I have a big crew. Just let them sit in the back. You must be Mimi, Iku's younger sister. You know about us? I guess sisters have the same taste. Hurry! Don't peek, you perv! - Hurry! - Don't touch me, you idiot! Hurry up. Let go! Hurry! I know! - Hold on tight, -I will! What a perv! Let's go. Excuse me, I'll buy this. Yes. Where is she? Sister! - What's up? - New Naples snatched some of our girls! What? Hideo transported them with his truck. She is right. What should we do, sister? This is tough. I've brought Iku's girls. What are you mumbling about? Cheer up! What's wrong? Sisters have the same job? - How pathetic... - Hey... Please drink. I don't know how much you earned there. I will give you twice that here. Please let me hear your requests if you have any. Our request is to start working right away. That's all. If you don't like it, you can leave. The deal is done. You seem upset. What's up? - What are you doing? - How about you? This is a dirty trick! Sister! This is all about business! How about asking your girls where they wanna work? Sorry. I will get twice the wage. It's all about money, isn't it? We can even take a break sometimes. That's what she said. You are naive. You are being fooled! They are yakuza! You are not supposed to do this, Such a pathetic woman, Hey! What are you doing? Let me go! Stop it! Let me go! Hey, what are you doing here? Hey! What's up? Hide! Stop! Huh? Are you her boyfriend? I knew you'd be on her side. Michiko! You are no longer my younger sister! If you say so. I feel more comfortable now. Hey! You may leave with her now. So many people here. I'll let you go today. - Hide... - How generous... Your beer tastes like piss! Brother! I am saying that I wasn't careful. You should know that our business relies on those girls! I am apologizing now! - Good, I found them. Let's go! - Okay! Bastard! Hide! Stop! Idiot! - Gang members, right? - Yeah. - How unfortunate! I just started my business. - What are we going to do? What am I going to do?! I can't use the insurance because I drank alcohol. Fuck me! - The repair will cost me 300,000. - 300,000? I can't dream of becoming a company president anymore No way! That's because you drank beer there. No, it's because you caused trouble for me. - Stand up! Stand up! - Whatever! I give up! Sister! Sister! How was it? I see. It didn't work. The guests said they wouldn't stay because there are no girls... and that this was a fraud. They all left. The girls were mean too. So, Hide didn't help you? If we don't do something, next week's tourists will also... What should we do? Iku, I heard everything. I guess you want some help from me. Don't worry. Don't worry. I have a great idea. I take care of you, you take care of me... Iku, if you are interested, I can do something. Iku! You take care of me, okay? Iku... It's been a week already. We have only one guest: Mr. Yamanobe. We can't run the ryokan like this, Sorry, Madam, It's all because my younger sister joined their crew. It must be hard for you too. Anyway, it's time to reduce costs. We might not be able to pay their wages soon, Tell everyone about this, I leave it to you. Okay? It's OK, right? Okay? We can't run the ryokan like this. I won't lose to you! If you are interested, I can do something. I can't use the insurance because I drank alcohol. The repair will cost me 300,000. I can't dream of becoming a company president anymore. You will become the wife of a company president. Hide... Iku... I've been waiting for this moment Iku... Iku... Lend... Mister! You can lend me 300,000 yen, can't you? Of course. I can lend you as much as you want. Okay, get undressed. Sit, Iku... Raise your head. Okay. I will introduce a lot of young Tokyo girls to you. Hide... Hide... - Here, 300,000! - Huh? Can I really use this to repair my car? Of course! That's why I am giving it to you! I feel so sorry. So, 1,300,000 in total? There is no one else I can rely on when I'm in trouble Thanks. I can't give you a penny from now on. I know. You are trying to gradually buy me like that, aren't you? See you. Hide, wait! Iku! Iku! I see, you did this for his truck... but you shouldn't be wandering here. The recovery of the onsen rests on your shoulders. I mean Tokyo. Tokyo! Several Days Later Welcome back! - I'm back. - Sister! Welcome back! - How was it? - Only young ones? But they are good. Madam! What are you going to do with those young girls? We don't have a place for them to stay. It's okay. We just let them stay in the restaurant and the cafe. I don't like it. Please come here, everyone - Yes. - Let's go. - Let's go! - Where are we going? Let's go! Would you come to our side? Really? Sister... No... I'm getting aroused. You guys are incredible! What you said was true, right? Yes. Of course! You guys are incredible. Would you like to spend the night? Thank you for coming. We are from the Ocean Observation Tower ryokan. If you want to keep enjoying yourselves, it's not late at all... Please come to the Ocean Observation Tower! Tonight, we are showing you our proprietary Deep Sea Underwater Bath. Let's start! How does it work? Crab walk and a boat? Huh? Huh? Finally, we are alone. But I am embarrassed... Don't be. I guess the story is about a president and his secretary. This will be a good story for my weekly column. It's beautiful. It's like a figurine. I won't be able to get married if you do that. Nobody cares about such things nowadays. It's beautiful. Did they have to describe this much? No, this is my idea. This gives their desires a form and a shape. It shows the affection of... Whatever, get out of the way! Hidden Paradise: Missionary Sex in Public Nanki Onsen Town This must be fake news! But I heard it directly from Mr.Yamanobe. But I didn't know Iku would do such a thing. You can only find out if a woman is good by actually doing it, right? So, how is Iku? Shut up! Hide, why don't you come to me then? Miss, what is the number for the Ocean Observation Tower? 5836, What's up, Hide? Is it true that you've slept with a guest? Mr.Yamanobe? He wrote about it in a weekly magazine. Is it true? Hide... Hide! Please forgive me! I was totally lost at the time. I didn't know what to do. The girls were stolen, The number of guests kept going down. I just wanted to give you the money to repair your truck. Did you want me to use this money like an idiot? Just use it for whatever you want! Okay, let's sell my truck and leave this town. Let's go to Osaka, We can do something in Osaka because of the Expo there We can earn money, Let's go. What are you going to do with your transport company? I can earn money here as the leader of a ryokan... because this is my hometown. It's not about that. I just want you to leave this town. You became weird because you live here. - You shouldn't live here. - Why? I don't need you to fuck other guys to help me run my transport company, - Are you kidding me? - Hide! What is he saying? Half of the car is mine! Thank you very much for boarding today. Welcome! Hey, Everyone has been waiting for your release Is Akutsu important? He is the top guy at Kanto Shoryukai. That means he's more important than Sabu, I guess. He was released from prison two days ago, He's a veteran. I see. Sabu! Kanto Shoryukai is different from other poor clans. I have to compliment you, but I have to finish things first. Of course. I will serve you properly starting tomorrow. Sabu, is there a place where I can enjoy a good view around here? I guess there is one at the beach. - What about it? - Great. Let's collect all the horny guys and have a orgy there. Of course, we have to collect an expensive admission fee. Let's do it! Start preparing for the event! Nevermind ordinary guys. The more important the guests are, the more secretive they are So call the event a "Study of Tropical Plants? Immediately! Brother! There is a woman disturbing us! Not now! Please enjoy your time tonight, What great girls! You have good taste. I am Mimi. I am very impressed! I guess you are into Sabu... but you are such a good girl. I like broad chests, Perfect Let me become your girl. Do you think Sabu is okay with it? Younger brother should follow older brother, right? You are very good at this, You are more important than Sabu. Welcome, mister. There is an old saying about one's hometown always being far away. But I am very touched by many onsen towns like this one. Also, the reclamation work for the bay area is on the way to completion. I am sure this town will become the best tourist town in Japan soon, I didn't know that a big businessman in West Japan... like you was from this area. So, how long are you going to stay here? Unfortunately, I have to finish my schedule. I wanted to buy a vacation home here several years ago, But I couldn't find time for it. I am planning to come here to rest sometimes from now on. Nice Shot! Hey, you're good! I'm impressed that a guy who was in prison until yesterday could play like that That's nothing. I heard that you helped them a lot while I was absent. Don't say that Your late boss used to help me a lot too. I'm just paying my debts. By the way, I told the Hong Kong side about the deal. Really? They were not easy to deal with. Because of you, I have hope for Kanto Shoryukai. Thank you very much. Akutsu... I discussed the new Hong Kong route as per your request... but I don't know anything about it. Got it. Much obliged. There is always someone better than you. Akutsu looks like a kid to me now. Of course. Wait! Are you... Is he jealous now? Nice Swing! Sabu! Are you genuinely interested in Mimi? Maybe! The fish you can't catch are the biggest, Nice Swing! - Sabu! - Yes! Thanks. There is someone causing trouble in this town. Sorry if they disturb you. - Don't worry about it. - Got it. By the way, please try this one. I can't because I don't know anything about it. The prostitution club we are running in the vacation home is doing well. Also, I am glad that we have the funds for the Hong Kong route now. The ship for Osaka will depart soon... All women are the same. Sorry! You got annoyed, didn't you? I hesitated to run away a little. Hey, your ticket Iku! Why don't you follow him? He said he'd get a job at the Expo. You can at least visit him. Miss! Can I rent this room? I want to keep it as it is. Of course, so long as I can earn money. I can help you like that. Hey, Iku! What's up? You look upset You've been cold towards me recently... so your younger sister is hanging out with me. Mr. Yamanobe thinks I taste better than you. I'll be featured in a gravure magazine. Nude photos. Nude! Michiko... He is a person who earns money by writing bad things about people. Better be careful. Our battle is going great A big businessman from Shoryukai joined our gang. We might take over your Ocean Observation Tower! Sister! Thank you for the present for Hiroko! Bye! Sister! Kei! I'm sorry for calling you all of a sudden, We've been just too busy to say hello lately. It's okay. You look very happy today. Well, we are having a orgy tomorrow. We got a special bonus for that An orgy? I'm not supposed to tell you. They gave me money to keep silent. Sister, keep it a secret! Welcome, Welcome, - Did the party start already? - Yes, just now. Please, come on in. Welcome, - It's going great - Yes! You said the rich are shameless and I think you're right. If we keep doing business this way, the onsen town will become rich too. Yes! President! Truly entertaining! I would call this a beastly orgy! Truly pleasant! You won't go in? We still have to wait for other guests. Please enjoy your time. Wow, President! This is great! Yamaguchi? How is it? Yes! It's time to go in! There's Akutsu! Great! Everyone, 90 in! Yes! - President, the cops! - What? - Matsura! - Huh? You are the host for this party! Matsura!

Please! Please! Brother! We prepared everything in secret. How did they find out? Some girls must have leaked it! Brother! The girls from the Ocean Observation Tower are washing their private parts without noticing anything, They do stuff according to the timetable, so let's wait. Good. The New Naples people must have already been arrested. It feels great! Sister! You look lonely. Are you thinking about Hideo? Yuki... We got the New Naples people arrested. - Madam was happy too, wasn't she? - Yeah! By the way, are they really totally naked? No! What are you doing? What did I do? You told your older sister about the orgy. Someone saw you talking to her in town. Are you kidding me? Brother! Mimi is not the sort of woman who snitches. They say that blood is thicker than water. The bond between sisters was stronger than her companionship, Right? Do it. No! I didn't tell anyone! No! No! Stop! I really don't know! No! No! It's hot! It's hot! No! Stop! Akutsu! I'm your girl! Why don't you believe me? Believe you? Don't make me laugh! You should stop pretending to be my mistress. Shit! I've served you loyally! You earned a lot using my body! I know what you really are! You're evil! No! No! Stop! Sabu! You do it. Yes, sir, - Mr. Aizawa is hereto see you. - Got it. Sell her to Hong Kong once she wakes up. Hello, mister. Akutsu, are these the Berettas that were made in Italy? This is our first business using the Hong Kong route. The customs checks have become very strict at Kobe and Yokohama. I think we can sell at a high price, Thank you for your service. By the way, Akutsu, the orgy stood out too much! I heard the Prefectural Police is taking action, You should be careful. There was a mistake during preparation. However, I will never disturb you in any way. You already had trouble with the Tokyo Police before. I don't want my vacation home raided by backwoods cops. Obviously. Sabu... Sabu... - Mimi! - Sabu! Be strong now, Mimi! I told you he wouldn't keep you around forever. But I really didn't tell my older sister anything! I know! But nobody believed you! They are having a party upstairs with Mr. Aizawa. Run away now! Come! Sabu, why are you doing this for me? I don't know either. Hurry up and get changed! I think Hiroko is going to look like you. Maybe... Stop it! We don't have time for talk! Hurry! Brother! Brother! - Mimi! Mimi is running away! - But... - Don't come close! I'll shoot! - Brother Sabu! Sabu! Mimi! - You idiot! Run! - No! Mimi! Mimi! Mimi! They got shut down because of the Prostitution Act. They ran a prostitution business at night. No choice, Wait. We need to talk! Wait! Idiot! The New Naples people must have done this! Shut down? We are the victims! I told you before. Prostitution is the problem. I have no time to talk about it! We got shutdown! Madam, what about our mortgage? I know! It's all Ikuyo's fault! Don't say that! Madam! Think about Yuki and the other too! I already told the property owner to sell the property. Ikuyo... Everything is your fault! Take responsibility! Madam... What's with that look? Do you remember when you came to me with Michiko? Have you forgotten who made you a proper woman? You two sisters gave me a disaster in return, You're lower than animals! Madam... That's too much! I've tried hard, even for my younger sister's share! I've earned a lot of money for the ryokan too! Who asked you to do that? You came here with your stupid younger sister voluntarily! I don't want to see your face anymore! Get out! I told you to get out of here! - That's too much... - Stop talking! Hanae! Bring Ikuyo's belongings! I see. I've served you until now. You think your ryokan is more important? You should've shutdown this miserable ryokan ages ago! I did my best for you! I even served disgusting guys to achieve it! Didn't I? The Ocean Observation Tower is mine too! Don't be ridiculous! I dare you to say that again! Stop! Bitch! I created this business! Don't you ever forget! I've served you until now! What now? I was the one who earned all the money! What is this? Everyone is just ridiculous! Michiko... Sister! I see. I reported the orgy to the police. It doesn't matter anymore, But a guy died because of me. Poor thing. Both of us have been abandoned, We have been mean to each other for nothing. I'm sorry, It's not your fault. Michiko, are you going to do something again? I am. I'll have my revenge. People are nothing but animals chasing their desires and money. I will make Hiroko the best mistress in Japan. I won't lose! We will sell our bodies together! Michiko... Sister... Let's do it together! Back to back. Together? That reminds me of our childhood, Let's sell our bodies together! We'll earn a lot of money from horny guys. Let's start the best ryokan in Japan! In a huge building! - Let's sell ourselves together! - The three of us! No! Sister! Where did she go? Everyone! Mimi has a weapon! Be careful! Hey! Let's search there! They left Where did you get that? A keepsake from my boyfriend. It's still new. Sister! We can earn money with this! - Earn money? - Yes. Mr. Aizawa, long time no see. Huh? Mister, can you give me 100 million? 100 million? That's too much for your allowance, Don't try to trick me. I know you have a lot of these in your vacation home's basement. You must be Mimi. - Stop this silly joke. - Don't underestimate me! I also know what you did in Hong Kong last month! If these dark secrets are revealed, you won't be happy. I see. I should be careful around you. But Mimi, you don't have any evidence of me smuggling guns through Kanto Shoryukai. Even if you took this to the police or weekly magazines... they wouldn't take you seriously, - It ends there. - Huh? I'm Mimi's older sister. You've just generated evidence for something that you say didn't happen. I think you got too old for this shit. But Mimi, you don't have any evidence of me smuggling guns through Kanto Shoryukai, Even if you took this to the police or weekly magazines... they wouldn't take you seriously. Fine, I got it. I will do the transaction at my vacation home. 100 million, right? Michiko, we can give up now. What should we do? It's okay, sister. They want this. - Hold on to it. - Okay. Be careful. Bye. Akutsu, this is serious! Those bitches are controlling us! If the gun transaction was revealed... it would affect my social reputation. Yes, I'm sorry, It is true that we made a mistake, but there is a solution. I knew you would find a solution. I will leave it to you. Please don't worry. Brother! I guess everyone is here. - Let's make the transaction. - Mimi... I'm glad you came. Would you hand over that dangerous thing? Only if I get Mr. Aizawa's allowance... Mimi... Stop playing childish games! Hey! Show her! Hey, get out - No! - Hiroko! Hiroko! Sorry! They forced me. It was inevitable, - Shit! You pulled a dirty trick! - Shut up! You blackmailed him. Give me the tape. If you give me Hiroko... Okay... Put the baby down! Hiroko! The baby... - Hiroko! - Mimi... Watch... Wait! - I will give you the tape. - Shut up! Please! I don't have the tape on me! I will give it to you if you give me the baby. Shut up! Ayami! - Kill it! - Wait! - Hiroko! - Shut up! Sister! Sister! Hiroko! Sister! Sister! Sister! I see.
