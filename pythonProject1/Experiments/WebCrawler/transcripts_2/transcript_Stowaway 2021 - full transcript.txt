Think it's open? I don't know. Oh. What? Yo! Hey! Hey, hey! Are you... The key! See ya later. Let's go. She took all of it. Let's go. Get in the car. Get in the car. Get in the car. Start the car! That was awesome. Oh, shit. Turn to your side. Other side. Face the front. Lower the sign. State your name. Bella Denton. - Place of birth. - Melbourne. Australia. You know, where they used to send the criminals. Is there anyone who can sign for you? Parents? Oh! Must have left them on my other jacket. Are they not around? Mom died. Your father. Where can we find him? Motor vehicle theft. Driving without a license. Petty larceny. And resisting arrest. Quite the night, Bella. Well, you know, if you're gonna do something, do it properly. You're probably looking at 36 months. You know that? So... Is there anyone, anyone at all... that we can call? No. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Here we go. Bella. Bella Denton. Yeah, I don't have money. Bella, my name is Ed Meeser. I've been looking for you for a long time. Well, there's no good way to say this, Bella, so I'm just gonna rip the Band-Aid off. Your father's passed away. You must be devastated. Yeah, I'll be fine. Just, uh, do me a favor and lose this number, okay? Bella, he left you something. What, besides a bad case of PTSD and some abandonment issues? That's so generous of him. A boat, Bella. He left you a boat. Whew! And I fucking hate boats. You won't hate this one. I promise. Dude. Who are you again? My name is Ed Meeser, and I was your dad's best friend, his business partner. He never mentioned me? Uh... let me think. Yeah. No. The last time my dad and I spoke, the topic was "My Little Pony," Pinkie Pie. So, no, you didn't come up. What the fuck am I going to do with a boat? I don't know. You can sail around the world. You can sell it. I just need you to come here and get this damn boat out of my hair, okay? I don't know. Where's "here"? Gulfport, Mississippi. Well, I still don't have any money. Yeah. I'm gonna arrange it for you. Alright. - Bella. - Hi. Ed Meeser, right? - Yes. So good to see you. - Yeah, you too. And by the way, thank you for all this. Of course. Yeah, was it... Was it okay? Yeah, it was actually really nice. Yeah? Well, I'm sorry it's under such terrible circumstances. Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. So, uh, which one of these bad boys is mine? Ah. There it is. Wait, the red one? That's kind of cool. No, Bella. It's the one next to the red one. It's the one that says your name on it. The Bella. - Very funny. Is that a joke? - No. It's not a joke. Your father loved you very much. I keep telling you that. Yeah, right. So how'd you know my dad, anyway? You guys hang out, fish, hang out on a giant yacht that I didn't know about? Come on. Walk with me. No, we, uh... we were in the military together. He didn't... He didn't mention that? We, uh... He... He, uh... He helped me transition back into civilian life when I got out. - Military. Huh. That's new information. So what did you transition? You're obviously doing very well for yourself. Well, I... A little of this, a little of that, and mostly consulting. Did he ever mention Arcana? Is that a "My Little Pony"? No, Bella. I... I'm just kind of in shock because, you know, your dad, he spoke about you all the time. Yeah, he mentioned that on the phone a lot of times. Thing is, haven't spoken to him in 20 years, so, unusual. Right. Wow. Alright. Uh, we just have to take care of one little thing before we can get... Get on the yacht. And you have your passport? Yeah. Yeah. - Gabriel. - You again? Told you I'd find her. You owe me 100 bucks. - $100? - You owe me 100 bucks. - We said $20. - No, we said $100. $20. I'm not betting with you anymore. Let me see if this is legit. Good? I got to say, man, this looks fake. Oh, come on. It's not fake. It's Australian. Do you know every country has their own passport? It's wild, isn't it? That's crazy, right? You see? It's Australian. Get out of here, man. You owe me 80 bucks. What was that about? There was a little miscommunication when your father passed, and the government impounded the boat, but it is back in the hands of its rightful owner. You. Congratulations. You have a boat. Right. I have a boat. And he really never told you the story about how I almost drowned on his watch and I actually kind of hate the ocean? - No, he didn't say that. - Well, you know. Are you afraid of water? Yeah. Yeah, I-I'm afraid of water. It's okay. A lot of people are afraid of the water. Alright, relax. I'm fine. I'm fine. You know what? I-I don't want this thing. You want to make me an offer? I hate boats. Bella, Bella, Bella, I can't afford the boat. It's your boat. I mean, come on. It's a beautiful boat. It's worth a lot of money. I can help you sell it if that's what you want. I promise you. Look, I-I understand you're probably wondering what the hell's going on. You're... You're... You're maybe mad at him and... and pissed off, and you don't want anything from him. But this is his way of showing you that... that... That he cares, that he loves you. It's his way of giving you something. Bella, take it. Fine. But I'm changing the name. - Change the name. - My Little Pony. My Little Pony. - I love it. My Little Pony. This is Captain Lawson. - Pleasure. - This is Bella. We're changing the name to My Little Pony. My Little Ponyit is. A pleasure. Nice meeting you. - Nobody knows the boat better than him. - You're in good hands. - Okay? - Alright. I'm gonna come get you tomorrow. We're gonna sign some papers and we'll take care of it. After you. I'm here if you need me, Bella. Relax. Alright. Keep her away from the water. You're gonna need a new shirt. - So you guys made a change. - Yeah. Here we have the top deck. Jacuzzi... We can fill it up at your discretion. - Seriously? - Yes. Down here, we have the bridge. By any chance, if you need me, my cabin is near the radio room in the lower deck. Okay, but do you live here or...? No, I have a house in town. Okay. Sorry, I didn't mean to sound rude. It's just I definitely can't afford to... Your father paid me to the end of the year. He was a great man. We were in the service together. Let me show you around. Impressive, right? - Yeah. Here's a salon, large room for entertaining. We have a wet bar, fully stocked. Half the stuff here hasn't even been used. I think there's even a sous vide somewhere. You cook? Can you sous vide Hot Pockets? - You can try. - Okay. The galley's ahead, and the master cabin is below. Follow me. Watch your step on the way down. Here is the master cabin. Are you kidding me? It's huge. Right? It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah. - It's all yours. This is mine, then? Alright. Make yourself at home. Ahh. I can see why people do this. Well, unfortunately, I can't finish the tour. I got to go. But, uh, did Ed check you into the hotel? - No, but I can just stay here. - Unfortunately, you can't. Until you sign the papers, we got to get the keys back. The law is very complicated. Sorry. You know your way around here? No, but I can figure something out. Okay. Can I get another? And, uh, send one down there too. It's on her. Keep the change. Oh, thanks, girl. - Thanks. - Pleasure. Just came into a whole lot of money. - Cheers. - Cheers. Ohh. Really? Oh, it doesn't get easier. And yeah, so I've always wanted to travel the world and as soon as I could, I packed my bags and never went back. Panama Canal. Machu Picchu twice. Uh, Gal√°pagos. And now good old Mississippi. Nice. Yeah, but it's not always beers on the beach with beautiful women. - Oh. No, that doesn't work. That doesn't work on girls. Does it really? It usually does. But I guess that means you're really special. Oh, my... You can't stop. You can't stop, can you? No. - What, that one didn't work? - No. - Well, that's my best material, so I'm done. I'm done. - Alright, bar's closed. - Oh, come on. - Gotta go. - Really? - Yes. That's 'cause of all that shit you were saying. She's like, "Got to get him out of here." Ahh. I might know a place we can go. - Really? - Yeah. If you drop the whole corny pick-up line thing. - Deal. - Deal. Let's do it. Holy shit. What? - Yeah. - You got a Jacuzzi? Apparently, I have a Jacuzzi. On a yacht. Your dad just left you this thing? Yup. And trust me when I say that that was the least that he could do. We were not close. At all. - I'm sorry. It is fine. Let me show you the rest. Down the stairs. Spiral stairs. Check this out. This... This is my room. Oh, my God. Bigger than anywhere I ever lived before. This is what we call... a master bedroom. That is... That's... It is that. This is a... a bathroom that has mirrors on the ceiling. Ceiling and the floor. Alright, are you done? Can I... What are you... Come on over, you pervert. Give me this. Give me my phone back. Alright. Oh, hi. - Oh, hey. - You gonna take that shirt off? Damn, you're pretty cute. Pick-up lines aside. Come here. Hey. Hey, what are you doing out here? No one's supposed to be out here. Turn around. I'm right where I'm supposed to be. Put your hands up. Hands up, slow. Put your fucking mask back on. Wake up. - Mm? Wake up. The... The boat's moving. Well, isn't this your boat? Why is it moving? Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. No, it's... it's... It's really moving. We got to get off this boat. Now. On three. - On three what? - We jump. - Fuck. No, I can't go overboard. I can't do that. Listen to me, I will help you, but we have to jump. - I-I don't swim. I can't swim. - Fuck. Alright. I'm gonna get us help. I promise. Okay? Stop the boat. Come on, come on. What the fuck? What the fuck? Come on, come on. Someone was on the boat. Find him. I got him. Ready. 9:00, 50 meters. To the left. More left. Come on, you can do it, you can do it. - Ah, fuck. - New strategy. By eye, go to the ladder. - No target. - Just wait. Come on, come on, come on. No target. God damn it, Sunshine. Be ready. Just be ready. - What's happening? - Shh. Shut up! Guys, what's happening? What's happening? Shut up. Target acquired. Are... Are you serious? Come on. Come on, come on. You can't shoot a gun here. Everybody's gonna hear it. Take the shot. Fuck. Fuck. Oh, this is not right. Shut the fuck up, Captain. Ohh. Took you long enough. Dad'd be pissed. What did you just say, soldier? - What? - Sorry, sir. You said nobody was gonna get hurt. Well, I wouldn't go in the living room if I was you. Start the fucking boat. Let's go. Let's go. - This is insane. - Move it. Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Shit, fuck. Oh, my God. Okay, Captain, let's take her out to sea. What if he wasn't alone? I'll take the upper deck. You take the lower. We need to talk. Now. Stay off this Goddamn frequency. The hell you gotten me into? You knew what you signed up for, who we are. Gabriel, this kid you shot with this fucking sniper rifle. You paid me to pilot the boat, not kill innocent people, man. What the hell is going on? - You're right. We paid you to pilot the boat, not to ask questions. This is not right. You know it's not, Let's make a deal. You do your job, you let me do mine. We both come out rich on the other side. Okay? Okay. What? Come on. Shit. What? Come on. Come on. Great fucking present, Dad. Come on. What the hell are you into, Dad? Alright, come on, come on, come on. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Radio. There's a radio. Get to the radio. Okay. - See anything? - Nothing. You handle the captain? - Yep. - He makes me nervous. - I'm not worried. Captain always goes down with the ship. Input the wrong code, the safe sends a GPS signal to the cops. But you can crack it? Code is decentralized. Pieces of it are on computers all over the world like Bit coin. I'll break it. The numbers are only one part. Four mechanical locks. Easy to get through, but it'll take time. And if we get through all those, we still have the biometric lock. We got that taken care of. Careful. Hey. What is it? Thought I heard something. Let's get our money. Bolts are down. Alright, let me get in here. Did it work? Let's see. Looks like it. You really think it's in there? $80 million. All $80? What the lieutenant says. Can we trust him? No. That's why we have guns. Fuck. Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello, anyone? Please. Coast Guard? This is the Coast Guard. What is the nature of your distress? I need help immediately. I'll check. I need a rescue now. Identification? - My what? - Ship identification. - I have no idea. - What is your position? Uh... Position, position. Somewhere in the fucking middle of the ocean. Push the red button. DSC. Did you find the button? Shit. There's someone on the boat. They're in the engine room. Coast Guard on the way. Shit. Did anyone run by? Did you see anyone? - No. - Did you call the Coast Guard? - No. Why would I... - Did someone run by? No. No, no one ran by. Hey. We're finally getting somewhere. We have a stowaway. We should run. Guys, they're locked onto our GPS. If we run, they'll catch us. Safe's not open. We stay. I still say we run. We knew this was a possibility, and we planned for it. Let's execute that plan. Guys, this will never work. I'm telling you. You gonna rat us out to the Coast Guard? No, no. I never said that. You think Heather would like that idea? I don't think she would. - How do you know my wife? - How about Anna? I think she'd fucking hate that idea. Get back to the bridge, Captain. Find them before they get here. Fuck. Psst. What are you doing here? Please help me. Alright, let me think. There's an inflatable boat in the last rivet. It's in the lower deck. Launch it at the back of the ship. Lawson. Lawson. Fuck. Run. Yeah? Yeah? Don't you have a ship to steer? Yeah. Did you see him? - No. - The stowaway. I-I didn't see. Let's go. Here I come. Ready or not. Come out, come out wherever you are. We have a Coast Guard problem. Okay. What happens if the stowaway shows up? We kill everyone. What? Prepare to be boarded. Where's the captain? Take me to him. Welcome aboard. - You the captain? - Yeah. And do you know why we're here? No, sir, I don't. We received a distress call. Do we look distressed? Any women on board? No. Little late for a joyride, isn't it? Well, sure you got the right boat? Hey, Captain. Look what I found. What's this? Halloween leftover. Looks like a disguise to me. You know, this close to Mexico, we get a lot of trafficking... Drugs, people. Women mostly, but, uh, there's no women on board, are there? No. How about we take a look? - Right this way. - Search the ship. Hey. Hey. How long is this gonna take? Excuse me? Seems like a waste of time, no? You guys should be done by now. Come in, over. Vessel in distress 13 miles from your location. I'll get the captain. I'll go get him. It's off limits. Take your hand off me. - It's the owner's quarters. - Step aside. - Not even the crew has... - Step aside now. Or there's gonna be a problem. Okay. Captain. Captain. The crew needs you. It's urgent. Distress call came in. Crew says she's taking on water. - How far? - 13 miles. Muster the crew, double time. You find anything? - Nothing. Have a good night, gentlemen. Hey! Look at that, Captain. Nobody died. Let's get to work. We'll deal with that stowaway later. Show time. You have the recorder? Ready? Arthur Denton. What the fuck is that? I don't know. He said it will be there. $80 million in fucking gold. What the fuck is this? I'll call him. That son of a bitch. He fucked this whole thing up. Hey! Calm down. Job's not done. Set up the C-4 in the engine room. What about the stowaway? Find him. Kill him. We have a problem. Get me off this fucking barge. I'll go set up the raft. Okay. Why are you doing this, anyway? I need the money. I meant helping me. Your dad did a lot for me and my family. There's something important I got to get from the bridge. Sit tight. It'll only take a minute, okay? Yeah. Sure. It's not like anyone's trying to kill me or anything. Jesus Christ. Oh, God. Jim, is that you? Hey, girly girl. I'm not gonna hurt you. Where'd you learn to fight like that? Cell Block H. Let's go. What is this? You're his girl? Artie's kid? Jesus, this just got a whole lot sweeter. See, Lawson? This is the kid. Look him right in the fucking eye. Watch that light go out. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. Oh, my God. Sunshine. Sunshine. Sunshine, come in. Sunshine, report back. I heard a shot. I'm coming to you. Bella, get down. Get down. Stay down. I'll get us out of here. Stay down. Stay down. Oh! Stay down. Fuck. I think we're okay. New problem. - Hey, you alright? You okay? - Yeah. - Hey. - Ow. I think the fuel's out. We should wait till daylight. Probably just rest till then. I'm gonna take the gun, okay? Yeah. Busy night, huh? Oh, God. Look. That's Anna. She's 12. She's really beautiful. She's sick. Doctors don't know what it is. And the test was so expensive. She's why you did all this. Bella, she's everything. Your father was helping us pay for the treatments. He was a good man. So you keep telling me. Hey, have you, uh, you ever heard of companies like Blackwater, Titan, Arcana? W-What is this? Civilian contractors in destabilized war zones like Syria and Afghanistan. Your father owned Arcana. He had contracts in Kabul. Things he had to do, the shit he'd seen, Bella, it ate him up. Some of his mercenaries killed off a warlord in Afghan. Killed his wife, killed their kids, took $80 million. $80 million. Your father stole it back and went on the run. And get this... He gave it all away. To people who needed saving. Like my Anna. Like you. I had no idea. Oh, Bella... He was a good man, Bella. He was so proud of you. Hey, when you graduated college, my God. Bennington, right? Yeah. He said, you, uh... He used to tell me me you cut off the sleeves of your gown to show off some of your ink. I always got a kick out of that. Thought it was badass. I, uh... I didn't even know that he was there. He loved you. Even from the shadows. Someone's coming. Hey! - Hey, we don't know who that is. Why, what does it matter? You need help. Jesus Christ, at least... At least hide the gun. Over here! We need help! They're coming. They're coming. Ohh, I don't know if I'm gonna make it. Yes, you are. Ohh. Ed, thank God you're here. You okay? You won't believe what happened on the boat. You alright? I always knew you were gonna kill me. - I want to kill her. - Don't kill her yet. Ohh, Bella, Bella, Bella. Alright, come up here. Oh, I think I might have... Oh, easy, easy. Come on, come on, Bella. I think I got a little rambunctious. I didn't mean to hit you so hard there, Bella. You okay? Ah, don't touch it. Don't touch it. Because my mother used to say if you touch it, it doesn't heal. Bella. Bella, Bella, Bella, Bella, Bella. Where did it go wrong? - Mm? - When you stole my fucking boat. I love this kid. Your boat. Bella, the only reason why you got the boat is 'cause your backstabbing piece of shit father stole my money. It's supposed to be in that safe, Bella. 80 million fucking dollars. Know what I found? I found this. This necklace. I mean, it's nice, but I don't think it's worth $80 million. Do you? I want to kill her. Jim, I'm talking. So now what? Plan is fucking ruined. We were gonna blow the boat up, get rid of the evidence. Can't do that now. What do I do? Sell it on the black market? Maybe get 10 cents on the dollar? I mean, that's a big pain in my ass, Bella. Or you can tell me where the money is. Hmm? Tell me where the money is. Where's the money? Where's the money? 80 million bucks. We'll split it three ways. Come on. Your friend's on a different page. He just said he was gonna kill me. Oh, he's not gonna kill you. This is what I'm talking about. Leverage, right? This is negotiating 101. I keep telling you, man, you got to relax. Easy with the steroids. Hey. Hey. He's not gonna kill you. Where's the money? You're a fucking monster. I'm not. I'm just a product of your father because he told me everything that I know 'cause we were partners, Bella. You're nothing like my dad. He helped people. He was a thief with no honor. Bella, your father was a thief with no honor. I loved him like a brother. He stole my fucking money. My money. Not his and not your fucking money. Bella. I mean, what were you fucking thinking? All you had to do was wake up in your hotel room and say, "Oh, my God, my boat. It's gone. Has anyone seen my boat?" 10 million bucks, insurance, on your way. 10 million bucks you would have got. Would have been fine. But no. Here we are. Best thing is to hope for an easy and painless death. Unlike your father. You said he fucking drowned. Whoa. Bella. Bella, Bella, Bella, easy. You said he drowned. Maybe he drowned. Maybe. I mean, he did beg for his life. He begged for your life, too, and I said I wouldn't hurt you. Now you made a fucking liar out of me, Bella. So. Either you tell me where the money is. Or... Or I'm gonna let Jim here do exactly what he said he's gonna do to you with that drill. I want to drill her eye out. He wants to drill your eye out, apparently. Pretty eyes. When you took my gun, did you take my notebook? Was there a notebook? Was there a notebook?! See, now we're getting somewhere, Bella. Now we're getting somewhere. Isn't this better? It's the last page. Columns. Numbers. Tell me, Ed. What does that last number say? Zero. He gave it all away. You get nothing. You get fucking nothing! $80 million, gone? First I'm gonna kill her, then I'm going to kill you. - Hey, Jim. - Shit. You got to stop telling people you're gonna kill them. Ahh. Bella! Bella! Hey, Bella. Bella. Come on, Bella. There's nowhere to go. I wish this would have ended differently. It's over. You're not gonna jump. You're not gonna do it. You're afraid. You're afraid of the water. You're not gonna jump. Bella. You're not gonna do it. Be... Fuck. Bella. Bella, wake up. Wake up, Bella. Wake up, Bella. I've got you. It's okay, Bella. I've got you. I've got you, Bella. We got her! You okay? Yeah, uh... How did you know...? We got a call from some Michael in the hospital. Sounded real worried. He said he would get help. I didn't think we were gonna get back here in time. Looks like you can handle yourself okay. Let's get you home. Sure you want to do this? I mean, I can think of a lot more things to do with $10.2 million in insurance... I'm sure. I'm sure. Alright. Alright, well... Where to next? No idea. Wait. You ever been to Machu Picchu? Let's go. Come on. Anna? Are you expecting something? No, Mom. Come on. Oh, and I didn't give all the money away. I'm not an idiot.
