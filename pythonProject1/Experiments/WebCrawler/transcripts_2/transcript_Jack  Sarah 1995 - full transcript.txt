OK, that's the baby's face, nose there. and there's the mouth, lips, and there is... Oh there there's the baby yawning there, there you can see the mouth open now, Ah! it's lovely. It's just shut its mouth now. OK! You've taken the roof off? Yeah. What if it rains? It won't. I see. It's a 100 short! Phone Jack! Oh right, thanks! Right! Good. Well, keep up the good work. Bye. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two... And the contractions gone, and sigh. You're supposed to count my breathing. You're supposed to breathe in when I count. This is never gonna work. Alright, let's have another go at pushing, and remember, right down through your bottom. Men as well. That's right, splendid! Good! Oh come on Jack! There's really no need to be embarrassed. Good! That's it! Think pain and then push down pushing the pain away. Pushing the pain away. Pushing the pain away. Don't forget to breathe. One, two, three. What's wrong? Are you alright? No one told me it would be like this. What's the matter with you? It would appear that he's in labor. Please help me! Epidural! That's it I think. Oh no! I'm sorry. Do you want nipple pads and nipple shields, or just the pads? Bastard. OK, I'll get both. Flesh colored or white? If your father goes on this way we are going to end up in a single-parent family! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I still don't see what you're getting at. All I'm saying is if you'd like some time off around the 22nd, a couple of days there will be good for us. But she's not due until the 25th Anna. Fine! I'm only saying things will be more manageable around the 22nd. Alright. Sure. I'll ask Sarah to check her diary and see if she can bring the birth forward. Good. That's it then. Don't forget the partners dinner on the third of next month, as discussed wives are not invited. I'll be around Eddie, just a minute! Don't sound so amazed! That's it! You've known for weeks. Yeah but it's only three days away! This is our third attempt to move into this house and this time, this time you're not going to stop us. We can work the weekend. We will need extra men of course. Good, don't expect me to pay for them. You already have mate, several times over. Right... one, two, three. That told them. Certainly did darling. It's just a question of being firm. Gain their respect. Come on, let's go. Letting them know who's in charge and not letting them get away with it. Mind you having said that, I sometimes think that it would be easier for them if we just didn't move in at all. Come on, it's freezing. Can you spare the price of a cup of tea? Get out of my skip! I was here first! Get out of my skip! Possession is nine tenths of the law. Good night. Sarah... This is where it all begins darling. This is where it all begins. I thought you said Monday week. You know what I said, and here we are. We're moving in and you're moving out. Hello. Hi Sarah. Oh hi. So we're going tonight, OK? Tonight? Are we not finished? Well you'll just have to come back, won't you. No, I'm not, honestly. You can tell me. I was I'll tell you if I wasn't. It'll only take a couple more days. Tough. OK... see you later. Tell me it's not true. It's not true. I want you out... now! Jack, have you invited Rob and Lizzie round tonight? No. So why do they think they're coming to dinner with Nick and Anne and Pamela? Gosh, all our friends! Jack! I don't know. Oh yes I do. She's wrong it's next week, they're coming a week after we move in. We should have moved in last week. It's not fair. I'll cook. Just look at me, I'm just one big swelling... I look disgusting. Sarah... And you know very well that I'll end up doing it all and you'll end up getting pissed and boring and everyone's stupid so we won't see them again for six months. Sweetheart, I'll cook. Baby's got hiccups. Oh no. It's going to be a drunk just like its father. Do you know what I think, that Pamela has got a crush on you. Of course she has, she's your sister. Runs in the family. Will you turn off the light. Jack! Jack! I want you to stay calm, but could you take me to the hospital please? The hospital? Right. The hospital? Yes. What's wrong? Are you ill? The baby's coming. The baby is coming! What? Now? The baby's coming now? Are you contracting? Every six minutes. Oh Jesus! Jesus! Just stay calm! Have you packed the bag? No. Oh! Jack! I'll do it now. What are you doing? I don't know. Stop panicking. I'm not panicking. I've rehearsed this for months. I'm in complete control. Just pack the bag and call a taxi. Right. OK! One, two three. One, two three. One, two three. One, two three. Jack? Jack! Are you alright? Yeah. Having another one? Just going. Good. Oh I hope he doesn't miss it. He'll never forgive himself, God help him. What is it? What's wrong? Mama...? Oh Jack... Oh Jack! My girl. My little girl. I have to go. Of course. We're having a dishwasher delivered. Jack. It's a girl, Jack... little girl. I'm late. Where do you want this mate? Anywhere. Fair enough. Cheer up, it may never 'appen. You should go and look after your ma. Yes. There's a load of stuff on the corner, could you take it? Won't you...? Of course I will. Hello, this is Sarah. I'm afraid neither Jack nor I can answer at the moment, but please leave a message and we'll call you back as soon as possible. Bye. Leave a message after... Guys, this is Rob... thank you for last night, and Jack don't forget to join in... Thank you. Sarge. Miss. How long have you been back? Look. I'm sorry I had to call you, but I did. I wouldn't have if I had any choice but I didn't, so I'm sorry. Jack! People have been worried sick. You can't just fuck up for weeks and not tell anyone. It's not fair. Could you pull over? I don't have any money. I'll be fine here. Come William. Jack! I am forever indebted. If ever the opportunity should arise when I could repay... William! Jack! Shit! Move William. I was here first. William! Why! Is the great psychiatrist doing a house call how wonderful. Do come in. Drink? Is that an offer or a challenge? Straight into it! Excellent! Do you mind if I tape this conversation and then maybe I can decifer it when you're gone? I haven't got long. Why does that have such a familiar ring? You need help Jack. You're traumatized. Bullshit... I'm pissed. I can't begin to imagine what you're going through! Don't even try. Alright. What about the baby? What about it? She is your daughter. You've never been too good very good at facing up to your responsibilities... and maybe now? Here we go. You're such a pompous asshole! People pay me a great deal of money to listen to what I have to say. People pay you money for you to listen dad. Forty years, and you still haven't learned. This is hopeless. I don't know why you bothered taking off in the first place? Oh don't worry, I'll tell mother that you really tried. You don't need to be so unpleasant, no matter what you've been through, before people stop caring Jack. Just remember that. I'll just go and have a look. Stay. Jesus! Mom! Mom! Oh! I get it, I get it... OK throw the ball at Jack and see if he drops it? It don't work if Jack don't play. This is 332-18-94. I'm sorry we can't get to the phone, so please leave a message after the tone. It's me. Pick up the phone! Come on. Pick it up! You know, if you'd wanted me to call, you just had to ring you know. You didn't have to go this far! Mom, this is stupid! Oh for God's sake! Mamma! Phil... call Phil. Oh please don't cry. Please. You're hungry? Hungry? Right then. That's better. You sure about this? Of course. you heard him, it's fine. What if he hurts her when he's drunk? He won't. Life goes on. She'll soon show him that. So they've all ganged up on daddy. Oh that's fine. It isn't so difficult after all. Come on. There you are! Piece of piss... Oh no. No, just stop. Stop! Taxi. Great. What's the matter? Oh... nothing, nothing at all. I'll be in the car. You'll freeze if you go out like this. It's clean, I promise. You look Fab. Yes! You do! You look Fab. That's the lot? It better be. You couldn't have bought anything else. Thanks. Doesn't she look gorgeous? Lovely. What's her name? Sarah. Her name's Sarah. 11 pounds and 6 ounces. That's alright, isn't it? Of course it is. It's a very good weight. You mean she's fat? I mean she's fine. She's normal, she's healthy, she's happy. Maybe I should change her milk. I'll call in again next week and then I won't need to see you again until your three month check. Fat indeed! Thank you. The decorator will be down and Rob's boys will finish tomorrow. Great. Uh... my missus has knitted that... Oh it's beautiful. And some other... Thank you. Thank you very much. Anyway, you've got my number. I certainly have. Bye. Bye. 11 - 6. Oh! 11 - 6.? Well I'm sure he'll tell you all about it. Are you on your way over there now? Yes. No. We thought we ought to let him get on with it. Find his feet. I see. So... is he putting her down on her back? Yes. but of course he is Phil... come on. And wrapping her up properly? Absolutely. Sarah is a very happy little baby. Well, I must be off. Bye. Phil... No, I'm fine... honestly. It's lovely. I just hadn't expected it, that's all. So... the rumor circulating the park is true the little princess has returned. My heartfelt congratulations and sincere felicitations, Jack. Thank you, William. You're looking well, better you know. Much better like this. Your place is looking good too. Yes, it's almost finished. Oh well... plenty of time. I... thought perhaps I might take the baby for a little walk just around the perimeter of the park. Oh William... that's just not possible. You know I can't let you do that! Look... here... take this... please. William! William! William! Ah shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Hm, what is it? You can't be hungry. OK, come on. Shall I do that? No, I'll be quicker. I think you're being a bit rough with her, mom. Oh nonsense. Babies are more resilient than you think. There we are. Where do you intend keeping her at the office? At the filing cabinet? That's a good idea. It isn't a joke, she's not a doll. I'd be very happy to have her Jack. Oh don't be silly Phil. You were a shambles as a mother. You said so yourself. Besides you've been through a lot lately dear, you're still grieving. No we'll have her. I don't want to leave her with anyone at the moment. Well we're hardly anyone. I have to cope on my own. He's right He isn't, he's got us! I want her at work with me if I can't, I'm not going back it's as simple as that, for now. Well when the novelty wears off, give us a call and see if we're free. Would you take the rest of her feed now? Here you are Phil, you do the honors. You needn't worry, I'm going to get a nanny. A nanny? A nanny? Going away? You'd be amazed how much prep one of these things needs. She's sweet. Sarah's eyes! Yeah. I don't want the whole place disrupted Jack. I know things are difficult for you, but unfortunately that holds no sway within these walls. This is a law firm not a nursery. You have an obligation to the other partners. You won't even know she's here, I promise. Hello. Oh isn't she gorgeous! Hello little girl! So let's get this absolutely correct. At 76 years of age, after 54 years of marriage, five children and twelve grand children, you want a divorce because you think it's time for a change! Have I got that right? She won't settle, I think she's overtired. She'll go off if you take her out in the car. I can't, and no one else is free. I know. Could I put you on hold? You turned this place into a crash. You're getting away with murder, and you know it. Oh Anna... No don't get me wrong, I don't mind. It's just interesting, that's all. It would never have happened if you've been a woman! Jack! How are you? Fine, fine. Very well in fact. Is it yours? Yes she is. How's Sarah? Is she here? Howard, can I have a word? Yes. I'm fucked up dad. Completely... fucked! Have you talked to anyone? No. Would you like me to fix something up? Caroline's very good. She might be helpful. No. I want to talk to you. Would that be alright... do you think? Hello. Hello. Isn't he beautiful, how old? She's 14 weeks. Is he yours? No, I stole her. OK, dumb question... what will it be? I'd like the hamburger, rare, with whatever comes with it. Anything to drink? Coffee, cappuccino. And what about gorgeous, anything for him? He's... she's fine, I brought her formula. Right, do you want me to heat it up? Oh that would be great, yes. She prefers it warm. Made it myself. I bet you did. One hamburger rare, one cappuccino, and one goo. Thanks. Alright. How's my favorite waitress then? Please don't. Oh! I'm sorry... What did you do that for? It was an accident. Yeah. Of course it was. Bring the gentleman another beer. Now. Here, let me do that... You should eat. Aren't you busy? Oh we'll get it over in ten minutes? Come on you. What's his name? John. His name's John. OK well let's go John. See you later. Look at those big blue eyes. Doesn't it just kill you? Getting broody Amy? If I was, you'll be the last to know. How are you doing? Great, that's just great, thank you very much. Sure. Here, I washed his bottle too. Thank you. He's a gorgeous baby. Yes I think so too. Anything else? Just the bill please. Right. Check for number three please. The couple at seven. They're not finished yet. Then where are they, Cherie? Shit! How much do I owe? That's 27 pounds and 50 pence not including service. Tell me Alain, did you see them leaving? Coffee for table four please. I'll pay the other bill as well. Why they're friends of yours? Why don't you just shut it and let me pay the bill. Certainly makes no difference to me. I'm sure it doesn't. Amy! Don't bother, I'm leaving! Now wait a minute, you can't fire her for that? I didn't, she resigned. But it was my fault. I'm sure it was. Excuse me. Stop! Wait! Wait a minute! Hey, what about the other bill? You were right, I didn't know them after all. You come very highly recommended, lovely references. My friend at the agency, Felicity, is full of praise. Yes, she likes to call me her 'no-nonsense' nanny. Does that mean you're quite strict with children? No. It means I'm extremely strict with parents. No, to be serious, of course, baby does need discipline. Her name's Sarah. What exactly do you mean by discipline Miss Cartwright? Routine. Give baby an inch and she'll take a mile. Her name's Sarah, and she's four months old. Never be fooled by baby's age Mr. Gasket. Very impressive. Phil? She was certainly efficient. She was awful. Well what was it you didn't like exactly? Oh come on mother. No! Explain to me. I don't know... It just doesn't feel right. I wouldn't be... Listen... I didn't want to upset you Phil. Just imagine what Sarah would think! Sarah walks through that door right now, and you say that Miss 'starch neck' is over there is going to look after your baby. You know what she'd say! Yes I'm afraid I do. She doesn't someone who's impressive mum, She needs someone who'll love her. I don't know why you wouldn't let us look after her. I cannot understand why you're being so obstinate. Is there someone else in the house? Yes, William. Who he? A friend. He comes and helps out now and then. Like you, thinks this is all very unnecessary. Can't see why he doesn't look after her himself. Come in. I just made some tea. Thanks. It'll need a couple of minutes in the pot. Excuse us. Where on earth did you get him from? A skip. Excuse me. Men's room is on the third floor. I don't want to use the toilet. I want to change her nappy. You can't go in there. Why not? because that's the ladies toilet, that's why not. It's also the changing room. Point of fact, it's the mothers' room. What exactly is the difference? It's for mothers. You're not a mother. Is this true? So where is the fathers' room? We haven't got one. Well, there you go. Excuse me.... Listen... it's not my fault that you only provide facilities for women to change their children and not men. I need to change my daughter's nappy, and I'm going to use the room provided. If you don't like it, build another room. Well, I just have to call the manager. Good, because if you don't, I will. God I hope there's no one in here. Hurry up, hurry up! That's the weirdest looking boy I've ever seen. Amy! Do you always use the ladies room? Yes... I mean no. I tried to catch up with you the other day. Don't worry. Well I did, I felt responsible. Don't! It wasn't so much a job as a punishment from hell. Must have done something really bad in a previous life. Are you working? What are you doing now? What's her name? Sarah. Um nothing. I'm doing nothing at all. Hello sweetie. I come in now. Just tell Anna I'm gonna have to bring Sarah in today. What's happened to the nanny? I don't know where the fuck she is. I'll see you in a bit. Hello? It's me. Has she rang yet? No she hasn't. I thought this might happen. Shall I come over? No, I have to get into work, I can't wait. Maybe tomorrow. Do I have to check my diary? You do that. Don't lose your temper Jack, whatever her excuse is, don't blow it. Hang on sweetie. Amy, you're late which means I'm late. I know, I know! I'm sorry. Took me longer to get my stuff together than I thought. Stuff! What stuff? What are you talking about? Wait a minute! Shit! It's alright darling, it's alright. There you go. Amy. What's going on? I know it seems like a lot but once in my room you'll never know it's here. Your room? What are you talking about?? My room. The place where I sleep. Sleep! No. This is a daily job. The ad clearly stated daily. I didn't see any ad, if I remember correctly, you offered it to me in the ladies room. You can't stay here, you just work here. I see... I thought... Oh that'll be work. Look I have to go, we'll sort this out later. Here, she needs a a change. A change? Yeah, her nappy. You've never changed a nappy before? You know, her thing... her diaper. Oh right, her diaper! Sure. Oh God! Oh no! I think perhaps I should call. You've only just arrived! Even so, she doesn't know where anything is. I didn't have time to show her the ropes. Just make sure she's settled in. It's engaged! Sounds like she's settled in to me. I know it's 4:30 in the morning mom but it's an emergency. No no, I'm fine. It's just that I need to know how to change a diaper. Mom... Mom... calm down. I haven't had a baby! I got a new job. I'm a nanny. What's so funny? Have this sent by courier bag, will you. Uh she's bound to get off the phone soon. What if she goes out, I wouldn't be able to get hold of her. Anything could happen. Just send it round. Thank you. I can't see anyone. She's probably taken the baby out for a walk. Don't be so neurotic. Why didn't you tell her I was going round? I didn't know you were going to go round to spy on her, did I? Then what should we do? We? A complete stranger is roaming the streets of London with your child, and you're going to do nothing? Well on your head be it! She could be anywhere! I hate to be the one to tell you this, but baby girl's just ringing. Oh God! Could you pass it over? Thanks. Hello? You're not at home! Correct. Fine. That's OK. That's good. Was there any particular purpose to this call? yes. Yes I want you to bring her into work. What? Now? Yes. But I thought the whole point of having me was that you didn't have to take her to work. You're right. Of course you're right. Put her on will you? What? The baby. Put her next to the phone, I want to speak to her. OK... OK! Alright? Why is she breathing so heavily? She's excited. She's never been on the phone before. Where exactly are you? In a cafe on upper street with my friend Susan. Does she smoke? No! She doesn't smoke. I don't want her surrounded by smoke. Well that's very sweet of you, but she's 26 and quite capable of looking after herself. I'm talking about Sa... Look, I know who you're talking about Relax, I mean she's... She cut me off. She cut me off. You cut him off! It's the fifth call since lunch. She is his baby! Don't worry, he'll think we went under a bridge. In a restaurant? I think you'll find that's the wrong way around. Oh! Yes. So it is. Thank you Bill. Would you mind passing me those pants? Pants? No, I think she would like to wear a dress today. OK. Right... well. It's time madam had a little nap. She's very tired She's not tired dear, she's bored! She needs entertaining. Fine. Well would you mind entertaining her while I do the laundry? It's done. Right. Thanks. I'll just get started with her lunch then. Hi. Sorry we're late with the shopping. Good. We're out of coffee. Oh no no no. Baby shopping. Got her some stuff for summer. Really cute. We had fun. Isn't it just adorable? And I got a hat, see, matches. She looks beautiful in it. Listen, there wasn't enough in the pot, so you owe me. Oh! No problem. How much? 260. 2... 60... A hundred... Two hundred and sixty. What? Two hundred and sixty pounds? I know, I know. I could hardly believe it myself. Seven little outfits, and bits and pieces, well I had them checked and there it was, sure enough 260 be cheaper in the States. It'll be cheaper to go to the States. I gotta go. I'm going out. You did say that you wanted to bathe her tonight? Yes, yes, that's right. Great. So how have you found the first week? Ah... terrific. Everyone's been very helpful. I see you've been looking for a flat. No, not me. Your mother dropped this off this afternoon. See you later. Darling, it's six o'clock. You don't want to get up. You'll want to got back to sleep. Please! OK. You win. Right... Bath time... Yeah... Good morning. Hi. Sleep well? uh, like a baby. Hear that? Do you want me to take her? No, it's the weekend. Relax. You don't have to do a thing. Yes! One, two, three. One... Two... So... what have you got planned for the weekend? Nothing, I thought I'd just hang out. Amy? I don't want to upset you or anything, but this just isn't going to work. What? This. This what? Your being here. Now... just sitting there. But you just told me not to do anything. I know... yes. I don't want you to do anything, but I'd rather you didn't do it somewhere else. Oh... right... You do understand? Sure. I just need some space, some time one my own. Just me and Sarah. Look, don't look so upset, it's not like anyone died or anything. I think I'd better go now. Mom.. Oh it's so gratifying when he recognizes me. What is it? Do let us in darling. The neighbours would think we're Jehovah's Witnesses. As it's the weekend I thought you need a hand. Come on now! No! Hello. Hi, it's me. Can I come up? Oh! Hi... Look... this is... Just stop it! There was a meeting in the square about the closure of the library... Yes? Well, as I went I thought I might as well drop in. From the square? Yes. But you don't live here Phil. Well it's hardly the point Jack, If we all just cared about our own little patch, what a selfish place the world would be. Now, where's my granddaughter? Hello. Hi. Alright? Fine, thanks. Have you eaten? Oh... yeah. Well come and have a drink then. I won't. No come on,. the baby's down. It'll be nice. OK. How was your day? We were invaded. What have you been up to? Not a lot. I went to see some friends, took in a movie, went out to dinner. I'll get it. I don't believe it! I knew you'd be stuck in with the infant so I thought I just pop over with a bottle and cheer you up. No, this is a surprise! Good night. Hi. Hi. Is Amy here? Yes she is. Come in. I brought you your tips. You always walk around here dressed like that? Mostly, except for when I walk around naked. You practically are naked! Are you sleeping with him? What? I said, are you sleeping with him? Will you keep your voice down. Just answer the question. No. It's none of your damn business. So you are! Knew it. I didn't say that! You didn't say you weren't. You didn't give me a chance. Alright then, are you sleeping with him? Well are you? What if I am? You've only been here a week. Didn't take you that long. How is Susan? That's got nothing to do with it Why did you come here? I told you, I brought your tips. So leave them on the counter and go. I'm late, what else is new! Thanks for ironing my shirt sweetheart. See you later. If you've finished I'll show you out. Of course. Oh shit, I forgot my keys. It's nice to see you again. That got rid of him. What? Why did you do that? Didn't you see his face? Who in the hell do you think you are? 100 a week including service charge. Four weeks up front. Four weeks notice. Cash. No checks. No delays, no excuses we'll all be happy. I thought you said there was a kitchen. Well I wasn't planning on having any large dinner parties. Where's the bathroom? Next floor. You got any toilet paper? You're not staying here! Jack? Come on, we'll take Sarah outside before she catches something. Now wait a moment! Please don't say anything I hate getting aggressive I'm not very good at it and it upsets me for the rest of the day. Amy, come on, we can find something better than this. Oh can we? I looked, that's all I can afford. Well you're gonna have to stay with us then. Oh no! This is stupid. It's a waste of time and it will be a waste of money. I'm not staying with you! Why not? I'm just not, that's all. Why? Because I've had, that's why. Alright, I just had it. I'm tired of the constant criticism during the week and pissed off with sitting in my room every night and weekends pretending I'm not there. You know I'm not a servant for Christ's sake! Nobody said you were! Then stop treating me like one. So fucking English! I don't. You do! You all do. You know I didn't even want this job. I didn't ask for it, you asked me! I don't even know why I'm doing it. I must be crazy. I mean I was perfectly happy being miserable. Amy... The only one who's nice to me is Sarah and she even doesn't know any better. I mean she's a baby. I apologize! OK? I'm sorry. I'm genuinely deeply sorry. Alright? You'll stay? I'll think about it. Good, fine... That settled it. It's gonna mean a pay cut of course. What? We're going to the market, are you coming? She's so good. Such a good baby. Yeah. Don't know where it comes from. Must be her mother's genes, certainly not mine. I had a wonderful day. I really had a good time. Me too. It was fun. Thanks. That's OK, thank you. Good night. Good night. Hello! We're in the tub. Ah right. Amy! What are you doing? I didn't realize you meant WE, I thought you meant we! You don't mind, do you? No, no, not at all. That's great... I think. Yes that's great! Listen are you doing anything tonight? No... Um. I'm not. Why? It's just that I've been invited out for dinner, that's all. It's not important so, if you've got something lined up... No no, you go. Um... Have a great time. You sure? Yeah. Who is it with? Anna. That'll be nice Oh! Big mess! Big mess! No no. This is intolerable. Wonder what I've done now? Look at this. Just look at it. It's ruined. So it's a little darker than it was! It was white! Just leave it, I'll do something about it later. No Miss, you did it. This is the fourth of the child's garments you destroyed in a fortnight. I'll do the washing, so just leave it alone! No, I look after Sarah's clothes Bill. But you don't, and that's precisely my point. I know what you're up to. I don't think that you'll ever step into his wife's shoes, because you won't. Just give it here. No, leave it to me. I said give it here. Give it to me! Let me have it... Let go! Give it to me. Sarah's screaming her head off Amy! Oh! Sweetheart. Nothing's ever ironed properly, Sarah is forever creased. It's her responsibility. It is mine! It was yours, now it's hers. She never puts anything away. Since she came here, everything's been a mess. She's making my job impossible. You're not making hers any easier. Look I'm sorry but there's a point to principle here. Either I do the washing or I don't, and if I'm not allowed to wash the little lady's wardrobe I shall have to consider my position most carefully. Well if you feel you must. Rest assured I shall. I'm sorry about our clothes but it's not true about the mess and you know that. William is a nice man and a good friend. We are family to him, Sarah and I, and that's important to me. OK, so let him do the washing. I don't care, really. We'll see... Play closes at 10:30, so I should be back by 11:00. There's no rush, I'll be asleep. Here's some money for takeaway. Get whatever you... Right... OK. See you tomorrow. Sorry! Almost forgot. Night sweetheart. Well it was an exciting... Jack? What a surprise! Mother, Dad... Do you remember Anna? From work. Managing partner. Of course, yes. How are you? I'm fine thank you. Did you like the play? Yes I... No I didn't. Oh that's good. Neither did I. Well you must both come round to dinner some time. That would be wonderful. Do you play Bridge? Yes I do. Oh excellent. Good night. Good night. Good night. These are this mornings, these are the ones you didn't sign last night and this is your mail Any chance for a coffee? No! Jackie! Is something wrong? No. Oh good. Do you know what really bugs me? You're an attractive man. Loads of women would find you attractive. You can do a lot better that that cell-faced old trout! Jackie! Jackie! A boat... It's a pretty boat, isn't it? Amy. Do you like it? Amy. Alain? What are you doing here? Where's Susan? She couldn't come. She's had to go to the doctor. What is it, what's wrong? She thinks she's pregnant. I see. Congratulations. Thanks. We have to go. Sorry. Hi. Is she asleep? Yes, she was very tired. Amy, what's the matter? What's happened? Nothing. You've been crying. What is it? Has my mother been around? No. You've seen the phone bill. Don't worry about it, it's only money. My money admittedly. Only money. What's wrong? Alain? Do you want to talk about it? You've spoken to Susan? She's called. She was wrong. False alarm! Oh! God, this is so stupid. Do you still love him? I don't know. I don't think so. I don't know... Oh dear, you are in a pickle. Jack... I think I might have to go home. Alright, alright. We'll talk about this tomorrow Poor thing. She's been very good, really Just like her mother She never complained when she was ill. What will you tell her about Sarah Everything I suppose. I tell her stuff now... I know she doesn't understand, but I'm terrified I forget if I don't. I don't mean forget her, but things... little things. I kept her perfume and hair spray for her to smell when she's older, because that's how I remember Sarah in the morning. Silly really! I don't think so. Can't smell a photograph! I can't imagine what it must be like for you, to lose your wife. You know, when there's something really important that you should have done, and you haven't... You've forgotten, and your stomach turns when you remember, it's like that every morning when you wale up. You feel sick, because for a second when you open your eyes... everything's fine. Then it hits you... You remember... and simple things terrify you. The book she was reading, still open where she left it by the bed. Her writing on checkbook stubs... her lipstick on the wine glass... because what touched them... is dead... and it's impossible to believe! But it's true. She's gone! Gone for good... and that's that! I think you're very brave. I think I must go to bed. Good night Sarah. Good night. Good night. There we are, and we're home. Didn't we lock that when we went out? No? Bill! My name is William! I'm not something you call for at the end of the meal. What are you doing? I'm spring cleaning! God, the state of this place! It always looks worse before it looks better. If Jack sees you like this, he'll never have you back. It is vividly so! I wouldn't employ me, would you, mind you, I wouldn't employ you. I'll say you wouldn't be a doll and answer that, would you! Oh my... Jack will kill him. He's back! He's back? Back! Marvelous! We've got to get him out of here. Use the front steps, the front steps... Bye! Bye! My bag. I forgot my bag. Oh! Bag. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. My God! Has William been back? Very much so. Hi Phil. Hello Sarah. Would you like me to drive? I think not. Probably wise. Where do you live William? At the very edge, Madam. At the very edge... Oh God. Yummy, very yummy. This is Sarah. She stayed up late. She's a party girl. Weird day for you? No, it was fine. I know this is against the rules, but... Good night. I was thinking we could go out on Saturday. Dock to Marlow. on the river. Take a picnic. That 'll be nice. Sarah has never been on a boat before. I was thinking of just the two of us. We could stay over. Well, couldn't your mother take care of Sarah? We can pick her up on Sunday. No. What about Phil? No. The weekend is the only time I have with her. I wouldn't enjoy it. I think you would. Sweetie. Sweetie. Please don't let me interrupt. I didn't realize you were still in! What's the mat...? When did you come in? You need to switch those on at both ends, you know? What's wrong with her? Didn't you hear her? She's been screaming for I don't know how long. Guess it's difficult with Ella Fitzgerald in one ear, and her in the other. With respect, I don't think you should talk to me like that. You're forgetting that she is my child. Then with respect, act like her father. What have I done that's so wrong? All I did was forget to turn the thing on. You were in charge of the baby. and I was here, in the house. Trying to get laid! So? What kind of mother do you suppose she'd make? Who? Anna? What's that got to do with anything? Oh work it out for yourself! Uh! What is this? Going to bed with someone is going to bed with them Amy. not a 'will you come and spend the rest of your life with me'! I wouldn't dream of living with Anna any more than she would with me. I never laid it down for a start. and I'd certainly never trust her with Sarah. It's not serious, it's just a bit of fun! She knows that. Well if she didn't before, she certainly does now! Are you happy now? I don't give a shit to be honest. Oh no? I wanna put the baby down, please go away. Give her to me. No, you've been drinking. You'll upset her. I know what this is all about. You're jealous. My mother was right. What? You're angry because you're jealous. All that crap about the Frenchman going home. You never went because you got it too good here. Too good here? You are unbelievable... Truly incredible! So you're not angry? Oh I'm angry, yes, I'm angry alright. With me? Absolutely with you. I knew it, why? Because you go round, like a single man, without a care in the world. You never come home. You're always in the pub or at a party, or out to dinner with her. You always put yourself first. You haven't been back in time to put her to bed in a week do you know that? God this is just like being married! Well maybe it's for you but it sure as hell isn't for me. Well if you don't like it... Fine. You don't deserve her, you're too selfish to be a father. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Oh! Great! We have an argument and you go! Terrific! That's fantastic. Is this going to happen every time we have a row? What exactly am I supposed to do now? Oh you'll be OK! You'll get yourself a nice English nanny until Sarah is old enough to go to school, then you'll send her away! And when she doesn't turn the way you want, you can blame on everyone else. Why not, it's you're right! After all, you paid for it. Isn't that the English way? Do you have any idea what I'm going through? Do you have any conception of how difficult it is for me just to get through the day, every day, do you? Do you ever think about that? Yes! I do. Constantly. Then why can't you make allowances, God alone knows I've made enough for you. Oh! Well, fine! Go. You're right! I would get myself a nanny, a proper nanny. someone who knows her job and her place. I'm sure you will. I'll pick up the rest of my stuff next week. Just make sure I'm at work. I'm late, I'm sorry. Three minutes. Don't worry, I'm sure it won't happen again. Where's Sarah? Baby's bathed and bedded. But I wanted to give her a bath! What am I supposed to do now? Look I don't know! I'm your nanny not your social secretary. Could you babysit on Thursday? Oh! Let me see... Thursday... Oh! Thought so... Bridge. Sorry. William. Come in. I won't... thank you. OK! So what can I do for you? I just came to say that I think you're a fool, an unconscionably stupid blinkered idiot! Oh! Thank you. My pleasure. You couldn't babysit Thursday, could you? Certainly not! I wouldn't mine seeing her myself. When did she leave? Almost four weeks ago. She's probably back in the States. Have you tried her mother? Have you got her number? Sorry! Well if you do see her... I'll tell her to call. I'm off. OK. What are you looking at? Nothing. See you tomorrow. Sure will. Behave! Has that cab not arrived? No sir. Shit! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Have you sent Felicity that check yet? No. Well I wish you would. Very embarrassing for me. It's been over a month now, and I'm playing Bridge with her on Thursday. I resent it. If you resent anyone, it should be that dreadful American girl who'll leave you in a lurch. What's wrong with Sarah? I don't know... she's been off-color for a few days. Teething probably. She doesn't talk to me any more. Well she's a baby, she doesn't talk to anyone. She's pining. What for? That dreadful American girl. Oh don't talk such rot Phil. Oh do shut up Margaret. Phil! So is he! Michael... Margaret, shut up! I can't be doing with any of this. We're going. Can you give me a lift home? I'm not going your way. Thanks. Why are you so upset? I just wish you would all leave me alone to get on with my life. Well if we've done that, you'd be drunk in the gutter somewhere, and Margaret would have Sarah wearing pearls, going to dinner parties and playing Bridge by now. You don't understand. No of course I don't! I've only lost my husband and my daughter, how could I? I'm sorry. It's alright. I feel so guilty all the time. It's terrible. Of course you do, we all do! Every time one of us picks up Sarah and feels happy we feel it. It's awful. Dear... dear Sarah has gone, and there's nothing we can do about that. But you mustn’t feel guilty Jack, that would be a waste of two lives! Three lives! You can't have Sarah grow up saying my childhood was fine, lots of nice nannies, but my father never really got over the death of my mother. And she won't have to... or wouldn't have if you haven't screwed it up. She was lovely... silly boy! Now drive me home. I saw Amy yesterday. Oh yes! How was she? She was getting married. I see! I didn't know, I'm sorry. I wouldn't have said. Come and have some tea. I won't. Please. OK. I've run out of milk. I'll just go down to the shop and get some. I'll get it. No, you take Sarah in, I'll only be five minutes. Put the kettle on. There we are. There we are. Phil... you're back early, what happened? Amy! Jack! Sarah. What are you doing here? And where's Alain? With his wife, I hope. His wife? He and Susan got hitched yesterday. But... That's her bouquet on the mantle, I caught it, God help me! Hi... I missed you! I missed you too. Oh! I wasn't talking to you, but I'm touched nevertheless. That is we... we missed you... both of us. We want you back. My rates have gone up, you can't afford me. Not as a nanny. In that case, you certainly can't afford me! Is that a yes? It's a maybe. That'll do. There's one condition... Name it. I get to tell your mother! Well? Well! Well, come on, spit it out mother. What? Whatever is sticking in your throat. It's Um... Well I'm... still just lost for words, actually. Son comes up with everything! Michael? Oh come on! Can't you just say that you think it's marvelous, wonderful, all the things you're supposed to say? Oh I do... yes really I do... of course I do. Obviously it will be churlish. No honestly I do! Good! Just... take a bit of getting used to, that's all. Darling... I'm really very happy darling. Really! Truly dear. Can we have the bride and groom over here please. Give her a kiss!
