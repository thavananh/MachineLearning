You haven't changed. What's wrong with you? You stink like a wet market. Take a bath. Why are you like that? Before... It's okay even without a bath for a week. You want to. But now, you push me away. Fate is not on my side. Always a failure. It's hard to love. Baldo, even... even a job with daily wage, even, a casual job, just to earn income. I've always wanted to have a baby. But how will it be when the baby comes out? What will we feed it? Sometimes, we only eat twice a day. Sometimes we don't. Don't worry, Libay, It will come soon. Soon. When? Panchong, Very, very soon. Promise. I am not really in a hurry, but... It's almost a year now. You're too much, it has only been eleven months. Jen! you wanted to tell me something? What? What? Are you deaf? Do you remember the first time you came here? You were almost crawling. Just to have a job? What? What? Are you really deaf? That's it! What for? What? Son of a bitch, Jen! What are these rumors that I'm getting part of your commission? Son of a bitch! You have been dancing here for five years! When you have a problem, who do you run to? Me! When you borrow money who do you ask? Me! Now you think you're being cheated, and everyone tells me, son of a-- all about your complaints. It's not true, Bani. You think I'm stupid? You see me as an idiot? You think I wouldn't find out your backstabbing? You're all sons of bitches! Remember this! I know everything that you do here! Even the rumbling of your stomachs! What are you covering?! I know all your lumps, holes and scars in your body! I have it memorized! Son of a bitch! What is this I've heard that you're complaining about your wage? That was your reason why you're losing weight? You son of a-- If you weren't so ravenous with your vices you wouldn't look like a worm! I didn't say anything like that . You sons of bitches! You're all innocent when I confront you! What are you? Maybe you have forgotten you're eating because of me. You are all thinking that I'm just playing around my job? I have no problem with money. You are all my problem. Son of a... After all the sacrifices, I did for all of you. I treat all of you fairly. During the time of Jesus, the tax collector was the one swindling the people. Am I doing that to you. Am I doing that to you? How will I swindle you? When you're all swindlers? Yes, sir? Do you have a vacancy? Just get inside.

You really danced great. What do you want? To be with me or take me to bed? To be with you. Are you there everyday? Every night. How long have you been dancing? Are you still a virgin? - : Of course not! I have done a lot. Why did you say it that way? My friends even call me " Pidol, the Stud". Oh, really? I'm Charisse. Nice name. What? Mine is Benito. Charisse, If you were to choose, A sex maniac or gay? What? If you'd choose. As a boyfriend? Yes. Boyfriend or husband? What kind of question is that? You're gay, aren't you? Here. Let’s see if I'm really gay. Taxi! Sorry but that is all you get with your budget. And Pidol, just keep this, and buy me flowers. Next time, you might get lucky. Why can't you sleep? Where did you go? I just went around. Are you going to work tomorrow? Have you saved some money? How much do they pay you? Do you like what you see? Take me away from here. Take me away from here. Take me far away. If you don't want it, then just watch like you always do. Libay, what would you like your boyfriend to buy for you? I don't know. Why? Are you courting someone? Well? Me? I'm just asking. Maybe, jewelry. Earrings or a watch. Color gold. Or... Expensive clothes. Why? Do you have money now? I was just thinking. I also like... a gold watch. Isn't it nice? Charisse, It's really nice. Just two hundred and fifty. Okay, I will get this. You will get it? You are so lucky . Do you think she'll like this? I'm sure she'll like it. bring it to China Rose, they have cheap gift wrap. What does your mother and father say? Just like before? Asking how you are. It's because, you never answer their letters. I never answer and yet they don’t stop. I don't really know what they want from me. They still even want to know what is happening to me, but they feel bad about me when I left them to do this job, a Teacher in Mabini? My God! That's why I didn't finish school, because I can't handle the kids. They're so annoying. That was a long time ago, Charisse. You have always been like that, as if you have ill feelings. How can they not worry about you? You haven't even told me where you live. Where do you live? Hello. We talked about this already. I'm just around town. Why should I worry when you don't seem to worry about yourself. Right? I just want a peace of mind. I didn't say I was going to bother you. I have my own home. My home is always open for you. I just want to make sure you are okay. When your parents ask me about you, What will I say? That you married an Arab? Became a domestic helper in Taiwan? Or a dancer in a club? What? Oh, my. You worry too much. I am 25 years old, and I want to be independent. Nothing will happen to me, I have a lot of friends. Don't trouble yourself. It’s no trouble for me. I know you are hard headed. But don't come back to me, a failure. And tell me that, "You were right Grandpa". I made a mistake. Charisse, I will laugh at you. What you do is just eat plenty, take a lot of rest, if anything happens to me, I will tell you. Okay? Eat the food that I brought, okay? But where do you really live? Grandfather please. Bye! Bye! [ DJ on the microphone ] Hey, handsome, buy some flowers? There. Thank you. How about you? Flowers? Just one. Where's Charisse? What? Can you afford me now? Or will we end up with nothing? Or not? You're well dressed. Why? Nothing has changed since last night. Same place just different people. Are you trying to impress me? Its not allowed here. I just passed by. I watched you. You're a really good dancer. Hey. Who let you in here? Son of a bitch! This is off limits? They're dressing up! Boss, I'm sorry, I didn't know this was off limits. I'll finish what I want to tell Charisse. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Just let me finish what I was saying and I will leave. Leave him alone! You always pick on those who come here. Everything is not allowed. So what? Dressing up? They just saw me dance naked! Son of a--- Those are Bani's orders Charisse! We'll get in trouble! Then blame me, is that a problem? You are too faithful to him! Why do you talk like this? Are you leaving this place? Because whenever I see you I feel sick. Son of a-- That's enough Bani! He can't fight you! Charisse! Why? What happened? Why are you just standing there? Run after him! Chase him! Where are we going? You want to... Watch a movie? [ Movie playing in background ] There isn't much of a difference watching the movie from the other side. It's just the other way around. Like a mirror. Were you scared a while ago? Yes. You were hardcore. It doesn't seem you. It's not your type. What is my type then? None in particular. You look too kind. You make me paranoid. Ordinary. Like that. You don't like ordinary? It's not that. What do you mean? You're an ordinary person? Is there an ordinary person who lives in a place like this? I don't think so. I'm the, type of person when I'm out on the street, you would never notice. If I die, the world wouldn't lose anything. You know, Benito, you believe the movies too much. Why? It's so dramatic. Movies overact. It's all but illusions. It doesn't really happen. Walking around Luneta Park with balloons? Horseback riding in Baguio, running at the beach, what's that? Sometimes there are even giving gifts of whatever. Oh, my. I've been here in Manila for the longest time, but I've never experienced that. But it happens everytime in the movies. Charisse, What is that? You don't have money, right? Is that what you'd pay me? Sometimes, the movies happen in real life. This is expensive. It's from Canada. Pidol, [ Movie playing in background ] This is the fourth time it happened. Aren't you tired of the riots? I don't know. What's the reason? Is he drunk? Caught by the wife? Or can't pay. It's natural, Chief. This is a beerhouse. People don’t come here to sleep. Just a weird look and trouble starts. You know how the young ones are. That's unlawful. You let minors in here? We have an ordinance. 22 years old Chief. Not a kid. How old are you? Thirty three. You're still young. That's what I meant. And who else are involved? Is he alone? How many were with him? A group? Or he used sheer guts? People now are hungry, whatever you put on the table, People now are hungry, whatever you put on the table, they'd fight over it. They'd even steal fish bones. Even my damned money was taken. and the worst is, my damned worker, Charisse Cobarubias is her name, also known as "Gold" , I don't really have any idea what got into her. I've thought she only finished second grade, but she's smart. She took my money. She left with What's the name of that guy again? I don't know him Bani. He's slim and looks new. They don't know too. Another idiot. The details aren't clear. We will make a report at the office. If you will make the report later, They've probably bought a house and lot by tomorrow. Wait. Hello? Hello? We're still here. Yes. Yes, I know. I will be there for dinner so we can eat together. Okay. Yes. Yes, I miss you. I love you. We'll return. We'll return. That's what you always say, last month it was the same thing. We'll return. After a month for sure., the case has grown into a bigger mess. Your desk must be full of cases on folders Chief? About the death of our security guard a month ago, any news? His family is asking me about it. What do you want? An instant solution? This isn't the only case we have. This is Metro Manila, not a small island. Your case? Maybe you want me to open that again? You are just using your position to push me around. You think we are all criminals? You look at me as a criminal. We don't know what you do at night. Right? Swindle here and swindle there. I'm sorry but I have a motto, "birds of the same feather, understand each other". "Everybody is entitled to own opinion of the other." You son of a bitch! You are not only a criminal, but also an idiot! If you look down on the police, don't you ever count me as one of them. We do our job and you never heard anything foul from us. I owe you? What? You will bribe me? Try it you son of a bitch! I will shove it down your throat. You insult us and mark us as criminals? When you sell these women, is it righteous? People will applaud you for it? Why don't you turn me in, Chief? You know the nature of my work ever since. Why didn't you arrest me then? What for Bani? What for? What will happen, if I arrest you? You will just walk out the next day. Useless. Why are you crying? I'm still a virgin. I know. I'm sorry. It's Dodie. He says it's important Oh, Dodie! It's a long distance call, you didn't say right away! Hello Dodie! How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm fine. Any new ones? New ones? News? Plenty, we are fixing the office. We're renovating. Where's my money? Is it still intact? I need the whole amount. I want four percent in the business, okay? I will be back two days from now. I bought a belt made from crocodile skin for you. It's my gift for you. Take care of my interests there. Do you understand me? Is it clear? Why don't you say something? I repeat, I need my money, all of it. And take care of my interests . That's clear, okay? What? Okay! Okay! Do you understand what I said? Okay, okay! Clear, clear, clear! Okay, alright. Misfortune comes in many forms and this is one of those days damn it! Charisse! Charisse, whose bag is that? That's mine. Whose bag is that? This is mine. You took it from the bar during the fight right? Stand up, okay? This is mine. I've been working in that club for so long, do you think they pay me right? No! I dance every night and attract customers. I just got what I deserve. This isnt stealing! They will not let us get away with this. Son of a bitch! Did you even think of the trouble you caused at the club last night? Because of you I don't have a job now. I took this because I need it. If you want out, then fine. It’s my problem. You know Charisse, Bani's going to take it personally. Damn it! You just don't care! I don't care? If you want your life that way, it's fine. That's your choice. I'm want something more. You got what you wanted from me last night, so leave me alone. I don't care now? You better find a way. Good luck. Hey. You look really tired. You must have had a lot of customers. Can I borrow money? Is that bag leather? I have something to show you. It's beautiful. Someone is selling it because she needs money. -What is it? Come on. Is that yours or did you steal it again? Of course not! It's like this, It's being sold because the owner lost in a card game last night. Look it's beautiful. 14 karats, two installments. - I don't have money. I don't like it. Its just ten thousand. If only I had money, I would buy it. You really have no money. - Is it your type? Vian, if someone looks for me tell them I'm at the club. And I will clean my room, don't clean it for me. Aida! Aida! Vian! Don't let anyone in my room. - Yes. Ok, take care! Stay here. Ok. Aida. What happened? Vian what are you doing there? Shut up. You will get in trouble. Do you want to get evicted? Out! I thought you were a dancer Charisse? You woke up early today. You know me Charisse. I don't have the money. Where is it? The money is not with me. I heard that answer already Charisse. Again, where is the money? You're annoying. I told you I don't have the money. We've been together for eight years, You know, I won't let this go, especially Dodie. You are getting physical Charisse. I miss that. I know everything about you Charisse. Vivian is your landlady, a bit old but still sexy, even sexier than you. That is where you live, Vivian’s Dormitory along the railway. But you don’t care about her, even if we eat her alive. How about your grandfather Charisse? His house is at Kalachuchi street number 12 with green gate, old and rusty, right beside Sandy's bakery. He doesn't go out much due to his age. He loves to take care of animals, plants and ducks. On Sundays, he goes out and comes back after three hours with a bag of turnips and flowers. I was thinking Charisse, can he still dance if we electrocute him? Will he scream when he feels pain? can he still dance if we electrocute him? Will he scream when he feels pain? Your relatives in the province? Do we have to involve them? They are a lot . But I can look for them and skin them alive. Just to show you how much trouble you are in. Dodie Sarcon. Do you remember Dodie Sarcon? He held downtown for seven years, everybody was afraid of him. He has a calculator for a brain, and no heart. He is the only person I know without a conscience. Nobody borrows from Dodie and does not pay. For 64,000 pesos Charisse, you will destroy your life. Don't you value your life? You know he will not let this pass, and you have his money. . I really don't have to do this, because Dodie will hunt you down. Don't make it hard on yourself, Charisse. Dodie is known not only to kill his enemies but also the relatives and loved ones. From the grandfather to their pets, Even the beloved cat or dog. When Dodie is collects, everybody pays. Sixty four thousand pesos! Where's the money? Where is the bag, Charisse? I will count to sixty four! One, Two, Three, Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty! Sixty one. Sixty two. Sixty three. How did they get here? What are you doing? Let's go Charisse, let's go! What happened? It's money you took, right? You didn't return it? I thought so. I will bring you to the hospital. No hospitals. Look at you. You have to go. No hospitals! No doctors! Dodie Sarcon. Bani works at the club. He's Dodie's henchman. It’s his money. If we should be afraid, it's Dodie. We'll be lucky if he'll ignore us. Its either he wants something from you or is angry. He has money invested and used to run clubs and gambling joints. If there's money, it's his. Now Bani is dead, he will come after me now. So let them try to find us. It can't be. they will go after my family, my relatives. They even know where my grandfather lives. They know everything about me, and I'm sure he knows about you too. What else will you tell me about Dodi to be afraid of? We only have until 10 p.m.. Benito, you must go. It's my problem. Come with me. We will return the money. I will take care of it. Trust me. Why will I go with you? Who are you? What do you know about me? I don't even know you. Why are you so brave to say you will take care of it. Who are you to me? Nothing. Look Benito, there are a lot of men who wants me and you are just one of them. You just want something and I gave it to you last night. What else do you want? You just want to have me. No. No? And you? Wasn't it you just used me to get out of trouble? Then we're even. We're not even. Look at you. The police are after you. Even Dodie. If you were in my place? Would you still help me? Charisse, I'm an idiot with these things, but it's the first time this happened to me. And I could really feel, the difference of what I feel for you. You don't know what you are saying. The time of courtship and serenades are over. There is no love. You can buy love at the corner. At every corner, it's easy. Like my mother and father, they loved each other when they got married. Where are they now? Separated. With different partners. Love is for fools. It's nothing. Only money is real. There are many like me, Benito. I'm not the only one who dances at night. You will meet many more. You can go to a lot of places. For someone like me. This happens only once. But, once it happens, I stand up for it. You really don't know what you're saying. I didn't know Benito was the type. Even the girl he was with. I didn't know Benito worked at Go Ting Lee. I know. We went there. Okay. We're done. If we still need anything, I know where to find you. Can I have a cigarette? An 8850? It's nice. I used to have a phone like that but was stolen. This one. Do you know her? I don't know her but I saw her with Benito. Okay, we're done. You better take me with you. I know Benito, I can help you. No need to. We can handle it. We're fine. Are you married? Not officially. Okay. I'll wait for you here, okay? We will go to Dodie. You know where to find him, right? Where's the money? Tanchong will kill me if I didn't pay him. Do you understand? You are a bitch Vivian, damn you! If not for you I wouldn't be here! My life is at stake here! You Thief! Where is the money? - I will not run away. I will pay you. I will pay you. I will pay you. - Bitch I will kill you! Son of as bitch! If I didn't pay Tanchong, You'll have nowhere to live. This house is my collateral. Everything in it is my collateral. Everything! You're really a bitch Vivian! You're fooling all of us! You're really a bitch! - Charisse, wait! Charisse! Charisse! Nothing will come out of your anger! - Bitch! Charisse! When did you give the money? This evening. While I was cooking the food for Charisse. Where can we find Tanchong? Excuse me, I know where he stays. They always drink near the TV shop. You know that Vivian, right? In front of the tricycle terminal, right across it. From all of us boss, who loves you, We wish you a happy, happy birthday. We hope you live a long life - Boss... for more happiness like these! - Boss? Boss, happy birthday! - Boss, I'm Benito. I am with Charisse. We're from Bonifacio. Sir? We left something here. We just wanted to get it. Something? What is it? An electric fan or oven toaster? We just want to get our... money. Money? Boys, he said money! Not here. Sir, sir, You know who gave you the money. It's Vivian. Vivian owes me money. Vivian paid me already. You, you are disturbing my singing! So you better look for Vivian and disturb her instead! You pests! Damn it! Boss. We really need the money. Especially at this time. Right now only you can help us. - Why?! Why are you pregnant? Are you about to give birth? No, Boss. We won't come to you if we weren't really in need. It's because, Please have pity on us. Pity, pity, pity! You want me to pity you? I don't even know you and I have to pity you? Yes, you both look innocent, but just like Judas, before he betrayed God, he looked innocent too. But the both of you, you're both Judas! You even ruined my singing! You sons of bitches get out of here! Get out! Damn you! You know, we can't do anything. We're talking to fools here so, let's leave! If you don't want to help me, - Let's fix this another way. then I'll do this alone. You can leave. Charisse, you wanted to come here. Fix this. I'm leaving. Now you give up on me you son of a bitch! If wasn't for you, I wouldn't be in this trouble! You are a coward! A coward! Charisse! What? Let's fix this. Let's get out of here. If you want to run away, go! Sir? Sir? I need it, Sir? Where is the-- money! You're disturbing me! Wait, Charisse. This guy is worse than Bani. Hey, hey, hey!@ I don't like the tone of your voice! Alright. - Don't turn your back on me. You son of a bitch! You are a nuisance! Now go away! Out! Get out of here! I already told you! What? Get out of here! You are a coward. Come on fight! What? What are you trying to prove? You're nothing! Fight me! You won't fight? You won't fight? You better learn your lesson this time. Let's go. I thought you were very brave. I thought you had many friends? Many to look after you, where are they? Grandpa, This is different. I know. From the time I saw both of you. I know you are in big trouble. What do you need? Money? Is that the solution? You know I wouldn't come to you if I could handle it. Why? Is your friend in trouble? Is he married? You? Are you married? Is that why she's like that? What's your name? Benito sir. What do you plan to do now? Go hide in the province? Hide? This looks very serious. I don't know. Don't worry, I will take care of her. Oh, you kids... You think you can handle the whole world. Charisse, you told be before, you had no problems at all. But now you're here, with me, crying. What kind of responsibility is that? And you, Vicencio, I mean, Benito. Can you really take care of my granddaughter? I don't know with the both of you! Here, take this, I hope it helps you. It's my one month worth of my pension, dear. Grandpa, how about you? Don't worry about me. I can manage here on my own. I don't really go out. You better start praying. That's why this is happening to you, you don't pray. Okay, grandpa, We'd get over this. We might go to mass. Okay, grandpa. My, dear. - We'll go ahead. Pray to God that He will guide you to the right path. Why are the police always late at the crime scene? If they only called this would not have happened to them, Sir. Sir. Sir, Bani's car is missing. Those two took it. It's at the back. Yes. I saw it a while ago. Come here, have many copies done and give it to the other units. Yes, Sir. Declare the two as APP. What is this? So we can get out of here. I chose a far unknown place, Tacloban. Really? You will just leave and escape all of this? Charisse, we will leave and escape. Don't you want that? To go far away? And who said I will go with you? Are you crazy? Is all of this just nothing to you? They're looking for us, they will kill my family. Charisse! Can I just ask you? I'm doing this for you and does it mean anything? Benito. after tomorrow, everything will be nothing, if our loved ones will be dead. Charisse, it also means nothing if we're not together. My hunger can't be satisfied by food anymore. There's no value in money even if it can buy anything I want. Wake up Benito. I will make you choose. We will leave together, but the world will end, and we will stay, or let's face Dodie, and we can still be with our loved ones? We will not be together if we face Dodie. Maybe you just want to stay here because... Because of Dodie. You just don't want to be with me. This is Manila, Benito. There's no love here. If I go on that boat alone , what will you do? I will bring that empty bag, to Dodie, and beg. Nice plan right? If I do that, for you, will you come with me? Do what you have to do, I can't promise anything. Do it for yourself, Benito. Not for me to owe you. Do you love me Charisse? I will do this for you Charisse. Not for myself. I will do this because I love you. Keep this ticket for now, and when I get back, and you're still here, it means, you love me too. And you'd come with me. If not, Put that away for now. Have a seat. What happened to your face? Like you just came out from guts of a shark, who just spat you out. You're late. So, I ordered for you. Waiter, - Excuse me. These are oysters. In Tagalog, talaba. These are cheap in the province, sometimes you can get them for free. I don't know why it’s so expensive here. The problem is, do you still have the appetite to eat? It looks like you can't even chew. I think I should just order some porridge for you, or congee. Did Charisse beat you up? That crazy cat is really something. How is Charisse? The last time I saw her she was like fresh out of kindergarten. But she is really something a really good dancer. So the police are hunting you now? I admire you, boy. You're tough. But it doesn't suit you. Most of those feared looks like goons, like criminals. That's why, most of the time we should be careful with those who looks like a saint. Why did you stand up? Are you goons? Ben, do you believe that money makes the world turn? Since I was a kid, I've believed that to be true. Even now, that I'm old. I still believe that idea. What is mine is mine. In this world nothing is free, nothing falling from the heavens. Everything we have to fight for. Because you know why? Nothing comes in this world for free, you've got to pay for it! I don't read the bible much, but this I can tell you. Life down here is different from the life up there. I know a lot of people who go to church to pray, they go to confess their sins everyday. Cleansing themselves from sin. But look at them, they still have nothing to eat, They're all full of sins. They're all poor idiots. Why? Everyday, the price of rice keeps increasing, and the others live in small shanties. When floods come, they're washed away. They're left with nothing. There are those just walking along the road, and get run over by a jeep. So, they're dead. And why? All of them, rely on God. Now... ask me Ben, who will you rely on? On God or yourself? Me? I will not rely in God. I will rely on myself. Why? Maybe he cannot hear me. Maybe he is going crazy with all those praying and asking for help. In the end, What is the solution to man’s problems that God cannot solve? Money right? Hey, it's money, right? That is why some people forget themselves and steal what is not theirs. It’s an obsession, Benito. Benito, I will make the one who takes my harvest, pay. Why? What happened? Did I say something bad? My stomach hurts. Where is the comfort room? Why? Are you going to shite? Nervous? Prinsal! Go with him. He might make a mess here. Don't worry leave this with me. You are coming back after all, we still have to talk. Take care of him and don't touch him. Hey, you! You are all sick! Ten four. We are on our way. Don't let them get away. Let's go. Let's go. I'm coming. Just a minute. Come on. What's taking you so long? Because, Okay. A person be it a fugitive or criminal, has his dignity to keep. Judas, when he sold Jesus, hanged himself. What do you think? The dignity is enough for what was lost? But you, up to your last moment, you are a cheat! You have no vale for dignity. Tonight, I will take something that is not mine. And that is, your life! This was just how it was the first time I killed. The difference is, I was standing then, now I am on the ground. He was begging for his life but I still killed him.] It;s true. I can see myself in you, Benito. Finish it. Finish it. Finish it now. Finish it now. I'm sorry. Sir, Where is he? We have followed the subject. Where's your men? - We have deployed them there. Let's go. Charisse! Good morning, honey! I'm on my way home. I will have breakfast there. Even just sardines. It's over, and done with. But we got only the girl. They were two, a male and a female. I don't know their relationship, either as boyfriend or cousin. They were not together, we will know later, if they'll meet. Or maybe they're enemies. Or maybe just bad timing. They're still young. Ordinary people but, have killed so many. Why? I don't know yet. Maybe money. It’s always about money. They are all like that, all of them. Just because of money. My God.
