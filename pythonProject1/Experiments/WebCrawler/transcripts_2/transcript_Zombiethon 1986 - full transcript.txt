Run away before it's too late. [music playing] [heavy breathing] [music playing] [growling] [music playing] [gun shot] The boat can leave now. Tell the crew. [music playing] [groaning] [gasping] [screaming] Don't move. Stay where you are, mister. Put your hands on the deck there. I told you not to move. I mean it. One more step and I'm going to blast you. Now, please, where you are. Don't move I said. Don't move. [gun shots] Let's stop for a while. I want to take some shots. How about it? Come on. It looks fantastic down below. OK. [music playing] [shaky breathing] [panting] [music playing] [sighing] [strange noise] [gasping] [crashing] [moaning] [thudding] [panting] [screaming] You ever heard of voodoo? It makes the dead stand up and walk. Hey. Look out! [crashing] [scary music] Ah! Ah. [gunshots] [music playing] Ah. Ah. [scary music playing] In these islands, fantastic legends, voodooism, zombies. Been rife for centuries. As a man of science, I don't believe in voodooism, but the phenomenon defies logical explanation. [groaning] [wind blowing] Ah. [gunshot] [music playing] [gunshot] [music playing] Ah! Ah. Ah. Ah. [wind blowing] WOMAN: Oh. [gunshot] Oh. Oh. [gunshot] Oh. Oh. [gunshots] You bring some too. Come on. [wind blowing] [scary music playing] Ah! [explosions] [music playing] [gunshots] Brian, two more. Get out of here. Go. Oh. Uh. [scary music playing] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Shoot her, West. Shoot her! What are you waiting for? [gunshot] Come on, Brian. Let's get to the boat. Well, let's see if we can find something more cheerful on the radio. MAN (ON RADIO): The latest news on the situation here in New York City, since the discovery of the first zombie, is getting worse by the hour. There's chaos in the streets. The National Guard cannot control the situation. In every borough of the city, from Brooklyn to Manhattan, from Harlem to Queens, the zombies are taking over. I've just been informed that zombies have entered the building. They're at the door. They're coming in! Ah! [music playing] [scary music playing] [gunfire] Last one. All right. Wait. I'll show you. - I'll show you. - You can't swim. What? I was champion at Walla Walla Ding Dong College. My ass you were. I'll be halfway across before you get your pants off. That's not fair. You're not wearing panties. Help me get down. Be careful your step. Maybe you're right. Maybe there are swimming-- Come back. I was kidding. In you go. [music playing] [scary music playing] We picked a nice spot for a change. Uh-huh. We did. Last year, we camped on a parking lot. It was terrible. You painted your toenails. I like blue. You cut yours. [music playing] [scary music playing] [screaming] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh! The lake! The lake! The lake! [scary music playing] Ah! Ah! [birds chirping] [scary music playing] Ah! Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah! Ah! [scary music playing] Ah! Ah! I think you should try it. What? Hold it. What are you thinking of? Napalm. Ah. Ah. Ah. [music playing] WOMAN: (VOICEOVER) I couldn't sleep. The magic of the night made me restless. The distant sound of the eternal surf washed over me in waves of secret sensations I'd never felt before. The relentless rhythm swept through my body again and again, an irresistible call I could not ignore. I was overcome by waves of emotion, drawing me toward the shore, luring me into the night, into the depths of the darkness. Dawn was breaking through the clouds. High above a hot wind rustled the palms. The scent of static electricity crackled in my nostrils. The air itself was filled with magic. The scent of the supernatural overwhelmed me. I felt drawn by some ancient urge, some prehistoric instinct that still lives today. A soft breeze stirred. A warm wind breathed heat into the cool shadows, luring me into the unknown. If there is a secret to the universe, I know it lies inside myself. If only I could see into my soul. [music playing] The fragrance of the flowers was intoxicating. I fell under their spell. No earthly enchantment could compare with their powers of seduction. [music playing] The murmuring shadows whispered to me from the deep tanglewood. I was being drawn down toward my destiny. [music playing] [mysterious music playing] Somewhere down below, the dead are waiting to rise. When the gods are restless, the dead walk again. [music playing] [scary music playing] Let the flames of hell begin, the fire without, the fire within. I want more out of life. Let's go to a movie. [scary music playing] Ah. Ah. Look. What's that over there. Where? I heard a noise, some kind of a creaking sound. I'm afraid. Let's get out of here. I find it rather romantic. If I wanted romance, I wouldn't have come out 300 miles into the desert with you. In fact, I wonder why I ever accepted. Come on. Let's do something exotic, she said, so here we are, looking at romantic palm trees. I should have stayed home-- the sea you half a mile down the road, beaches, the riding ranch next door, lobsters, wine. Instead, we get this. I'm leaving. I'm getting back to the car. You know what? You're no fun. [scary music playing] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! No! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [music playing] [tank rumbling] [gunfire] Let the dead bury the dead. Get it out of your memory. My men told me that there were no survivors. The nomads say the dead are still alive, and evil powers strike all those who come near. The Oasis is damned. [scary music playing] MAN: Ah. Ah. Ah. Stop! Stop! Man, it's me. Remember me, sir? Stop, I said. [gunshots] [scary music playing] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [birds chirping] There's nothing like a nice, cold back. I can think of something even better. [music playing] I've got to get back to the others. I hate to leave you like this. I don't mind waiting till we're rich. Ah! Ah! No! No! Ah! No! No! [wind blowing] MAN: But they're everywhere. Fire, build a fire. WOMAN: What do you mean? MAN: Fire is the only thing that stops them. Ah. WOMAN: Oh. MAN: Let's go. WOMAN: Oh. Oh. Oh. MAN: Wake up! WOMAN: Ah. Ah. Ah. MAN: Hurry up, if they must do it. MAN: It hardly burns. We need more gas. WOMAN: It's pouring out so slow. [scary music playing] Ah. Ah. Ah. No. No. No. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. [explosions] Oh. Oh. Oh. [music playing] Did you find what you were looking for? I mainly found myself. [exciting music playing] It's over, Michael. Michael, let go. Oh, Penny, you had us frightened to death. Go. Drink it. Feel better now? Yes. Thanks. Thank heavens, it was the last scene. Good? Very effective scene, quite realistic, it looked as if you-- you really wanted to murder her. [scream] [scary music playing] [birds chirping] Ah! Ah! [scary music playing] [wind blowing] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [thunder crashing] [music playing] [chainsaw] [thunder crashing] Ah! No! No! [scary music playing] Michael! Ah! [upbeat music playing] [grunting] Ah! Ah! All those pretty jewels have been buried along with her? You know damn well they were. What a waste of money. When the Professor gets over his grief, he'll dig her up again. I beg your pardon. If I let you come in here while I'm getting ready to go to bed, what more do you want? Don't push your luck, or I'll never have you here again. I want us to get married, Maria. I've got money. Oh. [laughing] I'd never marry a man with such a stupid face, and besides, I'm in no hurry to be miserably poor living in a hut, like a farmer's wife. [laughing] You're not a man. You're a gorilla, and look at me. I'll do anything to have you Maria. Simply show that you're really a man. That couldn't be easier. Imbecile. Turn away. [laughing] You and I will get married on the day you're able to present your wife with a diamond necklace. You're crazy. They cost a fortune. It could be possible, my dear, if you used your brain. Are you trying to say-- You could be rich just like that. It would be so easy. No. Don't ask me. Superstitious about graves? Huh? Afraid of poor Cecille? Suppose I go. Will you marry me? I will. Wait here. Maria. Ready. MARIA: You'll be happy when you're married. [music playing] Cut it. Cut it with this. You're hurting me. Ah! Ah! [whip cracking] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! MAN: Get back to the castle. Ah! She is yours. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. [music playing] Uh. Uh. Uh. Ah. Ah. Oh. Oh. Help. Oh. Oh. Oh. [upbeat music playing] [groaning] [noise maker] [groaning] [noise maker] [music playing] [scary music playing] Ah! Ah! [church bell ringing] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [upbeat music playing] [dog barking] [heart beating] [scary music playing] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [music playing] [computer beeping] Francho, prepare for a 10.2 memory extraction. [clock ticking] Francho, I have the blood exchanger ready. We must get the patient into the thermal freeze vault before cellular deterioration takes place. This time, you was not fail to remove the emotional characteristics. Our only hope of recovering origin creation is to be sure that this brain is a pure calculating machine. Now. [whirring] It is done, Francho. We will add this circuit to the memory bank, until we can effect an exchange with the first astral man. One day, we'll be able to fill the memory bank with the most brilliant minds in the world, preserved forever for the benefit of mankind, to call on them for their knowledge. Good enough, Francho. The blood exchanger. Get him into a thermal freeze vault. If we are to preserve the patient until we can complete the synthetic heart transplant, there must be absolutely no cellular decomposition whatever. We must move quick enough. [whirring] [music playing] [scary music playing] Ah! [music playing] Who are you? Come on. Who are you? Ah! Kill him. Why? I said, kill him. [gunshots] Don't you ever question my orders again. [computer beeping] Seems our Dr. Dimarco has succeeded in creating a subservient zombie, not someone who questions orders. It's obvious the voltage and frequency boost will not affect an override. [suspenseful music playing] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! [music playing] We are aware of your experiments, doctor. We know that you have succeeded in creating an astral zombie. How did you know that? The recent murders, the news description of the suspect, and a tape of your lecture at the astroscience conference. Yes, he's the only complete astral mobilization I've been able to effect to date. Unfortunately, however, not terribly successful. The only being available to me at the time was that of a psychopathic killer, but I have prepared a new astral man. And who is this man? Francho, my assistant-- able, loyal, and unfortunately, mute. Fortunate for him. All right, hold it! [gunshots] [exciting music playing] [groaning] [gunshots] [gunshots] [scary music playing] [gunshot] The only hope for those people out there is to destroy him. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! No. You must not. You must find a way to control him. There is no way. We must destroy him. Then, we can complete mobilization of the second astral man whose brain is morally pure. [gunshot] Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! No. [gunshot] [whirring] I'm Satana. You must obey my commands. Kill them. I said kill. [gunshots] [noise makers] [upbeat music playing]
