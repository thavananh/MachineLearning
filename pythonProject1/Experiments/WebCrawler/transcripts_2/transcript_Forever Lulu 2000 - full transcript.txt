NO WONDER YOU WRITE FOR FUCKING TELEVISION! I MEAN, JACK KEROUAC, HE WOULD NEVER HAVE MARRIED A UPTIGHT BITCH LIKE THIS. CHARMING, BEN. WAS SHE ALWAYS THIS RUDE? SHE LOOKS LIKE MARTHA STEWART. WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? HUH? YOU KNOW, HE MAY HAVE MARRIED YOU, BUT HE LOVED ME FIRST. DIDN'T YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? NOTHING. IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT? BEN? TELL HER, BEN. YES. I LOVED YOU FIRST. OKAY? NOW, CAN WE TAKE THIS OUT OF THIS LOBBY? YOU CAN STAY NOW, IF YOU WANT. YOU DID WHAT? YOU BROKE THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT? OH, MY GOD. I'M GONNA HAVE TO PRAY FOR YOUR SOUL RIGHT HERE. PLEASE FORGIVE HER FOR BEING SUCH A SLUT. SHE REALLY DIDN'T MEAN IT. YOU JUST DID IT WITH A PERFECT STRANGER? YEAH. WHY? WHY, BEN? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE 'CAUSE I FELT LIKE IT! AND YOU JUST COULDN'T WAIT TO TELL ME ABOUT IT, COULD YOU? WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MY LIFE?! DAMN IT! (MUTTERING) (GRUNTS) (SLAMS) (GRUNTS) HE'S REALLY ANGRY. GOOD. OH. YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T CHEAT ON YOU. I MEAN, I TRIED EVERYTHING THAT I COULD TO GET HIM TO CHEAT ON YOU, BUT HE WOULDN'T. I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW THAT. I KNOW. SO NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY FEELING VERY SORRY, REGRET SETTING IN, REMORSE. I'M SURE YOU FEEL REALLY GUILTY. OOH! SHUT UP! ♪ GUILTY, GUILTY, GUILTY YES! I FEEL GUILTY! OKAY? ARE YOU HAPPY?! GOD! THIS IS RIDICULOUS. WHAT AM I EVEN DOING IN THIS ROOM WITH YOU? YOU HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF PENT-UP ANGER, DON'T YOU? YOU MUST BE AN AWFUL THERAPIST. I AM AN EXCELLENT THERAPIST. HOW ABOUT IF I BE THE JUDGE OF THAT? YOU SHOULD GO TALK TO BEN. OH, REALLY? DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE ADVICE? MAYBE YOU'D, UM, LIKE TO BE OUR MARRIAGE COUNSELOR. DID YOU KNOW THAT SOMETIMES I ASK MY PILLOW LATE AT NIGHT "HOW MUCH SADNESS DO I HAVE TO FEEL?" AND DO YOU KNOW THAT LOVE IS THE WORLD'S GREATEST PAINKILLER? AND MARILYN MONROE WORE A MASK OF TRAGEDY OVER HER PUBIC HAIR. YOU'RE RIGHT. I-- I THINK I SHOULD GO TALK TO BEN. WHY DIDN'T YOU AND BEN EVER HAVE ANY KIDS? WAS IT BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO BUSY WITH YOUR PRACTICE? (CHUCKLES) TOO BUSY BEING A DOCTOR? I MEAN, WE KNOW THAT HE'S NOT IMPOTENT. THAT'S FOR SURE. NO, HE'S NOT. WHAT? WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT? BEN AND I DID HAVE A CHILD... A SON. HE DIED OF LEUKEMIA LAST YEAR. HE WAS 5. I'M SURPRISED BEN DIDN'T TELL YOU. THAT'S ABSURD! SHE NEVER MENTIONED A SON TO ME. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY-- OBVIOUSLY SHE WAS HALLUCINATING. NO. IT IS NOT A HALLUCINATION AND IT'S NOT A LIE. TRUST ME. AND YOU'VE SPOKEN TO THE ADOPTIVE PARENTS? THEY KNOW THAT YOU'RE COMING? YES. AND THEY KNOW EVERYTHING. (KNOCK ON DOOR) HOLD ON. NOW WHAT? NO, NOT YOU. WHAT WERE YOU SAYING? HEY, HEY, HEY. I'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA. MY, UH, LOVING WIFE IS HERE, WHO HAPPENS TO BE A SHRINK. YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE A GREAT TIME JERKING EACH OTHER OFF. BEN, WHO IS THAT? LULU'S THERAPIST. KNOCK YOURSELF OUT. I'M GONNA GET DRUNK. OH, GOD. HELLO. THIS IS DR. CLIFTON. NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO. NO, NO. HEY, LULU. IT'S ME. OPEN UP. NO. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. I'M FINE. I'M FINE. I'M JUST A GIRL WITH SCARED WRISTS WHO CAN'T SIT STILL. LULU, OPEN THE DOOR. PLEASE! BEN, SHE'S OFF HER MEDICATION. I KNOW THIS, CLAIRE. DO YOU HAVE YOUR KEY? NO. LISTEN. NO! I DON'T WANT MY FUCKING MEDICATION BECAUSE IT MAKES ME FEEL NOWHERE, AND I DON'T LIKE TO FEEL NOWHERE BECAUSE THAT'S NO FUN! I WOULD LIKE TO BREAK WINDOWS! I WOULD LIKE TO SMASH GLASSES! She's breaking down, Ben. I MEAN, WHO GIVES A FUCK IF THE KITCHEN KNIVES LOOK REALLY FRIENDLY? LULU! LULU, PLEASE OPEN UP! LULU, OPEN UP! CAN'T WE JUST CLOSE OUR EYES AND COUNT BACKWARDS AND LET THE RAIN FALL ON OUR FACES? LULU, PLEASE OPEN UP. PLEASE! ALL RIGHT. I'LL GET THE KEY. YOU GET THE PRESCRIPTION. GET ON A PLANE AND GO HOME. MAYBE YOU'LL GET LUCKY AGAIN. LULU, OPEN THIS DOOR! LULU McAFEE IS A 38-YEAR-OLD SINGLE WHITE FEMALE WHO'S BEEN HOSPITALIZED OVER 30 TIMES FOR ATTEMPTED SUICIDE AND SELF-MUTILATION. AT NIGHT SHE CAN BE BELLIGERENT. SHE DOES NOT LIKE LOUD NOISES. SOMETIMES SHE FEELS A THORN IN HER FOOT WHERE THERE IS NO THORN. AND THEN SHE STUMBLES, AND SHE NEARLY TUMBLES TILL SHE REACHES OUT AND A STRANGER'S HAND HOLDS HER. YOU BETRAYED ME, CLAIRE! YOU FUCKING BETRAYED ME. I KNOW! I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY! BUT SHE NEEDS SUPERVISION; OKAY? I HAVE SUPERVISED HER VERY WELL FOR 2,000 MILES. COULD YOU OPEN THE DOOR? WE LOCKED OURSELVES OUT. I UNDERSTAND. BUT THINGS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW, BEN. SHE'S ABOUT TO SEE HER SON FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME TOMORROW-- YOU'RE FORGETTING SOMETHING HERE, CLAIRE. HE'S MY SON, TOO. LULU. HEY. HEY. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH. IS THERE ANYTHING-- SIT DOWN. BEN, WHY DIDN'T TELL ME THAT YOU HAD A CHILD THAT DIED? BEN, PLEASE. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS. TALK? TO YOU? I TRIED THAT CONSTANTLY. BUT YOU PUT YOUR PAIN IN SOME PRETTY LITTLE BOW-TIED BOX THAT I CAN'T TOUCH. YOU OBVIOUSLY BURIED ANY LOVE YOU HAD FOR ME WITH IT. THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU BOTH NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? I WANT YOU TO TELL ME. TELL YOU WHAT? TELL ME ABOUT YOUR SON. TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HATE IT THAT EVERYWHERE I LOOK I SEE HIS FACE? IN THE CLOUDS, IN THE WINDSHIELD, IN THE BLANK PAGE IN MY TYPEWRITER. AND THEN OTHER TIMES I CAN'T SEE HIM AT ALL, AND IT KILLS ME. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? OR HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT I FEEL I'M DYING INSIDE AND THERE'S NOT A GODDAMNED THING I CAN DO ABOUT IT? I JUST CAN'T STOP HEARING HIS VOICE. I'M IN THE MALL, JOGGING IN THE PARK, AND I HEAR HIM SAY, "YOU'RE FUN, DADDY." HE USED TO SAY THAT ALL THE TIME WHEN WE WERE HORSING AROUND. "YOU'RE FUN, DADDY. YOU'RE FUN, DADDY." THAT'S GOOD. WHAT WAS HIS NAME? AN... (SOBBING) SAY IT, BEN. ANDREW. ANDREW. THAT'S A GOOD NAME. IT'S LIKE MY DREAMS DIED WITH HIM. NOW I HAVE SOME SON THAT I KNOW WHO ALREADY KNOWS IT ALL, AND HE'S NOT GONNA BE INTERESTED IN ANYTHING I HAVE TO SAY. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. YOU THINK HE CARES ABOUT US? OH, MAYBE. AND MAYBE NOT. BUT WE CAN LET HIM KNOW THAT WE CARE ABOUT HIM, YOU KNOW. WE'RE GONNA SEE HIM, LULU. (SOBBING SOFTLY) CLAIRE, I THINK I NEED MY MEDICATION. OKAY. IT'S OKAY. I'M SORRY. OKAY? WOW. WELL, THIS KID'S PARENTS GOT TO HAVE SOME BUCKS. (CLAIRE) YEAH. NICE NEIGHBORHOOD. BEN, I THINK YOU SHOULD PULL OVER. NO. IT'S 216. WE'RE NOT THERE. IT'S THE NEXT BLOCK. I KNOW. BUT LULU HAS SOMETHING TO TELL YOU BEFORE WE GET THERE. SO CAN YOU PULL OVER NOW? SO, WHAT? THIS IS ERIC-- LINDA DAVIS' FROM VALLEY VIEW. YOU KNOW? AND WHEN WE CALLED THE PARENTS, THAT WASN'T THE PARENTS. THAT WAS FREDDIE. AND FREDDIE'S AT VALLEY VIEW. HE'S CRAZIER THAN I AM. THAT'S FOR SURE. AND YOU WERE RIGHT. I FORGED THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME? I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT, UM, I LIED. THAT THIS IS NOT OUR SON. HE'S NOT OUR SON? YOU WERE BULLSHITING ME FOR 2,000 MILES? NO!-- YES. I MEAN, SORT OF. DON'T-- DON'T EVEN-- TALK! DO NOT TALK, LULU! WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO TO ME?! NOTHING. I CAN'T-- LOOK! I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE! LOOK. I'VE GOT A SON; I DON'T HAVE A SON. WHAT IS THIS, FUCK WITH BEN WEEK?! BEN, JUST LISTEN TO HER! AND WHAT ABOUT YOU? IF YOU WANT TO GET RID OF ME, I'LL DO IT FOR YOU. HOW'S THAT?! WE HAVE A SON. WE HAVE A SON! I HAVE A SON? YES, WE HAVE A SON. THIS IS NOT HIM. THIS IS ERIC. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS EARLIER BEFORE I MADE A COMPLETE ASS OUT OF MYSELF? BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID THAT YOU WOULDN'T COME WITH ME. SO WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD? YOU THINK WE'RE LITERALLY GONNA SHOW UP AT THIS KID'S HOUSE AS IS BIOLOGICAL PARENTS-- "HEY, HERE'S MOMMY AND DADDY. AFTER 16 YEARS, WE'RE HERE TO SCREW WITH YOUR LIFE!" BEN, LULU TOLD ME ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT. I HAVE CONTACTED THE PARENTS AND THEY HAVE AGREED, AS LONG AS IT'S OKAY WITH MARTIN, YOUR SON. ALL RIGHT? SO WE'RE GONNA GO. I HAVE TO RETIE MY-- WHERE ARE MY GLASSES? DID I BREAK 'EM? I DON'T KNOW. YOU THREW THEM AT ME. WHERE DOES HE LIVE? IT'S THE SAME ADDRESS, BEN. WE'RE ON ELM STREET. IT'S UP THERE. THERE. MILLIE. THEY'RE HERE. CAN YOU GO UPSTAIRS AND ASK MARTIN TO COME DOWN? WHAT? WHAT? WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS. WE'VE COME TO AN AGREEMENT. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT FOR WHO? THERE'S A DOZEN EXCUSES. WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS. SAY THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW. SAY THAT WE CHANGED OUR MIND. STOP IT. STOP IT! OKAY? MARTIN! (EXHALES) ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST BE YOURSELF. JUST BE LULU. YUP. I CAN DO THAT... I GUESS. ARE YOU READY? ARE YOU READY? TAKE YOUR GLASSES OFF. OKAY. DOES ANYONE WANT TO RING THE BELL? THE BELL? BEN, THE DOORBELL. OH. (BELL CHIMES) HI. I'M MARTIN. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) HI. BEN. YOUR FATHER. LULU. YOUR MOTHER. NICE TO MEET YOU. THIS IS CLAIRE, BEN'S WIFE. OH, THE SHRINK; RIGHT? YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. THANK YOU. YEAH. CONGRATULATIONS. 16. IT'S A BIG ONE. A BIG ONE? WELL, YOU GET TO DRIVE AND ALL. I'VE BEEN DRIVING SINCE I WAS 14. OH, I DIDN'T KNOW. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME. YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T. BUT HE WANTS TO. WE WANT TO. SORRY. I-- I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE FRIENDLY. NICE TRY. WELL, UM, COME IN. I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE SHORT NOTICE... MOM, DAD, THIS IS LULU. HELLO. NICE TO MEET YOU. HI. HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. AND THIS-- CLAIRE. SORRY. OH, THAT'S OKAY. I THINK WE'RE ALL PRETTY NERVOUS RIGHT NOW. NO KIDDING. BOY, OUT THERE MY HEART WAS POUNDING SO FAST I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA POP. IT WAS GOING BOOM-BOOM BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM, YOU KNOW, LIKE I WAS ON DEATH ROW OR SOMETHING. BUT NOW THAT MARTIN LET US IN, I FEEL MUCH BETTER. I MEAN, I MAY NOT SOUND LIKE I FEEL BETTER, BUT IT IS BETTER; NO? I KNOW I TALK REALLY FAST. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SO HANDSOME. DON'T. SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY IT. THAT'S OKAY. YOU WERE JUST TRYING TO BE AFFECTIONATE. MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T RUSH THINGS. I WASN'T TRYING TO. WHY DON'T, UM-- WHY DON'T WE SIT DOWN? IT'S A LOVELY HOME. THANK YOU. COULD I GET ANYONE SOME ICED TEA OR A LEMONADE? OH, MAN, I COULD USE A GLASS OF WHITE WINE. WE DON'T SERVE ALCOHOL. I'M SORRY. OH, ICED TEA WOULD BE GREAT. TEA'S FINE. YOU DON'T SERVE ALCOHOL? NEITHER ONE OF US DRINKS. OH. ARE YOU ALCOHOLICS? NO. YES. YES. I'M AN ALCOHOLIC. WOW. I USED TO DRINK A LOT WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, BUT I WAS NEVER THAT BAD. A LOT OF MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE HAVE ALCOHOL IN THEIR-- MY MOM IS NOT MENTALLY ILL. I WASN'T SAYING-- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT. CLAIRE SAID THAT YOU WRITE FOR TELEVISION. YOU DID IT AGAIN. YOU INTERRUPTED ME. DID I? TWICE. I'M SORRY. NO, YOU'RE NOT. I MEAN, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FINISH ONE SENTENCE-- HE SAID HE WAS SORRY. SO NOW YOU'RE ON HIS SIDE. WELL, I GUESS THAT YOU WOULD BE BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR HOUSE AND YOU LIVE TOGETHER... (DOORBELL CHIMES) I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. HEY, BREATHE. (EXHALES) (GIRL) SORRY I'M LATE. HEY, MRS. ELSWORTH, MR. ELSWORTH. THIS IS LAYLA. HI. I'M HIS GIRLFRIEND. BEN. HI, NICE TO MEET YOU? LULU. HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. YOU WRITE FOR "MAGNETIC NORTH"? THAT'S A REALLY COOL SHOW. BEN WAS ACTUALLY NOMINATED FOR AN EMMY TWICE. LOST BOTH TIMES, BUT... UM, MARTIN WRITES. POETRY, ACTUALLY. HE WRITES POETRY. REALLY? I'D LOVE TO READ SOME OF IT. WHY? OH, NO. YOU SHOULD SHOW HIM. HE HAD SOME PUBLISHED IN OUR-- JUST DROP IT. OKAY? I'D LOVE TO SEE YOUR WRITING. BEN I KNOW WOULD, TOO. I'D RATHER NOT. WHY ARE YOU SO NEGATIVE? CAN'T YOU BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OPEN, A LITTLE BIT? MARTIN'S EXTREMELY OPEN. HE BARELY KNOWS YOU OR BEN. I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS HE WOULD RATHER KEEP TO HIMSELF. WELL, THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE. WE ALL CAN RELATE TO THAT, AHEM. CAN'T WE, BEN? WELL, I... I COULD RELATE A LOT MORE IF YOU COULD FIND A WAY TO LIGHTEN UP JUST A LITTLE BIT. I WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE UNDERSTANDING CONSIDERING YOU'RE THE ONE THAT PUT HIM IN THIS SITUATION. MILLIE. CAN MARTIN NOT SPEAK FOR HIMSELF? YOU CAN, CAN'T YOU? ALL WE DID WAS ASK TO SEE SOME OF YOUR WRITING. BEN IS A WRITER, TOO. YES. YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THE WRITING. WE'VE COME TO SEE YOU, TO TRY TO GET TO KNOW YOU, MAYBE LEARN TO LIKE US. WELL, I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO COME BACK. I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO COME BACK INTO MY LIFE, DID I? NO. DID I, BEN? NO, MARTIN, YOU DIDN'T. BUT LET'S FACE IT, YOU WOULDN'T BE ON THIS PLANET IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME AND LULU. WHAT? IT'S A FACT. SO NOW AFTER 16 YEARS YOU'RE GONNA COME BACK AND WANT TO TAKE CREDIT? MAN, THAT'S BULLSHIT! IF I EVER HAVE A KID, I'M NOT JUST GONNA BLOW OFF ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND JUST LEAVE IT. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NOT A THING WE CAN DO OR SAY THAT IS NOT GONNA SET YOU OFF, IS THERE? ALL THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO COME HERE AND MEET THEIR SON. ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'M NOT IT. OKAY? YOU'RE NOT MY DAD. HE'S MY DAD, AND SHE'S MY MOM, AND SHE'S JUST CRAZY. THAT IS NOT FAIR, MARTIN. WHAT? I MEAN, LOOK AT HER. NO! HE IS RIGHT. THEY GIVE US ONE NIGHT'S NOTICE AFTER 16 YEARS. HOW DID YOU THINK THAT HE WAS GONNA REACT? DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT AT ALL? WHY DO WE LET THEM DO THAT? OKAY. THAT'S ENOUGH! THAT'S ENOUGH! YOU KNOW WHAT? NONE OF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN GIVING US A CHANCE HERE, HUH? WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT THIS HAS GOT TO BE FOR YOU, BUT IT'S HARD FOR US, TOO, OKAY?! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THIS WOMAN HAS GONE THROUGH, THE COURAGE IT TOOK FOR HER TO GET HERE OVER 2,000 MILES? SHE WAS BRINGING ALL THE LOVE SHE HAS TO YOU, KNOWING THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GIVE IT BACK RIGHT AWAY. I THINK YOU OWE HER AN APOLOGY. YOU FIND HER? NO. SHE'S-- SHE'S GONE. CLAIRE, LET'S GO! I'M SORRY. MARTIN'S REALLY A WONDERFUL KID. GIVE IT SOME TIME, YOU'LL LEARN THAT. OH, GOD. WHERE COULD SHE BE? I THINK I KNOW WHERE SHE IS. SO LET'S GO. WAIT. I'D LIKE TO COME WITH YOU. LET'S GO. HEY, UM, CAN I GO IN ALONE? MARTIN... IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT. OKAY. ♪ (MUSIC PLAYING) WHY DID YOU DO THAT? WHY DID YOU DO THAT? I WANTED TO SEE WHAT KIND OF DAY IT IS. A DAY LIKE ANY OTHER. GIVE ME A DRINK. WHAT TIME IS IT? 11 O'CLOCK. I'LL BE BACK LATER. WHY? WHY? LISTEN. I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAID EARLIER. YOU KNOW, I-- I DIDN'T MEAN IT. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT CRAZY. OH, YEAH, I AM. I ACCEPT IT, YOU KNOW. YOU SHOULD, TOO. IT MAKES THINGS A LOT EASIER. (FILM PLAYING IN BACKGROUND) WHAT'D YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT FOR, SARAH? HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME WAS SARAH? YOU TOLD ME. (IN UNISON WITH FILM) I LIED. WHEN I'M DRINK, I LIE. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN THIS? A LOT. A LOT. IT WAS BEN'S FAVORITE FIRST, AND THEN IT WAS MINE. WE HAD A LOT OF FUN TOGETHER, ME AND BEN. WE HAD BIG FUN. FOR A WHILE WE WERE SO CLOSE THERE, WE SHARED ONE HEART. BEN WOULD HAVE MADE A TERRIFIC DAD, DON'T YOU THINK? I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW? MAYBE. MARTIN, HE NEVER KNEW THAT I HAD A BABY. I NEVER TOLD HIM UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO. LOOK, EDDIE. (IN UNISON) I GOT TROUBLES, EDDIE. YOU THINK YOU GOT TROUBLES? IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE DIDN'T SEE EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE. YOU KNOW, I COULD NEVER EVER HAVE RAISED YOU, YOU KNOW? I WAS TOO SICK. YEAH. BUT I KNEW THAT ONE DAY WE WOULD SEE EACH OTHER. I KNEW THAT FOR SURE. I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU CAME. YOU ARE? YEAH. I AM. SORRY. Shh. Please be quiet while the movie's playing. OKAY. IS THAT WHAT MAKES A WINNER? WHAT ELSE CAN? YOU GUYS OKAY? YEAH.
