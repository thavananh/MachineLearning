foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- [siren wailing] [low rumbling sound] Oh Jesus no. [rumble] Jen! Jen! Wake up! Jen. [coughs] Where are we? We're in the safety room. The emergency system is kicking in. -We need to stop it. -Where's Simmons? I don't know, why? He's got the override codes, that's why. You have to find him. [coughs] He's over here, Jen. Malcolm! I think he's hurt. Malcolm! Malcolm! Malcolm! Can you hear me? He's not responding. How long do we have? Less than twenty seconds! See if you can find anything on him that has his code. I can't find his access passes! [computer] Exposure protocols in effect. [Cooper] He's out cold. He's taken a blow to the head. We gotta get him outta here! [electrifying music] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music intensifies] [sighs] Good afternoon, my name is Dr. Franklin. Some of you will know me, but many of you will not. In 24 hours I begin an adventure that for me has been years in the making and for all of you could possibly lead to the most exciting work and discoveries of your professional lives. It's a journey that will take me from the comforts of my office and home here in New York City to one of the harshest and most challenging environments known to man, the South Pole. Now my goal and the goal of everyone involved on my team will be to drill deep into nearby Lake Vostok. It's our deep and sincere belief that when we breach the ice that has stood for hundreds and thousands of years there, we'll discover something truly remarkable. A lake, a lake isolated from the rest of the world for perhaps millions of years, and it's there despite the incredibly harsh conditions that we hope to discover forms of life that are totally unique. These new forms can offer us a totally new perspective of how life on Earth was formed, and beyond that it opens up the possibility of similar life on other worlds as the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn. This will be one of the most challenging expeditions of my life, but thanks to the support of everyone at Hyperion and my dear friend Dr. Simmons, it's one that I'll relish. So, to quote the indomitable explorer Jacques Cousteau, "The impossible missions are the only ones that succeed". After my arrival I'll be sharing our progress regularly with you through this corporate web log. But until then, god speed. [static] We're not going anywhere unless he wakes up. If we don't get out of here in the next seventy minutes, -then... -Then what? Then the room is filled with napalm and ignited. Anything and everyone down to the microscopic level -is going to be incinerated. -Christ. It'll be OK, we'll get out, we just need to wake him up. Look everywhere, find a survival crate. There should be a med kit inside. OK. [screams] Oh God! -[Harding] Are you OK? -[Cooper] Yeah. [groans and sighs] [Cooper] Found something. There's a lamp. There's water. There's bandages. [creepy noise] Shit! [Harding] What is that? [Cooper] I don't know. [Cooper] Jen, what are you doing? [Harding] Trying to get some answers. [Cooper] Jesus, Jen. Is that a gunshot wound? [Harding] I don't know. [Harding] Here, hold this. We gotta found out how he got like this. [Harding] Above the wound. [suspenseful sound] [Harding] Hold on! Don't shoot! [Cooper] Shit! [Carter] Who are you? [Harding] I'm Dr Harding. This is Dr Cooper. You're in a safe room, you've been shot. I've patched you up as best I can, but we're gonna need some help. We need to find out what happened. Do you know what happened? [suspenseful music] [Carter] It's hazy. I think I passed out. Do you have water? I'll go get you some. [Carter groans] Who's that? That's Simmons. We found him like that. -Is he... -No, no. He's just unconscious. Looks like he took a pretty bad blow to the head, he's OK for now. -OK. -Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey! [Carter] What? You gotta stay still, you can't go anywhere. I won't be OK for long, and neither will your friend over there. [low eerie music] What? What am I missing? [low eerie music] We can't get out. What do you mean? Just open the door. -[Cooper] Can't open the door. -Why? I'm going to find the light. The room's in lock down. Containment protocol. When the room is entered and the door is closed, the occupants have five minutes to enter the required all clear codes. No codes are entered in, containment protocol kicks in. We have seventy minutes to enter the override codes. OK, so you've got the code, right? The code to get out? Yeah I've got a code, but that's not enough. Two independent codes have to be entered in order for the override to work. OK so you've got the other one? [Carter] Ah, you've gotta be shitting me man. We're locked in this room and the only person who can help us is knocked out on the goddamn door! What happens when the countdown reaches zero? You don't want to know. I think I do Doc. If the countdown reaches zero before any code is entered, the system will either think the occupants are hostile, incapacitated or contaminated Then what happens? Then the room is filled with pure oxygen and napalm is detonated. Anything and everything left in this room will be vaporized. Jesus! I'm not sticking around for that. I didn't sign up for this. There's no way I'm staying around to get lit up like a BBQ! [Harding] There might be another option. When I first started Malcolm, Dr Simmons, said that if an override code was entered externally, then any countdown could be stopped. But, there's a but right? But that's only possible if there's someone on the outside to enter the code. If there's no one there then... Back to the old BBQ. Sorry, probably not a good time for jokes. Dammit, no signal. Hey, any of you guys got a cell on you? No. No cells phones in the lab. Left mine in the locker. Before all this started. It won't matter anyway. This room is under meters of concrete and surrounded by steel. Built to withstand a bomb, but a bitch to make a call. [Carter] What? What is it Harding? Harding, what is it? What's up? What is it Jen? What have you got? [Harding] Oh, please be in here. Is that what I think it is! I can't believe I forgot about this. There should be a port in one of these walls. Take that cord and plug it into it. [Harding] Did you find it Cooper? [Cooper] Yeah sort of. Not much cable though. Got it. Let's hope this works. [Carter] Hope what works? VPN. VP what? [both] Virtual Personal Network! Simmons had it installed about a month ago. I can't get an external connection from in here. But I can connect to my workstation which is connected to the internal network. From there I should be able to access anyone who's out there on that same network. Get us some answers. [Cooper] Get help too. Outstanding. [Harding] Thank Simmons. When that man wakes up and we get out of here, I'm giving him a big kiss. Me too. Well, maybe not a kiss, but definitely a beer! [Harding laughs] Safe room occupied, four occupants, two wounded. Containment protocol initiated, countdown in effect, 55 minutes remaining. Need urgent evac. Respond ASAP. [Harding] There. [sighs] [Harding] Someone will respond We hope. Sit tight Robert, you've got to be patient. I'd be a little more patient if that timer wasn't counting down every damn second. [groans] [static] Well, here I am. Albeit, several days behind schedule. But since leaving New York we've traveled over 9000 miles via two continents to get here. After a few weeks of fights and trains and cars it's simply just a relief to stop and it'll be really nice to sleep in the same bed for more than one night. The journey for the team really was planned perfectly down to the smallest detail. If it wasn't for the sudden shift in the snow front we'd have been here exactly as detailed in the itinerary. Scheduling has been fantastic, technology wise the level of technology here is far surpassing anything previous expeditions have had. Some of the most comfortable living quarters I think I've ever seen, so... the team and I are really going to settle in quickly which is great. It's easy to forget just where we are. We're on one of the most isolated and inhospitable places on the Earth. We'll be setting up the drill site in about 48 hours weather permitting. Before that, I'll set up the lab with Dr Phillips. Really there's a long way to go before we do the work we've come here to do. But all of us are so excited to get started. I've not felt this way in years and I'm really looking forward to sharing it with you guys, so until then, wish us luck. [static] We need to stay busy until someone responds. Help me move Malcolm. Do you think we should? Jen, that's not such a good idea. He's not looking so good. You know we don't know how long it's going to be until help gets here. By the time they come we could have seconds to get out of this place. The closer Malcolm is to the door, the better off we'll be. No, Jen, just leave him there. If he's our last option, I would just rather wait until then and we can try anything else. Just leave him, I don't want to hurt him. He's not our last option! Well what do you suggest we do? What do you want me to do? I will do anything, just leave him. For me! I'll do anything! Hey! [groans] Have some of this. Son of a bitch man. [sighs] How you doing? I've been better. The pain's getting worse. [sighs] Hang in there. We're going to get you out of here soon. -Get you all fixed up, OK. -[groans] You think he'll be OK? He's breathing. So, for now that's enough. Alright you know what, I'm going to change the dressing on your wound. Keep it as clean as possible until someone comes. [Carter] You're the doctor. No, not that kind of doctor, right? This might hurt. Alright. [Carter groans] [Harding] It's alright, you're doing great. [groans] Shit. Pretty soon we are going to be out of here. [groans] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Okay, one, two... [Carter] Argh, you didn't say three! Fuck! I've never been shot before. [groans] It's alright. [Carter] I didn't expect this. It was supposed to be an easy assignment. [Harding] Hold on, hold on, we're almost there. We're almost there. [Carter] That looks better. Here we go. Good job. [alarm beeps] [alarm beeps] -[Cooper] What is it? -[Harding] Oh my god. [Carter] What? [Cooper] Answer it! [beeping] Hello? -Hello? -[phone] Who is this? Er, this is Dr Harding. Dr Jennifer Harding. [phone] Who is with you? Can I ask who this is? Are you from the police or the FBI? Do you know what's happened? Hello? Ma'am, who else is with you? I'm here with my colleagues Dr. Robert Cooper and Dr. Malcolm Simmons. There's also a soldier here, a Corporal Carter. Dr Simmons and Carter are injured, they need urgent medical assistance. OK. My name is Mr Lang. I'm from the Department of Homeland Security. We got your message. Are anymore of you hurt? No, Dr Cooper and I are unharmed. We woke up here in the safe room. We don't know how we got here. Do you know what happened? Good. What is the status of your injured? The corporal has a gunshot wound in his left leg. I treated it as best that I could, and Dr. Simmons, he's unconscious. He seems to have sustained some kind of blow to the head. They both need urgent medical assistance. Has Dr Simmons regained consciousness at any stage? No. Why does that... Just wanted to check. So I'm clear with the situation. We're not clear with the situation. We're stuck here in a safe room with no way to get out, unless you help us. We don't have a lot of time left so what's going on? I'm here to help you, doctor. I'm sure you appreciate that we have to assess the situation before we respond. What is the situation you need to assess? Hello? Mr Lang? Yes. I'm here. I will brief you on the situation as it stands. I ask that you do not interrupt me in any way until I have finished. Agreed? Of course. Agreed. Earlier this morning, there were three car bombings in Central Manhattan. All within minutes of each other and all targeting civilian locations. However, we believe this was a diversion for other targets. The primary target being the facility in which you work. It was attacked in force and it appears the terrorists had access to the facility targeted specific materials to take. There was a firefight at the facility as the terrorists tried to leave. During the fight it appears the material they were trying to take was compromised. As a result, the facility has been secured to assess the risk of outside contamination. Well, what about us? Are we contaminated? We don't know. We are assessing that now. What material was released? We don't know. We're... Let me guess. Assessing the situation. Mr. Lang we don't have a lot of time. Dammit. We understand your situation, doctor. Rest assured, once we know more about the potential level of contamination we'll have a team come to you. I'm sure someone with your experience can understand that. Yeah, I understand. Good. We will make contact again shortly. [beep] [static] It has been such an exciting morning! I've traveled to the drill site to view the drilling platform and see for myself the fantastic work that's been done by Vitaly and his team. They have taken great measures to ensure the drill bits aren't freezing as we drill deeper into the bore hole. To prevent freezing and closing an Eco neutral fluid has been poured into the bore hole. This should prevent bacterial or any other contamination as we near the breakthrough depth. The team, myself included, we want to make sure this time, effort and money isn't wasted by leaving things like that to chance. The risk of contamination is just too awful to contemplate. I'm making sure I cross my fingers as much as I can, just hoping for the best at this point. But in the meantime I'm going back to the drill site with Dr Phillips to observe the very first drive into the ice layer. So, wish us luck. [static] Jesus! Get me outta here! Get me out! Open! Get me out of here please! Open the door! God dammit! [panting] It's okay Robert. We're going to be okay. I wish everyone shared your confidence, Jen. You heard what that guy Lang said. We just need to sit tight and they'll be coming to get us. You know what though, I can't believe a bunch of sand rats actually found this place. I didn't even know this place existed until I got hauled in on assignment. Sand rats? Yeah, sand rats! Al Qaeda! Muslim extremists, whatever you want to call them. Look we don't know who's responsible for this, and until we know, keep all that to yourself. Keep what to myself? The facts Doc!? Are you really trying to keep things PC in here right now. Shit Doc! All I'm saying is until we know what happened and who's involved that there's no need to stir ourselves up. We need to focus on being ready to get out of here. He's got a point though Jen. Robert, please! Just hear me out Jen, listen. You're right Carter, what you're saying is right. Not how you say it, but what you're saying. Well fuck you too Doc. No, you're right Carter, just listen. How do these terrorists or extremists or however you want to label them, get into this place. I mean it's not like we have a sign on the front door that says, come in! The company made sure this place was totally covert, meaning there's no board intrusion, no congressional meddling. I thought this was a military facility? Well, yes, in a sense, yes. The work's primarily for the military, but it's privately funded. There's no money in government for places like this! That's how the military likes it. Meaning there's no budget questions, there's no pressure. What's your point Robert? My point Jen, is that there's only two ways for these terrorists to get into this place. They either hijacked the company database, or they got someone to give it up. Are you saying this is an inside job? We don't know. We don't know who the hell was on the end of that call. How do we know that Lang from Homeland Security even exists. Oh, if it's not Lang who the hell do you think it is? We don't know! That's my point! We're stuck in here and we have no idea what the hell is going on out there. Come on man, you're not serious man. Come on. Of course I'm serious. What is it you think we do here? What? What does this facility do, what's its function? Er, storage. You store chemical weapons before they're shipped off for use or disposal. That's part of what we do, yes. -[Carter] Part? - Robert. What are you doing? It's OK Jen. He needs to know. -[Carter] What!? -[Harding] No he doesn't. [Carter] What are you guys talking about? [Carter] What! [Harding] Robert, don't We create viruses. You create viruses? Why? How? The why is easy, the how is not. Then start with the why. You've heard of the nuclear deterrent, right? Well, it's quickly becoming clear it's not much of a deterrent anymore. Why? Two reasons. Costs too much to maintain, and it's not a clean weapon. Look back in the day of the Cold War, the biggest fear was nuclear and we could hold our hand over the doomsday button, and keep our enemies at bay. Now the biggest fear is the bottom line, and having a weapon they'll leave the country we want to attack uninhabitable for a few hundred years. It's all about the damn bean counters? Of course! Ha, do you think we can really afford all the equipment, the men, the time to manage a nuclear arsenal. To put it simply the world can't afford a World War Three! But what it can afford and what we're spending billions trying to create is a weapon so sophisticated it's as smart as it is deadly. Viruses. [laughs] Not just any viruses. Viruses that are designed, viruses that are targeted. The corporation has given us the freedom to create something with infinite possibilities. To allow us to truly protect our country, to strike fear in those who want to do us harm. God! Robert! You're starting to sound like the suits at headquarters. This isn't about creating a weapon, this is about developing the understanding to control and manipulate the organisms that are the very building blocks of humanity. The weapon is just a starting place. It's a way to fund our work. [Carter] Well Doc, looks like someone else wants in on your work. Yeah. Looks that way. [static] I need to request more security for the station. The drill site was attacked this afternoon by some damn activists. They tried to destroy the generator for the drill. Two of Vitaly's team luckily came across them, a fight ensued. Thank god no one was hurt, just some cuts and bruises. The activists are now in custody and Bob from security has called for a transport so we can get them sent to the authorities. [static] We were lucky. Who knows what they could have done. They were both crazy, screaming about the lake, and what's down there and what needs to be kept down there. I spent too much time preparing for this to let some lunatics wreak it. I've asked for Bob to submit a request to headquarters for another security team, I'll do the same. The team needs to be protected in order to be able to work in peace. [static] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Mr Lang? Yes, it's me Dr. Harding. How are you doing? Er, we're as fine as we can be, Mr. Lang. Good. That's good. Any news on the situation outside? Yes, there have been some developments since we last spoke. We're all ears, Mr Lang. Yes, sorry. Our initial reports have been confirmed. This was indeed a terrorist attack. We believe them to have been an extremist group sympathetic to Al Qaeda. It appears the car bombs were indeed a smokescreen, a distraction for the real target. Your facility. At this stage we believe at least twelve terrorists were part of the attack on the facility, nine were killed in the ensuing gunfight. The other three are being hunted right now. What did they get? What materials are compromised? That is still to be determined, doctor. We have teams working in the facility now. We are working to get you as quickly as possible, Dr. Harding. Do you understand? Yes, I understand perfectly. We'll be ready when you come for us. Good. I'll be in contact soon. [beep] [radio static] You know I'm sorry. I just can't believe that this could all be over. The drill is taking far longer than planned and at this rate, the team would need to work 24 hours a day straight for a month just to ensure that we stay on track. At best we're drilling a meter a day. A meter. If the company just wants to replace me, then they should just come out and say it. I mean I asked for a security team and what I got instead was an inspection team. This guy Lang from headquarters, what right does he have to question my methods? Did the board believe I'm not the right person for the job? If I'd known the company was going to send me a babysitter, I'd never would have taken this assignment. The sooner he leaves, the better this project will be. We all understand the investment the company has put into this, we don't need it shoved down our throats. I'm getting a bad feeling about all this. You heard what that guy Lang said, they just need to check some things out and they'll be coming to get us. And you believe that? They're not going to come down here and rescue us. -Who would know? -Are families would know, man. How do you think they'll explain all of us dying down here? It doesn't matter, it's the government, man. They can say and do what they want, plus the company has billions in compensation that they could just dish out. You're losing it man, you need to get your head on straight. My head's on fine, thank you very much. Maybe you better snap out of all hat army brainwashing. Brainwashing... What the fuck did you just say? You heard me Captain America. Just stay down. When it comes to situations like this, we mean shit! [Carter groans] I'm tired of listening to this bullshit. [Robert] What, cause it's the truth? You wouldn't know the truth if it slapped you in the face. -Fuck you! -[Robert grunts and moans] [Robert screams] [Carter] Fuck you man! I'm tired of you throwing your fucking bullshit all day long! -Stop It! Stop it now! -[both men grunt and moan] Stop it! -[Jen] Stop it! -[Carter] whoa, whoa, whoa. She's got a gun! Whoa, whoa, whoa. -[Robert] Jen stop, please! -[Carter] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shut up Robert, just shut up. -Don't you dare move! -Relax, relax. [Jen] Don't you dare move. Robert, move away from him... Now. Robert, go over to the crate, look inside. Find anything you can to tie his hands with. -[Jen] If you move... -[Carter mumbles] one more time... I will shoot you. [Jen] Don't think I won't Carter. I've been trained to use a gun and I will use it. -Anything, Robert? -No, nothing. -[Jen] Search his pockets. -Jen, I really don't want -to do this anymore-- -[Jen] Just do it. [Robert] Sorry man. [dramatic music] [Jen] Tie him up. Tie his hands. [Carter] You're making a big mistake, Doc. We'll see about that, Corporal. [Carter] What are you going to do now, shoot my other leg? [static] All right, this is blog entry 170. [sighs] Yeah, is that all? Feels like more. Um, we're about 40 meters from the breakthrough depth. I guess since my last entry, it's been... It's taking us about three weeks to make another ten meters. The ice just seems to get more formidable with every meter we drill. Um, Vetalia and the rest of the drill team have worked around the clock to replace damaged drill heads. But I think now we've broken through the worst of it and we can push on. The team... are just tired. They're fed up and the cold is never ending here. We've really struggled ever since Lang and the others have arrived. And it feels like every move is being monitored. We're more like prisoners here than scientists. And we all want to finish the job but I don't think any of us is going to be having iced tea any time soon. The beauty of this place has long been forgotten. And it's barren, it's lifeless. I just hope that the blood, sweat and tears that have been spilled to breach this ice is worth it. You know, the treasures underneath that lake, they have to be worth it. The good news is we should breakthrough in about two days. So, hopefully I'll have a happier report then. [static] [breathing heavily] Jen, what do you know? -He's one of them. -[Robert] What? -He's one of the terrorists. -A terrorist? Him? You've gone nuts. Cooper untie me, your colleague's going nuts. Shut up, you son of a bitch. -You're not going anywhere. -Jen-- [Jen] Back off Robert... Unless you want to join Carter here. I think you got some explaining to do, Corporal. I don't need to explain shit! She's going bat shit crazy and you're going along for the ride. I'm just an unlucky asshole stuck in here with you. You seem to have forgotten I got shot saving your friend over there, huh? If I'm a terrorist, why would I do that? Ooh. [mocks laugh] Stumped the two geniuses, huh? We're not the only who think you're a terrorist. Seems like some people on the outside think so too. Who? Homeland. [scoffs] That guy Lang? You're going to hold me at gun point over a promise of a guy you've never even fucking met, man? You were happy to defend him just a few minutes ago. Yeah, that was before I had a gun to my face. You'll have a chance to speak to him soon enough, if... If you're innocent, you have nothing to worry about. [Carter] What makes you think we're getting out of here, huh? Take a look around, Harding. How much do we even really matter? What makes you think Lang, or whoever it was will be coming for us or be true to his word? [Carter] You have a family Doc? Huh? You've got a family? Anyone you might care about on the outside? Huh? Answer me, Doc! -Doc! -Yeah. I have a family. They mean a lot to you, huh? [Carter] I have a family too. Wife, two kids... you want to take them away from me? Lose my family, lose your family over a promise of a stranger? Don't talk about my family. Why? Your family means a lot to you? Well, mine means a lot to me too-- -Shut up! -[Carter] No! [Carter] You've called me a terrorist, you hold me at gun point and tied me up without any fucking proof! We're going to get killed out here and it will be your fault! You will never see your family again![unintelligible]. [Robert] Stop it! Stop it! [intense music] [Jen] I told you to shut up! I told you to shut up! [moans] -[Jen Whimpers]. -[Carter] Fuck! -It's ok Jane, it's ok. -[Jen sobs] It's ok, it's fine. [continues sobbing] [coughs] [Jen] I'm sorry Robert. [weepy voice] I just lost it. [exhales deeply] He's right, Cooper. We're stuck in here. Our families are out there, I-- I can't leave Sarah out there, she's been through so much. We'll get through it... We'll get through it and you'll be able to see your sister again, ok? You ok, dear? [mumbles] Bring me some water and a bandage. -Is he ok? -[Robert] He's fine. [static] Well, here it is. After 172 days in this lifeless place, we've finally found life. Now, this specimen has survived under 13,000 feet of ice for millions of years. Who knows what we can learn from it. What it can tell us about the world all that time ago. I mean, we've waited for months and months for this moment and now it's here. I just, I can't believe it. The team is going crazy. Lang actually seemed to smile since the first time I met him. You know, maybe the pain of the last few weeks has been worth it. I'm commencing testing tomorrow with Dr. Phillips. But for now... it is time to celebrate. [vile thuds] [exhales deeply] [static] [coughs] [VPN rings] Should I answer it? No, I'll get it. [ringing continues] [VPN beeps] -Mr. Lang? -[Mr.Lang] Yes Dr., It's me. Are you coming for us? They're having some complications. What complications? It appears that the teams on-site cannot confirm what materials have been released. They need more time to assess the risk before making any attempt to enter the facility. [Jen] Who's making these assessments Mr. Lang? Who are we waiting on? The teams don't say. The emergency response unit from the CDC. -Who's leading that unit?-Well I, um, I... don't have their names in front of me right now. You don't have their names Mr. Lang? What, on your desk? On your desk in Washington where you have no fucking idea what's going on? -Dr., I can assure you-- -No, you can't assure me cause you don't actually know what's going on. -I can assure you-- -No! You listen to me. I did as you said in your message Mr. Lang. I subdued the Corporal, he's ready for you to take. Wait, what? What message? [Jen] Enough. You know, we don't even know who you are. We're going to sort this out ourselves. -Wait! -What the hell are you doing? We need to be able to talk to them. No, Robert! But we're trapped in here and they're the only ones -who can let us out. -We can't rely on them. -We have to do this ourselves. -Well what do you propose we do? Malcom has a code. That's your suggestion? Malcolm is unconscious. Do you want to see your boys again? You know I do. Then we can't wait for help to come, we have to help ourselves. Malcolm has the code that can get us out. We have to wake him up. [static] [exhales deeply] Well, today has been a fascinating day so far. We've isolated the microbes from some of the water samples and I've been examining them with Dr. Philips. I mean their structure is absolutely astonishing. It appears that over time, they have evolved to withstand this harsh environment and they have more than survived. They've flourished. [static] I mean these microbes can really offer us real advances in modern genetics. Thankfully, we're going to break for a few hours Last night's celebration seems to be taking a toll on the team. No more champagne for me. Ever. [static] [softly] Ok. His pulse is steady, that's good. How do you suppose we bring him around? Let me guess... Med kit. [Robert sighs] [pants lightly] [groans] [low tone voice] Hey. Cooper. Grab the gun. You don't have to do this, man. You don't have to do it, grab the gun. Don't talk to him Robert. I'm not talking to you. Come on man, work with me. [Robert] Jen! Smelling salts! Smelling salts, try these. [panting] -[Robert moans] -[Jen] Turn him on his back. Do you really think these will work? [Robert] Well, we don't have much of a choice, do we? [Jen] Malcolm, please wake up. [gasps] -[moans] -[Robert] Hey, hey, hey, hey. -[Jen] Hey. Malcom. -[Robert] Hey bud. Hey, it's ok, it's ok. -[Jen] Hey. -[Robert] Breathe. My head. -[Jen] I'll get him some water. -[groans] [Robert] You all right? -[Malcolm] My head. -You're hurt, you're hurt. [Jen] You've been hurt, have some water. [moans] Help me up. [moans] [Robert] Help him up, come on. Take it easy. [Malcolm moans intensely] [Malcolm] Just get me over there. -[Robert] One, two, three. -[Malcolm groans loudly] [Jen gasps] [Malcolm moans] -[Jane exhales deeply] -[Malcolm] Finally. [groans] [Jen softly] Here. -[groans] -Hey, here. -[Jane exhales deeply] -[exhales deeply] [static] \N There will be no more updates today. Um, It looks like I have more than just a bad hangover. [inhales deeply] Some of the others are feeling pretty run down too. We think it might be food poisoning. I told the chef that sushi was a bad idea. But [inhales deeply] It's a little late for that now. Um... Dr. Philips seems to be ok. He's travelling with Lang back to headquarters today, so Simmons and his team can start a more thorough breakdown of the samples. [inhales deeply] [clears throat] Two weeks can not come fast-- [sighs] Dammit! [static] -[Malcolm groans] -The lab was attacked. Attacked? Yeah, we were told that is was by some kind of terrorist group. [exhales deeply] Told by who? By Homeland Security. They contact us through VPN but-- It doesn't matter. What's important right now Malcolm -is that we're in a safe room. -I can see that. [exhales deeply then moans] [exhales deeply] Jen and I found you here. We woke up in here. We found you before the containment protocol kicked in. [Malcolm exhales deeply] Then nobody has left the room, right? No, I... when we woke up the countdown had already started and I tried to disable it with my code but my code won't work. We tried to find yours too, but you were unconscious. Why would you need mine? To cancel the protocol, to get out. What the hell are you talking about? We can't leave this room. Why?... [louder] Why? Why Malcolm? [eerie music] Contaminated. [static] Uh, there's been an incident. Um... James are lab assistant attacked Vetalia. Um... He just beat him and beat him. By the time we pulled James off of him, Vetalia was unconscious. We got him locked up in the rec room right now and the Doctor's taking care of Vetalia as best he can. We're all just so tired, you know, I don't think any of us has the energy to deal with a bout of cabin fever like this right now. I think something is really wrong. [static] Malcolm... what happened? [exhales deeply] [exhales deeply] I can only tell you what I remember. I was in my lab... [inhales deeply] working on some test samples and I heard some gunfire coming from the outer room. I left my lab and I look down the hall and I saw some gunmen. They were shooting anybody... that they saw. I ran... And I heard some kind of ah, an explosion or something and a... all of the alarms... started going off. I got hit in the back of the head... by something or someone and I went down. Oh, wait. No someone... someone grabbed me. And they were dragging me down the hall. That's it, that's it, that's all I remember. Next thing you know, I was here. [moans] Is that him Malcolm? Is that who helped you? I don't know, maybe. -I-- -What about contamination? [Malcolm] What about it? The alarms were going off The only way the alarms will go off, is in the event that there is detected material. If the labs are compromised. But did you actually see anything? I didn't see anything specific. I just heard the gunfire and the fucking alarms. Well then how do you know we can't leave the safe room? All I know is protocol. If there's alarms, there's a breach. We go to the safe room. We've been contaminated! But I know what they were looking for. The gunmen? Yeah. Well what, Malcolm? [exhales deeply] This. This is... absolute power. It's the ultimate power... of life and death. [Jen] Malcolm, please. It's true. It's a... [exhales deeply] a virus so deadly, [exhaling] I mean... It makes Ebola look like a damn head cold. It's got no cure... Outside of... this antidote, that I have right here. What I have right here, this is barely enough to save... maybe 1000 people, maybe. But... this... There's enough in here... to kill three fourths of the entire population of planet Earth. [low eerie music] I don't know who those gunmen were. I don't know. But what I do know... is there is not a government... or terrorist network on the face of this planet... that doesn't want control of this. [inhales and exhales] That's just what the company wanted. I don't understand Malcolm. Where did these come from? I mean, I never heard anything about this. You weren't supposed to. You weren't authorized to. The company decides who knows what. This was classified, top secret. Well if it's classified, why are you telling us now? [Malcolm] Look around you, Jen. What do you think has happened? They don't want to stop this from getting into the hands of terrorists. They just don't want them to get it for nothing. It has to look like an accident. What are you saying Simmons? [exhales deeply] [eerie music continues] [Robert] Why would the company do that? [Malcolm] Who do you think we work for, Robert? They're a weapons manufacturing company, weapons! Not like guns and bombs and missiles, those are toys! What we work on is vastly more dangerous, infinitely more valuable. That's bullshit Malcolm. You've hit your head, -you're not thinking straight. -It's not bullshit. [Malcolm] We all created this together you just don't know it. Everything's been separated. You, you were working on isolating the molecular structure of small pox. That was your job. You were doing the same thing with Botulism. Team two was working on Bubonic plague and cholera. My job was to combine them all into a super virus which I accomplished two weeks ago. The E strain. The what? Extinction strain... extinction. [static] Killing each other... my team. People I've known for years. I mean, they're just turning on each other and I know it has something to do with those microbes. They're infectious somehow. Whatever it is, it's unlike anything we've ever seen before. I mean, it's just been surviving under the ice for millions of years waiting for us. You know in our rush to get down there and discover it... We unlocked something horrible and I don't think it was ever meant to be discovered. [coughs] [quietly] Jesus, it's... it's going to New York. I mean in a city like New York, it's going to spread. Listen, if you get this you have to destroy what we sent back. It was never meant to be discovered. [knocking on door] I've locked myself in here. [knocking continues] I've activated the emergency beacon. And I got enough food to last me for a couple days. [knocking continues] I just want to be home. I want to be home and I want to be warm. [static] [Robert] What do you think? What life and death is worth. [Malcolm] Its worth. What would you pay? This is billions, billions of dollars in my hand. It's priceless. The company doesn't care about us. All they care about is the product, that's it. And you think... if you can get out of here? You're going to be safe? Even if you're not contaminated... we know too much... we're too involved. Ah, no. There's only one logical thing to do, right now. What's that? [eerie music] We stay. Fuck you Simmons, we've got less than 20 minutes to get the hell out of here. You have the vials, you have the codes, so let's get the fuck out of here. [Malcolm] This isn't all there was. The other samples were still in the incubation chamber when the lab was hit! We're compromised! We're contaminated! So you're just going to sit there and wait for it to come to you? -Yes. -Jesus Christ! You fucking selfish prick! [Jen] Malcolm... do you understand what you're saying? I'll never see my sister again. Robert will never see his family. Carter... who saved you... Are you really willing to let that happen? I have family too. [Malcolm] I've let this go too far, it's gone too far. At least we can try... and make this right. Keep it contained. We got ourselves... to this point. We should have known better. I'm sorry... this is happening but we can't leave. I can't die in here. -What the hell are you doing? -[Jen] Tell me the code. I'm not telling you the code. I'm not-- Tell me the code! -I'm not tell-- -[shouting] Tell me the code! -Tell me the code! -Code! [shouting] Give me the codes, give me the codes! -Hey, hey-- -[Robert] Give me the codes! -Just-- -[Robert] Give me the codes! All right, Robert. -What are you going to do? -Give me the codes, give me the vials. You're going to kill me for it? [Robert] I know what you're trying to do. -I'm not trying to do anything. -[Robert] Stay there. I'm not trying to do anything, all right? You can make this choice for yourself but you can't make it for all of us. -[Jen] Give us the code. -Ok, I'll give you the codes. Just don't... don't shoot. I'll give it to you. I don't have it memorized, it's written down. Just wait, ok? -[Robert grunts] -[Jen] Stop it! [grunts and groans] -[Jen] Stop it, Malcolm please! -[Robert moans] Malcolm stop it! -[men groan] -[Jane] Stop it! -Stop it. -[groaning continues] [all grunting] [gunshot] [men groan] -Oh! -[Robert whimpering] -[Robert moaning intensely] -[Jen voice breaking] Robert. [Malcolm] I didn't mean to shoot him. [Robert moaning and panting] [Jen] Look what you did. -[Robert whimpering] -[Jeb sobbing] No, no. -[continues whimpering] -[Jen] Shh, shhh. [moans softly] No. It was an accident. [Malcolm] I was just... Look what you did. [crying and shouting] Look what you did! -Wait! It was an accident. -[Jen] Look what you did. -No, I didn't. -[Jen] Give me the code! [shouting] I can't. Give me the code Malcolm. [voice breaking] Give me the code. I can't. Give me the code Malcolm, give me the code. [gunshot] [Malcolm screams] -[Jen] Give me the code! -[Malcolm moaning intensely] [Jen] Give me the code Malcolm. [groaning intensely] If you don't give me the code, I swear I'll shoot again. [breathing heavily] I will make your last moments on this Earth as painful as possible. -[shouting] Give me the code! -I can't. [Jen] Yes you can! [sobbing] Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot me again. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. [moans] one, five, six, one, one, nine. [Jen] are you sure that's right? One, five, six, one, one, nine. [Malcolm] God. [panting] [suspenseful music] Hold it over the wound for what it's worth. [groans] You don't know what's out there. I'd rather take my chances out there than down in here. [control panel beeps] What are you doing? Leaving. Then take me with you. Don't leave me here to fucking die. [Carter] Hey! Please... Please, Harding take me with you. Thank you. [Carter] What? What are you doing? Why are you doing this Harding? Come on. -[Jen] I don't trust you. -[Carter] What? [Carter groans] Fuck. [beeping continues] [Carter] Harding I need you, I'm going to bleed to death. [door powers open] Harding, please I'm sorry. [alarm blaring] I'm sorry for what I said. Harding, don't leave me! Harding, please! Please Harding, I'll die here. [more alarms blaring] I'm sorry Robert. [doors power shut] [alarms continue blaring] [groans] [groans then screams] [continues groaning] [groans then screams] [both groaning and screaming] Doc. Don't do it Doc. I have kids. I'm a corporal of the U.S. Army. Nobody else is leaving. No one! [gunshot] [blaring continues] [groans] [screams] [panting] [moaning] [Jen panting] [dramatic music] [coughs softly] Hey, Sarah it's me, Jen. [coughing] I need you to call me back at this number when you get this, ok? I need to see you. I need, I need you to call me. [coughing] [sad music] Oh, God. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You got to stay away Sarah. You can't come home. You got to go fa... [alarms blaring] [moans] [moans] [groans] [VPN beeps] [sobbing] Oh God. [groans] [moans] [sobbing] [loud metallic pounding] [screams] [man] Hey lady. Are you all right? You ok? Hey, what happened to you? Are you ok? Babe, call 911. All right, all right. What happened? Babe, she has something in her hand-- Hi. We have a possible emergency here. [woman] There's something in her hand. There is a lady throwing up on the street with blood in her hands. Uh, no. It's something black. -Like a liquid. -[man] There's a black liquid in her hands. Excuse me, are you ok? [soft piano] [woman] Miss? [woman] Miss, can you hear me? [eerie music] [man] Don't touch her. [dramatic ending music] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
