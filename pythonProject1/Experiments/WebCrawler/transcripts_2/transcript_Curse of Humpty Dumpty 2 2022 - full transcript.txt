foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- - Girls girls, come on, wake up. Amelia. - Sorry, Miss. We were up all night Studying. - I'm sure you were. It's why you were specially selected for this trip. Your aptitude for studying. You're all so very good at studying. I'm glad you're paying attention. You are paying, aren't you, girls? Good, because it's time to give you the rules. At our school are important, but at our destination, they are sacrosanct. You are about to spend a week in a place with rules that will one day save the world. That's because it isn't just an ecological caravan park. It is a future Garden of Eden. Let's hope there's some snakes there. - Excuse me, Rebecca. - I just said like, I hope it's a nice break there. - You have been selected as the students most likely to benefit from the transformative environment provided by Green Cleanse. By the end of this week, your grades will be higher. Oh, your attitudes will be a lot sunnier. Oh, but my goodness, your skin will be much, much clearer. Green Cleanse changed my life. It will change yours too. But in order to have this life changing experience, you have to live according to the philosophy developed by the Green Cleanse community. - Philosophy? I thought we were going on a holiday, Miss. - Harrity. You are. You are taking a holiday away from your complicated lives, and to help you do this, here are the rules. Rule number one. No chargers. - Wait, what? How we supposed to charge our phone? - That brings me nicely to rule number two, no phones. Hand them over. You'll be begging me to bury them in the woods this time next week. - Miss, what if we need them? - Instagram is a want, not a need, Amelia. - No, what if there's an emergency? - Simply come to me. Just one more. Hurry up, Lisa. Excellent. Just two rules remain. You will consider the owner of Green Cleanse, Mr. Steven Brawn, my equal. As with I, whatever he utters is absolute gospel. Therefore, you'll do what he tells you to do. Do you understand? Say, "yes, Miss Harrity." Yes, Miss Harrity. - We have to do exactly what he says? Is he hot? Is he fit? Is he sexy? - He is a god. As for you girls, that is, do what he says and your lives will be transformed. Okay? - This is weird. - I dunno, it might be fun. I like ecological stuff. - Since when did Harrity and ecological go in the same sentence? - Wait, ma'am, ma'am? - Yes? - You said that there were two more rules. Obey Mr. Brown and what? - Obey Mr. Brawn. And no vehicles, we're going to walk the rest of the way. Get ready, get packed, meet me down in five. - I'm not walking. - Crystal. - It's Miss Harrity in front of the children, Steve. - Oh yes, and we must do everything properly, right? Girls. Welcome. You can call me Steve. You too, Crystal. I mean Miss Harrity. - Thanks, Steve. - Right, so girls, what do we make of heaven? Needs a bit of work, right? Well, that's where you come in. You are going to help us to polish this place into paradise. And in return, I'm going to enlist you on a mission to save the universe. Sound good? - Does that sound good? - Yeah. - Yes. - Yes, Miss Harrity. - I see why you insist on that, it has a nice ring to it. It's like music, it's beautiful. I know that you've had a long journey, so I will see if I can fetch Cody to help you with your things. Cody? Cody! Yes, Steve, - I want you to help the girls with their things and show 'em to their caravan. - Yes, Steve. - Good lad. At least I think he's a good lad. Sometimes it's hard to tell, right girls? - Yes, Steve. - You help this one first. Off you go. I'd follow him if I were you. Dinner's at six in the big tent. Big tent for a big event. - Here's your key. Take good care of it. - Thanks. - I mean it. We want to keep it locked. Especially at night. Lots of weirdos in a place like this. - Weirder than Steve? Don't think that's possible. - It's not just possible, it's probable. - Where's your caravan? - Over there, on the way. Okay, well, see you later, Amelia. - Salad, great. Where'd you get it? My parents left before. I love you, but you've been to my house for dinner, it cannot be worse than taco Tuesdays. No queue, where is everybody? - Steve and Crystal will be down soon. - Okay, sure, but where's everybody else? I thought this was meant to be a community. It doesn't feel very community-y. - There's a community all right. You'll join eventually. There, you should go back to your friends. - Come on, I need more than that. More please. Thanks. Okay, Cody is so weird. - Hasn't said a word to me. - Nor me. - Nor me. - Nor me. - Oh, I couldn't give a shit either way. - Wait, he didn't talk to you about the spare key? - The boy is flirting with you. - He was not flirting. - Maybe you've moved on from Bob pretty quickly. - You know what, I know you like quiet guys, but that's like actually. - Trying to forget about Bobby. Thanks for reminding me. - Well, try not flirting with every single decent guy here, then. - I wasn't flirting, I was just trying to get a fucking salad. - I saw him first. - You can have him. - Well, now that we're all here, I can give you the big speech. I will try and keep it brief, as I know that we have a very early start in the morning. But you will be working on a full stomach, thankfully. I hope you enjoyed your dinner tonight, and there'll be plenty more food in the morning, after you've had a bowel movement. You see, the more you excrete, the more we complete is a catch phrase that we have here at Green Cleanse. And you'll find that there's loads more of these catch phrases yet to come. Yes, Lisa. - What does that mean? What does what mean? - More we excrete, the more we complete. What does that mean? - We don't keep animals at Green Cleanse. We are a self-sufficient composter. Our toilet system runs directly into the growing zone so that we can spread your natural energies created by your bowels to harvest our crops. The more you shit, the more we eat. That's another one of our catch phrases that maybe explains it a little bit more succinctly. Right. Now that we've flushed that issue, we can move on. Tomorrow your new lives will begin. In exactly one week, Mayor Masterson will visit Green Cleanse. We want him to fund an expansion into our way of life in the local area. And we will succeed. And you will be part of that success. - Yes, we will. - Yes. - Yes, we will. - By furthering our mission, you are directly saving Mother Earth. By spreading the Green Cleanse ethos, you will be saving the planet. We will live in a world without cars, without phones. - Without phones? Without shit-free food? - Without fear. Without pain. With love. I am so proud of what we have achieved in our community. But we can do more. We can do better. We can be better. Do it for yourselves. Do it for us. Do it for your children and for our children's children, And for our children's children's children, and for our children's children's children's children. And... You get the point. The future is yet to be written, but we are the ones holding the pen. And the pen is mightier than the Ford. - This is like nonsense. - He did his own green cleanse before he came here. - I can see that you've had a long day. So I'm going to continue this speech in the morning. - Oh good, no more speeches, please. - But remember this, girls. Whatever I ask you to do tomorrow, there is always a reason. And you will be rewarded. - Yes, you will! - As will we. - Can we trade our rewards points for McDonald's? - I don't know about you, but I think that's a gift. - I know. - Oh, I forgot. - Bye. - Bye. So we're having this for breakfast? Guys, guys, guys. - Really good. - Yep. - Oh wait, no. - I need to use your wifi. Hello? If I was a wifi password, where would I be? Fuck it, let's go retro. Antony's Pizza, how can I help? - I'll have a large pepperoni, please. And I mean large, large enough to get me through the next few days without having to eat shitty lettuce. Hello? - What's your name? - It's Lisa. Where you calling from? - Creepy cabin in the middle of a place called Green Cleanse. I can meet you somewhere else. Hello? Hello? Hello? Serves me right for going analog. Ew. Fucking gross. At least my appetite's gone. - What's wrong? - Shit that smells bad. - Lot of things small bad here. This is the countryside, after all. Don't worry, you'll get used to it. Soon enough the entire world is going to be countryside. Mother Earth always wins in the end. - My fucking night. Jesus Christ. The showers here are painful. What the hell?! Fucking pervert! Where's my fucking bag? Phone. - No phones allowed. They're bad for the environment. - Humpty, this would be so much easier if you were vegetarian. - Sorry I'm late, Miss. - Well, now we're all finally here, we can begin. - What about Lisa? - Lisa? - Lisa? Our mate? - Oh, Lisa, yes. I think she must still be sleeping. I'll go- - No, Lisa probably left camp. This life isn't for everyone, right? - Wait, going home's an option? - It most certainly is not. And I'll be talking to Lena's parents when we get back. - Lena? - Lisa. - Lisa's parents? - Oh, stop being so insolent of me here. - Lisa is fine, I'm sure. I saw her last night and she was complaining of a smell, which is something that you girls are going to help us with today. - Excuse me? - Every day that you stay at Green Cleanse, you need to contribute to the community, and you will be rewarded. - What, you gonna give us like money or something? - Excuse me? Money? No, we don't believe in the capitalist system here. Obviously. No, here at Green Cleanse, we reward your kind actions with kinder actions. - So what do you want us to do, then? - You may have noticed that our caravans look a little bit grubby. So you are going to scrub them, inside, outside, top to bottom, in advance of Mayor Masterson's arrival. - Do I look like a cleaner to you? - No. Amelia, she is appropriately dressed. But luckily for the rest of you, the community have you covered. - Yeah. All right, girls. Chop, chop, get changed. - Oh, please. - Not wearing this shit. Do you think this goes with brunette? - I can't wear this. - Work to do. Off you go. - Come on. - I only wear black, you idiot. - Come on, girls, you can do it. Not much longer and we can all take a break. Yes. Come on, hurry up. - He's been taking a break since we got here. - Have you realized this is his caravan we're cleaning? - What a fucking joke! - You know, Lisa had the right idea going home. - Do you really think she left? Well, she's not here, is she? Don't see her leaving without saying goodbye. - Maybe she texted us. Harrity took our phones. - Oh yeah, she took it in with her, forgot. - That girl could smuggle a phone into prison. - I literally never saw her without it. - Fuck. - What? - If she's gone, that means we can't use it to home. - This is where we're taking our break? - Now, this is a natural progression between the work that you've done and the work that you're going to do. - What are you talking about? - Cleaned the caravan, now you're gonna clean the shower. Listen, girls, what we're gonna do is we're gonna have a big party in here when this is all over on your last day. - So we get a reward? This isn't it. - No, this is a treat, on your way to your reward. Come on. Off we go. - In you go. - For a hippie, this dude has capitalist ideology down to a fine art. - Calm down, Karl Marx. The workers of the world unite. All you've got to lose is your chains. The sooner we get this done, the sooner we can get our crappy reward. Get back to work. - Leave her alone, she's working as hard as she can. We all are. - Plus. - She's right. - Yeah, well, the only reward that I want is my bag and. - Oh, that's something you don't see often. - What? - A hoe carrying a pitch fork. - Oh my god. - No, no, no. - Guys! Guys, stop! - Stop it! No, don't. Told you to get back to work. - You've worked diligently today, girls. But there is still plenty more work to do tomorrow. And the next day. And the next day. - Steve? - But luckily, you have earned your first reward. - Then what is it? - Welcome to your first meditation moment. - So our reward is just standing in a field, then? No. You're going to be humming... And dancing. - And humming. Hum... Hum... Hum... Hum... Hum... - Fuck's sake. - Feel it, girls. Feel the energy run through your body. Feel Mother Earth coming up to your vagina and entering your body. She will be everything you need. Nothing else matters. The sun touches your lips... And resteth slowly on your nose. Her hands enter into your mouth... And down your throat... To the very pit of your stomach. We need nothing else... But love... And sky... And trees. And ferns. Remember this, girls. It will always be this way. Come on, why don't we have a quickie? No. I'm too pissed. - Come on. You know you want to. I said no. Right? I brought you all the booze you wanted. Get off me. Come on, you owe me. No. No. Don't be such a little fucking tease. No. - Good morning. Come on, hurry up. What we doing? - Cleaning Lisa's caravan. - Ugh, stinks. - Maybe that's why she left. - Lisa didn't leave. She's here somewhere, live tweeting from a cupboard. She's pranking us. - Do you really believe that? - Yeah. Lisa wouldn't leave without saying goodbye. - Plenty of people leave here without saying goodbye. - Like, when does everyone else get here? - It just us. - Just us for all this? - Your friends have their own caravans to clean. - Like this is gonna take two people more than a day. - Sooner you start, the sooner we're finished. - So what brought you to this place? - My parents. - Are they hippies? - You could say that. - Well, my parents are hippies. They'd probably love it here at Green Cleanse. Maybe I shouldn't invite them out, I could introduce you. - Don't. - Okay. I get it, you don't wanna meet my parents. - No, it's not that. This place, you shouldn't bring anyone here. - All eyes on me. - Hello, Steve. - You're making very slow progress, Amelia. - Getting there. - Are we? - We'll be done by the end of the day. - I hope so. Right, well, I think maybe our break is over now. - Yes, let's get on with it. - Stay on the path, Amelia. We'll save the planet. If you stay on the path. Stay on the path, boy. - Yes, Steve. - I'm gonna go check on the other girls and I hope that they have made more progress than the two of you. - That guy is so weird. Finally, we did it. - Almost. - What do you mean almost? It's completely clean. - The outside is clean. - We have to clean the inside as well? - We don't. You do. - Cody, all on my own? - Steve's idea. He thinks it would be respectful for you to clean it. 'Cause Lisa was your friend. - Is, Lisa is my friend. - Of course. - Look, I guess I'll come back tomorrow. - No, it has to be tonight. - Cody, I'm exhausted. It's been a long day and- - Steve's orders. - Fine. - What are you gonna do when I'm in there? - I'll wait right here. - Try and be quick. - Make sure it's spotless. This is where the mayor's going to be staying when he visits. Don't forget to clean the toilet. - Cody! - Come on. - Shh. Yes, it's me. Yeah, do you like that? Cody! Cody, I need to speak to you, this is... Cody, wait! - What the fuck do you think you're doing? You always ruin everything. I was literally this fucking close to finishing. - No, I didn't- - Now where the fuck has gone? Where's he gone? Cody. Cody! Where the fuck are you? You know, if you think you're gonna pump and dump me, you've got another thing fucking coming. And it's not gonna be you. They you are, you little prick. - Where have you been? I got something I need to show you. - Hello, girls. Mind if I sit with you? I need to talk to you. - So... What did you wanna talk to us about? - You said you need to talk to us, Miss? - Ah, yes, of course. Rebecca Harrington. She's been sent home. - What? - She was caught canoodling with a young man on the premises, Mr. Brawn and I thought it would be best she went home. We put her in a taxi and she's with her parents now. - Her parents are both dead. - It's a figure of speech. - Is it? - I'll leave you to your lunch. - It's breakfast. - Amelia, eat up. You'll need your strength for what comes next. Now Rebecca's gone, you're going to all have to do so much more. Good. - Lisa wasn't sent home. Rebecca didn't leave. - Amelia. - Look. I found this in Lisa's room under her bed. - Not in her hand? There's something definitely wrong. What the fuck is that? - I think I know. There, look. - Fuck. - Yeah, right, as in what the fuck? - What is it? - According to the book, a creature, an evil god known as Humpty Dumpty. - Let me reiterate, what the fuck? - Wait, as in the nursery rhyme character, the big egg? A lot of British nursery rhymes had roots in dark stuff. - Oh yeah, like "Ring Around the Rosie." - Exactly. Which came from an English plague. And this Humpty is a plague all right. - This is nuts. - Says he's a god who comes in the form of a doll. He grants wishes in exchange for a sacrifice. - What kind of sacrifice? - The innocent. - Won't find any of those here. - This was in the book when it was given to me. Thought it was a bookmark. Look. Kids are innocent. This woman was found with her kids. She'd murdered them and they found her with their bodies, ranting and raving about a Humpty doll. - This is proof. How do we stop it? - By closing the book and moving on with our lives? This is crazy. - It says that Humpty feeds on blood because it has a human heart. It means blood to give it power. - Like a fucking vampire? - Not quite, no. It's a god. But who knows? Maybe it also inspired the legend of the vampire. - Look, I asked how do we stop it? - Yeah. I was getting to that. It says that Humpty has a human heart, right? So destroy the heart, destroy the doll. - So just like a vampire. - Like I said, all stories come from somewhere. - Well, some stories are better than others. Do you guys seriously believe that some god-like Muppet is going around killing our friends? - I've got a different question. You're not gonna find the answer in there. - What's the question? - Humpty exchanges wishes for a sacrifice, right? - Right. - Who's killing our friends? - Sure he'll talk to us? - We'll make him. - What if he doesn't know anything? - He knows something. You've seen how weird he acts. What's wrong? - Everything. You girls have lost the plot. There is no killer doll running around this shit hole. - Sarah. - Don't Sarah me. Everyone's lost their fucking minds. Miss Harrity doesn't know where she is half the time, and you girls are treating Buffy the Vampire Slayer like it's some instructional video. Enough. - Something is going on. - Well, it can go on without me. Fuck all of this. Fuck you. Fuck you. Most of all, fuck Cody, fuck Miss Harrity, fuck Steve Brawn, fuck the Green Cleanse, and fuck Humpty Dumpty. Fuck all of it, fuck this, I'm out, mic drop, mother fucking peace. - Let her go. If she leaves, at least she'll be safe. - Bunch of fucking idiots. Oh, for fuck's sake. One of these has gotta work. Bingo. Guess we gotta do this the old fashioned way. Come on now. Cody! Cody! Cody! Cody! What you doing? We found something scary, look. Cody. Wow. - I'm sorry. What's going on here? - There's some creepy thing- - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. - Steve, you're hurting me. Steve. - Thank you for your sacrifice. You are the last three that I would expect to see standing here in front of me. Isla, Crystal always spoke so highly of you. - She did? - Why do you think she had trusted you to be keeper of the books? - Sorry, keeper of the what now? - And Amelia. You were supposed to be the best of us. - I was? - You were supposed to be cleaning, and there you were having an effin' orgy in the woods. - A what? - Hang on. What we did was- - And you. I don't want to hear a word out of your mouth. You know how important our mission is! I'm going to have to separate the three of you. In advance of Mayor Masterson's visit, I can't have you canoodling in the woods. - We weren't ca... - I am going to assign you each a cleaning duty. Alone. And I want you to learn... Not to let your genitals... Get in the way of saving the planet. - He's almost ready. - How do you know? - I can feel it? His power. He's saving my life. And when we have what we want. Destroy the creepy little thing. Eat its heart out of its chest. Take that power too. - We're not supposed to be together. If someone sees us and they- - Where is it? - What? - This thing. - I don't know what you're talking about. And when we have what we want. Destroy the creepy little thing. Eat its heart out of its chest. Take that power too. - How did you get that? You're not supposed to- - Supposed to what, Cody? - Run. - Not supposed to run? - No, run. Steve's coming. Come on. Here. - What is this place? - Someone used to work here. They don't anymore. It's mostly used for storage now. Your phone. Can I take a look at it? - It's not my phone, it's Lisa's. - Well, Lisa's phone, then. What do you wanna look at it for? - I just wanna see that picture again. - Look with your eyes, not your hands. - Look, I can help you. You just need to trust me. - What's going on, Cody? - Give me the phone. - Why did we run? - They need innocent blood. - Innocent blood? - Your blood. Are you okay now? Listen. I was going to try and smuggle you out of here before they could get to you. Look, I can't let you go with that phone. If they found out you had evidence, they'd never stop chasing you. Give me the phone, Amelia. Then I can get you out of here. - What about Isla? - She'll be fine. - Yeah, she'll be fine. 'Cause we're gonna find her and tell her everything. - That's a very bad idea, Amelia. - She's my best friend. I'm not just gonna abandon her. You can have the phone when we find Isla. - Okay. But let's wait until morning. He's strongest in the dark. We'll hide here tonight. Find her first thing. - Strongest in the dark? All the more reason to find Isla. - Don't you understand? He's not after her. He's after you. - I don't care! I'm going! - I know what I'm talking about. In here you're safe. Out there you're a danger for yourself and others. How will you feel if you lead Humpty to Isla? God forbid he kills her. No, we wait here until morning. - You promise she's gonna be okay? - I promise. - Isla, good, you're awake. I need you to come with me. - Why? - It's your friend, Amelia. She needs you. - Amelia, where is she? Steve? What's happening to Amelia? - Nothing. Welcome, Isla. - Hello, Isla. Welcome! - Cody? Fuck. Isla? Isla? Where's Isla? - Hello there. - Where's Isla? - Who's that? I don't know who you are talking about. - Stop playing games. - I like games. - Don't give me that crazy old lady routine. You're barely 60. - I'm 50. - Oh, so you remember that, do you? Isla. Oh, Isla. She went home. Said something about missing her laptops. That's all, that's all. Bullshit. - How dare you swear at me? Insolent child. Where is she? - I know where she is. You'll see her soon enough. Are you sure this time? We were informed that she would fit the criteria required by Humpty. - Hello, Amelia. - Fuck you. - We were informed she would fit the criteria required by Humpty. - Does she fit the specifications, Crystal? Crystal. - Oh, yes, that's me. What is it? - Does she fit the specifications or not? - Don't speak to her like that. You should know the absent mindedness is a side effect of a connection to Humpty. Her bad memory is a sign of her good faith. Quite right. - Only surprised you don't appear to be exhibiting any symptoms. Now, Crystal, is it? Does this Amelia fit the criteria? Is she an innocent? - Oh, she's untainted. It's the reason her boyfriend broke up with her. - Excellent. Should we inspect her, sir? Just to make sure? Just to make sure? - No, no, no need for that. We'll be seeing plenty of that later. - So, do we have a deal? Yes, yes. Give the paperwork to Mary. She'll do the rest. - Oh, you are not going to regret this. We are going to make the planet a better place. - Let's hope so. We're going to be living in it a very long time. No, no! Isla? Isla? Rebecca? - She knew the truth and she came willingly. - She knew the truth and she came willingly. - I'm so sorry, Amelia, I tried to warn you Or was it trick you. So easy to confuse the two. - Fuck you. Fuck all of you! - Language. - Fucking hypocrite bitch. All that shit about playing by the rules and you're gonna fucking murder me. - It's not murder, dear. - It's sacrifice. - Very different. But if you had paid attention to my history lessons, you would've already known that. - We sacrificed the smuggler, and then the whore, and then the betrayer, and then the keeper of the books. And now my son. - Our son. - What? - I'm sorry, Cody, but Humpty requires the death of the firstborn. - No, no. - And that's you. - We love you, baby. - Very much. - Dad? Dad? Mom! Mom? Amelia! - Cody! No, Cody! Cody! - Untie her. Let her say goodbye. She's not going anywhere. - Cody. - Maybe she did love him. More naive than I thought. All right, tie her back up. Now. All eyes on me. Now we come to the final sacrifice. The one that will let us live forever. The innocent. - The innocent. - The innocent. The one that came willingly. - Piss off, he fucking tricked me! - All hail Humpty. - All hail Humpty. - All hail Humpty. - Now, feed her the liquid of life. Soon he will be upon us, and he will take this innocence into his jaws. And as he feasts, so will we, on immortality. - All hail Humpty. - Everything I have done, I have done for him. We will create an eternal paradise for our immortal god. And we will join him in that paradise, and we will spend eternity protecting it. - So it is said, so it is done, for now and forever. - For now and forever. - For now and forever. - Look. He is upon us. - Fucking idiots. Read a book. He's a trickster god. Do you really think he's gonna give you what you want? - Let me go, please! All right, fuckers, you asked for it. Hey, Humpty Dumpty. Do you really wanna spend forever with this lot? Eternity with this bunch of hippies? Does that sound fun to you? Well, how about... You're a trickster god, right? How does it feel to be tricked? And when we have what we want. Destroy the creepy little thing. - You fucking bitch! - Uh... - Take that power too. - Honey. We just killed my firstborn child. Humpty has to grant our wish. Did you really think that your little tape would save you? - But you got what you want. Why do you need to kill me? - Your innocent blood ties Humpty to us further. Yes, he is a trickster god. But your death will make him more compliant. He'll be our slave. - He'll give us his heart on a plate if we ask him to. - You have to grant the wish of those that sacrifice their firstborn, right? - That's right. - Wasn't talking to you. Well, I already killed mine. Did it weeks ago. Kill them. Kill them all. No, no! - Amelia, show mercy. Show mercy, show mercy. - Fuck you! Have you killed them all? So you've granted my wish, then. Do I still have power over you? Fuck. Have a great fall. Oh, fuck. - I never did like eggs. What happened? - I don't remember.
