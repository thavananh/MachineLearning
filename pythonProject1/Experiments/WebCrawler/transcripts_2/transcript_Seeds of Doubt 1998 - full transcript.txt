THOU SHALT NOT BE VAIN. [BREATHING/GASPING] [SCREAMING] [WHIMPERING] NO, OH, PLEASE HURRY HELP! [SIREN WAILING] [SIREN WAILING] [FOOTSTEPS] [SCUFFLE] HEY, TAKE IT EASY. ALL RIGHT, YOU BASTARD. THE UNCLEAN SHALL RECEIVE THEIR JUDGMENT AT THE HANDS OF THE LORD. LET'S GO SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. MURDER THEM, THE HAPPY IGNORANCE DIVIDED ME FROM ALL THE VANITY, FROM ALL THE SLOTH, CARE, PAIN, AND SORROW. OH MY GOD. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [PHONE RINGING] MORNING LIEUTENANT DEXTER. TELL ME ABOUT IT. HIS NAME IS JOE BLY. THE KILLING'S IDENTICAL TO THE KOWALSKI MURDER. VICTIM'S NAME WAS SARA MCBAIN. SHE WAS 23 YEARS OLD AND SHE'S A MODEL. HOW'D HE DO IT? LIKE I SAID, DEX, IT'S THE SAME. SHE TIED, TIED HER TO THE BED. ONE CUT FROM THE BELLY UPWARD. HE GUTTED HER LIKE A FISH. WELL? WELL, WHY'D YOU CUT HER OPEN LIKE THAT? YOU REMEMBERED IT FROM THE PAPERS, DIDN'T YOU? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. I DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO YOU. I TALK TO GOD. YOU COPIED HIS STYLE. RETRIBUTION IS THE DIVINE WILL. C'MON, YOU KNEW SHE WAS A MODEL. SHE DESERVED IT. IT WAS THE LORD'S WAY. THE LORD... IS MY SHEPHERD. I SHALL NOT WANT. HE MAKETH ME TO LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES. HE LEADETH ME BESIDE THE STILL WATERS. HE RESTORETH MY SOUL. HE LEADETH ME IN THE PATH OF RIGHTEOUSNESS-- BULLSHIT. ... FOR HIS NAME SAKE. YEAH, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, I WILL FEAR NO EVIL. FOR THY ROD AND THY STAFF... THEY COMFORT ME. AMEN. [CAR HORN] JENNIFER. YEAH. JUST PRINTED. OH THEY'RE GREAT. UH-HUH. OH, I OWE YA. OH, HOW ABOUT DINNER? DON'T YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND, MIKE? NOT IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE. GET OUTTA HERE. [PHONE RINGING] MIKE HEARD THE CALL ON HIS SCANNER LAST NIGHT. HE SHOT THIS OUTSIDE THE STATION. GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOO. WELL, WHO'S THE PRETTY BOY. HIS NAME'S JOE BLY. MURDERED A LADY LAST NIGHT IN MAYFIELD. HERE'S THE ARREST REPORT. OH RIGHT, RIGHT. I HEARD ABOUT THIS ON THE RADIO. I'M DOING THE STORY AND I WANT PAGE ONE. WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU PAGE FIVE. THIS DESERVES PAGE ONE. NO OFFENSE, BUT WHAT'S ANOTHER MURDER? HE KILLED A MODEL. A MODEL? OKAY, PAGE THREE. A MODEL JUST LIKE LOIS KOWALSKI. NOW, I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT NAME FOR A WHILE. MY SOURCES SAYS THE M.O., THE WEAPON, EVERYTHING WAS THE SAME AS KOWALSKI KILLING. SO, IT'S A COPY CAT MURDER. HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. NOT FOUR YEARS AFTER THE ORIGINAL MURDER TOOK PLACE. WHAT IF THEY CONVICTED THE WRONG MAN, DAVID? RAYMOND CRAWFORD. OKAY, IN MY OFFICE. I THOUGHT THAT STORY WAS BEHIND YOU. THE PUBLIC LOST INTEREST IN THE CRAWFORD CASE YEARS AGO. NOT TRUE. HIS ARTWORK IS AS POPULAR AS EVER. HIS WORK IS BEING EXHIBITED IN A GALLERY DOWNTOWN RIGHT NOW. WHAT IS IT WITH YOU, JEN? THIS FASCINATION WITH LOST CAUSES. RAYMOND CRAWFORD WAS WRONGLY ACCUSED. HE WAS CONVICTED BY A JURY OF HIS PEERS. THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE WAS GUILTY, DAVID. C'MON, JURIES MAKE MISTAKES. AND BESIDES, RAYMOND CRAWFORD MAKES A GREAT COPY. I'LL GIVE YOU A DAY. BUT IF NOTHING NEWSWORTHY TURNS UP... I NEVER WANNA HEAR THE NAME RAYMOND CRAWFORD AGAIN, AGREED? THANKS. TAKE THESE PHOTOS DOWN TO LAYOUT. FOR NOW, YOU'VE GOT PAGE THREE. ♪ MUSIC ♪ I'M ASKING YOU TO SEND BLY TO A PSYCH WARD INSTEAD OF TO A PRISON. HE'S WILLING TO PLEAD GUILTY IF YOU CAN GUARANTEE AN INSANITY VERDICT. WHY SHOULD I DO THAT? IT'D SAVE A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY ON THE TRIAL. I NEED A SWEETENER. SOMETHING I DON'T ALREADY HAVE. WELL, FOR STARTERS... THE KOWALSKI GIRL. WHAT ABOUT HER? BLY'S WILLING TO PLEAD TO THAT. WE ALREADY HAVE SOMEONE IN PRISON FOR THE KOWALSKI MURDER. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU GOT THE RIGHT GUY. IT'S CRAP, AMOS. BLY READS THE PAPERS. HE'D COP TO THE KILLING OF KENNEDY IF IT KEPT HIM OUT OF THE JOINT. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE AN INNOCENT MAN ROTTING IN JAIL. [LAUGHS] OH NO, NOT IN AN ELECTION YEAR. TALK TO MY CLIENT. GIVE HIM A LIE DETECTOR. HE WANTS TO COOPERATE ON THIS. OKAY. DO WE HAVE A DEAL? THERE'S A DEFINITE POSSIBILITY. ♪ MUSIC ♪ WAKE UP BLY, YOUR LAWYER WANTS TO SEE YOU. C'MON BLY. SWEET JESUS. ♪ MUSIC ♪ BLY IS DEAD. I KNOW. SLIT HIS WRISTS WITH A CRUCIFIX. COULDN'T THINK OF A BETTER WAY TO GO. OH, THIS IS GREAT FOR CRAWFORD'S CASE. I DON'T THINK SO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HIS LAWYER TOLD ME HE CONFESSED TO THE KOWALSKI MURDER. I SAW BLY'S INTERROGATION. I WOULDN'T PUT MUCH FAITH IN IT. YOU SAW IT? HERE, CONSIDER IT A GIFT. I'M IMPRESSED. DON'T BE. CAPTAIN MCCARTHY'S AN OLD BUDDY OF MINE. HE OWES ME A FEW, THAT'S ALL. IF YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING TO CORROBORATE CRAWFORD'S INNOCENCE, WE'LL GO PAGE ONE. FAIR ENOUGH. THANKS DAVID. DON'T THANK ME. NOT YET. ♪ MUSIC ♪ [NEWS REPORT IN THE BACKGROUND] [NEWS REPORT IN THE BACKGROUND] [NEWS REPORT IN THE BACKGROUND] [NEWS REPORT IN THE BACKGROUND] [DOOR CLANG] OVER THERE. MR. CRAWFORD. I'M JENNIFER KINGSLEY FROM THE EXAMINER. HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND ABOUT DOING THIS INTERVIEW? NO. I... COULD YOU STAND OVER THERE? OVER THERE IN THE LIGHT. OH, THAT'S GOOD. HE BUTCHERED ANOTHER MODEL, DIDN'T HE? THE SAME AS BEFORE. THE MAN WHO KILLED LOIS KOWALSKI. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. I KNEW HE WOULD. ALL THIS TIME I'VE BEEN WAITING. I KNEW HE WOULD DO IT AGAIN. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOUR CASE REOPENED? JOE BLY WAS MY TICKET OUT OF HERE. NOW THAT HE'S DEAD... THERE'S NO WAY THEY'RE GONNA LET ME OUT OF HERE. OH, I THINK THEY MIGHT. I DIDN'T KILL LOIS KOWALSKI MISS KINGSLEY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONVINCE ME. THAT WITNESS, THAT WOMAN MARY GRIMES. SHE'S WRONG. I WASN'T THERE. I WAS AT HOME GETTING DRUNK. BUT I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL THIS AGAIN BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T NEED ANOTHER STORY ABOUT BEING A REHABILITATED CRIMINAL. I DON'T NEED THAT. WELL, I'M NOT MAKING ANY PROMISES. BUT I THINK I CAN HELP YOU. I'VE BEEN HERE FOR FOUR YEARS. IT'S PRETTY HARD TO BELIEVE ANYTHING AT THIS POINT. BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT. I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT DURING THE TRIAL. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE TO POINT OUT THE LACK OF EVIDENCE AGAINST ME. I NEVER THOUGHT THE POLICE PROVED THEIR CASE. SO WHY ARE YOU REALLY HERE? I WOULD LOVE TO DO AN INTERVIEW WITH YOU. WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME? WHAT AM I GONNA GET OUT OF THIS DEAL, HUH? MORE PUBLIC SUPPORT... AND A CHANCE. IT'S ALL I CAN OFFER YOU. FAIR ENOUGH. IT'S GOOD. THANK YOU. [BIRDS CHIRPING] HERE, I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO HOT. I'M SURE IT'S FINE, THANK YOU. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NEW INFORMATION IN THE RAYMOND CRAWFORD CASE. OH, WHAT'S THAT? SOMEONE ELSE HAS CONFESSED... TO THE MURDER OF LOIS KOWALSKI. AND IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN I HELPED SEND AN INNOCENT MAN TO PRISON. ARE YOU HAVING DOUBTS ABOUT YOUR TESTIMONY, MRS. GRIMES? NO. COULD IT HAVE BEEN SOMEONE OTHER THAN RAYMOND CRAWFORD YOU SAW THAT NIGHT? READ THE COURT TRANSCRIPT, IT'S ALL THERE. IT'S OKAY VINCENT. CAN WE GO THROUGH IT? ONE MORE TIME. IT WAS LATE. I WAS LOST. I JUST WANTED TO GET HOME. THAT'S WHEN I SAW HIM. HE WAS COMING OUT OF THE BUILDING. HE WAS HOLDING HIS LEFT HAND. IT WAS BLEEDING BADLY. AND THAT'S WHEN HE LOOKED RIGHT AT ME. IT WAS HIM. RAYMOND CRAWFORD. ARE YOU SURE? MY WIFE IS NOT A LIER MISS KINGSLEY. IF SHE SAYS IT WAS HIM, YOU CAN COUNT ON IT. I'LL SHOW YOU OUT. OH, THANK YOU. I APPRECIATED YOUR TIME. ♪ MUSIC ♪ MARY, I THOUGHT WE PUT THIS BEHIND US. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL HER A THING. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. I DON'T LIKE HER. NOT ONE BIT. [BIRDS CHIRPING] MARY GRIMES WAS LYING THEN, SHE'S LYING NOW. IT DOESN'T HELP THAT YOU KNEW LOIS KOWALSKI OR THAT THEY FOUND SKETCHES OF HER ALL THOUGH YOUR APARTMENT. SHE WAS ONE OF MY MODELS. I KNEW A LOT OF MODELS. I HAVE A PICTURE OF ELVIS PRESLEY, IT DOESN'T MEAN I KILLED HIM TOO. YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER. [SIGHS] I WENT OUT WITH HER A FEW TIMES. AM I IN TRIAL NOW OR WHAT? THEY FOUND HER NUMBER IN JOE BLY'S ADDRESS BOOK. WELL, THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. I'M GETTING A LOT OF FAVORABLE MAIL ABOUT YOU AT THE PAPER. PEOPLE ARE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT YOUR CONVICTION. IF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FELT THAT WAY, IT'D BE GREAT. HE'S STARTING TO THINK THERE'S ENOUGH PROBABLE CAUSE FOR A RETRIAL. REALLY? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, JENNIFER. I OWE YOU FOR THIS ONE. I'LL HELP YOU, BUT DON'T EVER LIE TO ME OR MAKE A FOOL OF ME. JENNIFER... I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER'S LIFE, I DID NOT KILL LOIS KOWALSKI. ♪ MUSIC ♪ [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] WONDERFUL, AREN'T THEY? INCREDIBLE DETAIL. ARE YOU A COLLECTOR. NO, NOT EXACTLY. AN ARTIST. I USED TO PAINT... WATER COLORS MOSTLY. I'M AFRAID THE GALLERY'S BOOKED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. OH NO, I'M NOT LOOKING TO SHOW MY WORK. MY NAME'S JENNIFER KINGSLEY. I'M WITH THE EXAMINER, AND WE'RE THINKING OF DOING A STORY ON THIS ARTIST. HOW LONG HAVE YOU REPRESENTED HIM? I'VE CARRIED SOME OF HIS PIECES FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. EVERYONE'S INTERESTED IN HIM. I'VE HEARD. I'M PLANNING ON SHOWING SOME OF HIS NEW WORK... IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. UNFORTUNATELY, HE'S NOT AS PROLIFIC AS HE MIGHT BE RIGHT NOW. HE'S IN PRISON, I'M AFRAID. YES, I KNOW. OBVIOUSLY YOUR BUYERS DON'T MIND? OH, ON THE CONTRARY. IT SEEMS TO ADD TO HIS MYSTIQUE. YOU KNOW, I THINK ART LOVERS LIKE TO THINK OF THEIRS ARTISTS AS, YOU KNOW, ECCENTRIC CHARACTERS. LIKE O. HENRY WRITING THOSE STORIES FROM HIS PRISON CELL. OR PAGANINI IN PRISON FOR RAPING A TEENAGE GIRL. MORBID FASCINATION WITH THEIR DANGEROUS PAST. I THINK WE'RE ALL INTRIGUED WITH THE IDEA THAT HANDS THAT CAN SO EASILY TAKE A LIFE... CAN ALSO PRODUCE SUCH BEAUTY. HMM. ♪ MUSIC ♪ HELLO, DEX. HELLO, JEN, BEEN A LONG TIME. YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD. THANK YOU, YOU TOO. I DRESSED FOR YOU. I SEE THE PLACE STILL LOOKS THE SAME. I THINK I RECOGNIZE THE SANDWICH. YEAH. [CHUCKLES] I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, JEN. I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

I WENT TO SEE CRAWFORD. OH CHRIST. AND HE STILL SAYS HE'S INNOCENT. YEAH, HIM AND EVERY OTHER CON. THE GUY'S BEEN IN AND OUT OF TROUBLE ALL HIS LIFE. HE FOOLED YOU FOUR YEARS AGO. I WAS NEVER FOOLED. CONFUSED THEN. YOU KNOW, IT'S POSSIBLE SOMEONE MADE A MISTAKE. NOW, YOU NEVER FOUND THE WEAPON AND YOU AGONIZED OVER THAT. WE DIDN'T NEED THE WEAPON 'CAUSE WE HAD THE RIGHT GUY. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE? YOU KNOW, HASN'T THIS CAUSED US ENOUGH PAIN, HUH? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEING CONTRADICTED BY YOU IN PRINT? I WAS ONLY DOING MY JOB, DEX. MY JOB...AT WHAT COST? WELL I GUESS WE LET OUR CAREERS GET IN THE WAY. OUR CAREERS? [CHUCKLES] YOU AND I LIVED TOGETHER FOR THREE YEARS AND WE NEVER HAD A FIGHT UNTIL THIS CASE. WELL, THINGS WEREN'T AS PERFECT AS YOU SEEM TO REMEMBER. I NEEDED YOU, JEN. YOU WEREN'T THERE. I'M SORRY YOU SEE IT THAT WAY. BUT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, JEN.

MARY, THERE'S SOMETHING I'M HOPING YOU CAN CLARIFY FOR ME. YES. WHEN I READ THE TRANSCRIPTS FROM RAYMOND CRAWFORD'S TRIAL, YOU DIDN'T MENTION THE CUT ON HIS HAND. I DIDN'T? WELL, I WAS NERVOUS. THE LAWYERS WERE SO INTIMIDATING. I COULDN'T REMEMBER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THE POLICE REPORT DIDN'T MENTION THE BLOOD SAMPLES FROM THE CRIME SCENE ASIDE FROM LOIS KOWALSKI. WOULDN'T SOME OF MR. CRAWFORD'S BLOOD HAVE BEEN FOUND WITH SUCH A BAD CUT? I DON'T KNOW. I SAW RAYMOND CRAWFORD RECENTLY. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY SCARS ON HIS HANDS. PERHAPS YOU DIDN'T GET AS GOOD A LOOK AS YOU THOUGHT. [THUNDER] IT WAS DARK. IT WAS RAINING. MARY, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL ME? OH GOD, I THINK I MIGHT HAVE DONE A TERRIBLE THING. I MIGHT HAVE RUINED A MAN'S LIFE. I'M LISTENING, MARY. THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER... THE POLICE SHOWED UP AT MY DOOR BECAUSE A WITNESS HAD, HAD SEEN MY CAR AT THE CRIME SCENE. AND I TOLD THEM THE TRUTH THAT I DIDN'T SEE... I DIDN'T SEE HIS FACE. I WAS SO NERVOUS. THEY, THEY WERE TREATING ME LIKE A SUSPECT. AND THEN THEY, THEY SHOWED ME HIS PICTURE. RAYMOND CRAWFORD'S? AND I SAID, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIM, BUT I DIDN'T GET A CLEAR ENOUGH LOOK TO BE SURE. BUT THEY SAID THAT, THAT HE WAS KOWALSKI'S BOYFRIEND AND THAT HE WAS THE KILLER... AND THAT HE WAS GONNA DO THAT TO OTHER WOMEN IF I DIDN'T STOP HIM. I WAS SO SCARED, I...I WAS CONFUSED. ARE YOU TELLING ME THE POLICE PUT YOU UP TO IT? YES. MARY, WE HAVE TO TELL SOMEONE. OH NO, I COULDN'T. NO, IT WOULD ONLY CAUSE MORE TROUBLE. IF YOU TELL THE TRUTH NOW, NO ONE WILL PUNISH YOU. YOU CAN'T LET AN INNOCENT MAN SUFFER IN JAIL. [SIGHS] WORKING LATE? NOT NOW, MIKE. LISTEN, I WAS JUST WONDERING IF...
