He said that one day There'd be an olympic gold in there. It wasn't winning that was important to him. It was the hard work, The dedication, What a metal represents. Trash can. Me? I like to win. With improvement, ladies, That could have been terrible. Does anyone want to pack their bags and go home? I didn't think so. Then i don't ever want to see that kind of practice again. Understood? All: yes. Good. Tomorrow we seat race. I know, i know. Just get your hands in here. All right, guys. Big day tomorrow. Hard work on three. One, two, three. All: hard work. Mm-Hmm. Yeah. Watch as joey decides who has to go home. Good girl, giselle? He's dumping two girls tonight. I got to go, mom. Call you back, okay? I'll call you back. And that's why we shouldn't even be talking About bridgette right now. Oh, boy. - She's gone. - Nuh-Uh. Mm-Hmm. Oh. All right. Next seat race. Kelsey versus abi. Last chance to impress me. Sit ready. Attention. Row. Hmm. I'll get the coffee. And $1.25 is your change. Have a good day. Hi, how you doing today? All right? That will be $5. And there's your change. Have a great day. Hello.

Anderson? Jill's still in the front seat. You said we were switching. She can have the front seat until we get to the course. We'll switch on the way back. I take it those are your girls? I could try to deny it, But i think the t-Shirt might give me away. Things sure have changed. I mean, when i went to union, None of my coaches were so-- Awesome? Male. Yeah, technically, i'm not their coach. Their coach is on maternity leave. Permanent maternity leave, as it turns out. So as athletic director, It's my job to fill in until i can find a replacement. Athletic director? Wow. How 'bout you? How's the training going? Great, um, yeah. Good. That's good. I should probably get back to the girls. Of course. Do you want to, um, i mean, If you're in town tonight, There's a really great pizza place. That sounds great. Yeah? Like, probably 6:30? It's a date. I mean, i didn't mean a date. It's a pizza place, right? Flanigan's boathouse. Oh, abi. It's good to see you. Was that... And? And he's in princeton for the races this weekend. And? And we're coming by to get pizza tonight. 128. Abi. 131. You're gonna have to drop a pound, abi. So what can i get you to drink while you wait? - Uh, yuengling. - My man. Oh, and a diet pepsi. Hey. You still going? Huh? You still going?

Ordered you a diet pepsi. Want a slice of pizza or something? It's on the house. Nah, i'm good. Thanks. How 'bout cheesy movie when i get home, huh? I'll cut out here early tonight? Thanks, reba. Sorry, abi. Please, god. Please help me get on this team. I've just worked so hard. Please. You are all excellent rowers. But when it comes to winning the olympics, I need more than excellence. I need women who, come race day, Will dig beyond what they think physically possible. I need women who will fight For that extra half-Inch, That extra 3/100 of a second. Because if you lose The olympics by 3/100 of a second, You will take that to your grave. Thank you for your hard work And dedication. I have put together what i am sure Is a winning boat. Coach. I don't understand. I know you're disappointed, abi. Disappointed? I worked my ass off the past four years. I did everything you said. And you want me to be the alternate again? I won the seat race; i deserve to be in that boat. Kelsey has better erg scores. That's ridiculous. Ergs don't float. I won't the seat race. You don't have the reach you need off the recovery. You're flexibility-- Is fine. I have the technique. I know how to win. My decision's made. You can change your mind. Please. I'm sorry. Is it because she's younger? No. It's because she's better. Now get in the launch before you lose your spot on this team. Yeah, it'll be good to see you too, mom. Mom, let me call you back. I'll call you right back. I quit. You what? I'm not watching from the sidelines again. If i'm not in the boat, i'm not on the team. Abi, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look--Look, you need to slow down a second. I know you're upset, but you got to think this over-- If i wanted you're opinion i would have asked. - It helps. - No. Thanks. Ugh. Kelsey's so stupid. You're way better. Coach? Mm-Hmm. Yes. Yes, sir. Okay, yeah. I'll be right down. 'Kay. Thank you. I'm the new alternate. Congratulations. You don't want it, do you? 'Cause if you want it, abi, i don't -- It's all yours. Thanks. I mean-- Okay, i got to get to practice. Get. Go. I'll call you later, okay? I love you, abi. Whoo! Wakey, wakey, sunshine. It's after 7:00. How are you doing? - Fine. - Yeah? I bought this for you On the way home from work last night. I think that you will find it helpful. Have a good day. Mom. There are egg whites in the refrigerator. Honey? Abigail? Hey megan. It's abi. Sorry i've been out of touch. Anyway, i'm in town And was wondering if you wanted To grab a drink when you're free. Hope the wedding planning's going well. Mmm. What time is it? It's time for you to take a shower And put on some decent clothes. We have a guest coming for dinner. And clean up your mess in here. Who's coming? Dry your hair, please. It'll dry. Abigail brooks, i did not raise you To greet company with sopping wet hair. Put some lipstick on, please. I know it's not a lot of money. But if you're as smart as your mom says you are, Then a pretty lady like you should have no trouble Securing a permanent job at the end of the internship. Hmm? Hmm? Fabulous wine, diane. I got it at auction. And wait till you see the perks That come with the position. Dinners, tickets, nice wine. Excuse me, ladies. Singapore. Oh. Hey, j.D., What's up man? Yeah, uh-Huh.

Anyway, i made a few calls, And it looks like you can start as early as next week. Mr. Cox-- Hey, whoa. Call me coxy. Coxy... Hmm. I really appreciate the offer-- Like i said, anything to help a friend. Oh, and you know what? A lot of former athletes in the biz. You'll fit right in. I really appreciate the offer. But i'm good. Why don't you sleep on it? You're 30 years old. I'm 29 1/2. It's time to move on, Do something with you life. I am doing something with my life. What? What are you doing? Watching television all day? What? Well, right now, i'm taking some time off. Figure some stuff out. Then in a few weeks, I'll start training again. Abi, that's-- You just asked me what i was doing. Would you just listen to me? There are tons of olympic athletes In their 30s these days. I can apologize to coach, Work harder, be better. You are talking about winning the lottery, abi. That's great, mom. Thanks for the support. I have supported your dream your whole life. But the rowing thing hasn't worked out. It is time for you to move on. You don't want this job offer? Fine. Go to graduate school. Figure it out there. I can't afford that. I will loan you the money. I'm not going back to school, mom. I'm a rower. That's what i do. You're a grown-Up. You make your own decisions. Thank you. But if you are thinking of rowing for four more years, You're not doing it under this roof. Mom. You want my support? Get a job. Ugh. Stupid heels. Come in. Abi. This is a surprise. I could come back if now's not a good time. No, no, no. Come on in. Come on. Have a seat. Thanks. I want to apologize about the other night. Practice ran late and-- Already forgotten.

You want to do it at lunch? Works for me. Great. I moved back home. What about-- Not happening. Are you okay? I'm fine. Listen, i-- I know this probably won't make you feel better-- In fact, i'm sure nothing would make you feel better right now, But you should know how proud of you everyone here is. I mean, the fact that you made it as far as you did-- That's pretty major. Is there anything i can do to help? We have chairs in this house. I got the job. What's it pay? Enough. It wasn't enough back in your father's day. Okay, you know what? Recycling. All right, girls, Stotesbury's coming up next weekend. It's a big race, so i got you a new coach.

We don't have all day here, ladies. That's hannah. She does that a lot. She doesn't get along with the other girls? It's not that. They actually look up to her. But for some reason, she likes to pretend She doesn't want to be here and doesn't care. Walk it forward. Comes from a big family of rowers. And the other girl? Susan. Total opposite. They balance each other out nicely. Now, they're not there yet, but as a double, I think they have the talent to go to henley. Especially now that they have me as a coach. In spite of that, yeah.

This painting is so accurate That scholars were able to pinpoint the exact time of day, 7:20 p.M. Huh. So why am i going on about all this? Because rowing is an art. We see this painting hanging on the wall, And it looks beautiful, Effortless. We don't see the work that went into creating it. When i have you guys practice tedious things Over and over again on the water, It's because we're working towards creating this ease On race day. Because race day should be beautiful. It may hurt like hell, But it should be beautiful. And that, girls, is what we need to find. The art in our rowing. Our official team calendar. Every monday morning leading up to henley, We're gonna mark down what we want to work on Each day at practice. It can be something like slide control Or blade work, Whatever you guys think will be helpful. I've marked down our first goal. "Trust." Okay, susan. Your turn. Nice and slow. Use your feet. Set the boat. Now let go of your oars. Trust yourself. How 'bout that, huh? Whoo. Okay, now sit down. Dude, that was awesome. I'm just glad we didn't go swimming.

Abi, if you truly think That rowing in the olympics is going to make you happy, Then you should do it. But i have seen something this last month I haven't seen in a long time. I've seen you happy. Not beating yourself up. Not starving yourself. What about reba? She's expecting that seat. It was mine first. You gave it up. Now it's hers. She'll understand. You'd be surprised how little understanding A friendship can take. Why aren't you on my side? Abi, i am on your side. Look, there were a lot of saturdays You and your dad went bike riding. And i stayed in that office Because i knew what i wanted. I wanted a nice house with nice things in it. And a garden with no beetles. And now i have it. But if i could have those saturdays back With you and your dad... Sometimes, you don't know what you have until you lose it. Why can't it wait until after henley? Susan, i wish it could, But it doesn't work that way. You don't want it to work that way. You don't give a shit. We're just a job to you. That's not true. I-- Susan, let it go. It's the olympics. Come on. Hello? Hey guys. Talk to you for a sec? Yeah. So this wasn't an easy decision-- Because i'm just as good as you and you know it? I told everyone. Everyone thinks i'm rowing in the olympics, But see i'm not, because my best friend Just swooped in out of nowhere and stole my seat. My best friend who quit the team Rather than stick it out as the alternate. You made a choice not to row on the olympic team, And now that glory's here, You just breeze on in As if that seat is your god-Given right. It's not. Not since the moment you quit the team. And you should look around you, Because nobody wants you back. You're right. I know i'm right 'cause-- What? The seat belongs to you. Are you sure? Don't screw it up. - Yes. - Yeah. Hi, you've reached geoff anderson. I'm not checking messages this week, Because i am out of the country. But if you leave a message-- Hair spray? Really? Excuse me, hi. I'm trying to get on the 6:50 flight to london. Is there an express line? Are you elite status? Elite what? Will you be flying first class? Look, i really need to get on the flight. If i wait in that line, I'm gonna miss it. There's got to be a way to get me through on time. There is. Arrive two hours before your flight And wait on line like the rest of america. No clean laundry. Happens to me all the time. Unfortunately, the 6:50 flight Just closed its doors for takeoff. You're kidding. I can get you on the 9:00 p.M. Flight, But the only seats available are in first class. What else do you have? Nothing 'till wednesday. Would you like that first class seat? Do you have another card i can try? Abi brooks. We could do it, But it would be 250,000 miles, mr. Cox. Done. Do it. Are you sure about this? Like i said, my job comes with a lot of perks. Say hi to your mom for me. And, hey, wait 'till you taste the food in first class. They serve ice cream sundaes. Enter roundabout And turn left. Left? Turn left. Okay. Turn left. Recalculating. Shit. Wouldn't want you girls to go hungry in the boat. Now would we? Thank you. Oh, pardon me. I can't believe they serve this stuff for breakfast. I can't believe you're eating that stuff for breakfast. - Mmm. - Gross. Okay, girls. I'm sorry to bother you mr. Anderson, But there's someone here to see you. You should have seen me try to drive On the wrong side of the road. I practically killed myself going around One of those circle-Y things. Come here. Abi, what are you doing here? Would you believe me if i said i was in the neighborhood? I was hoping the crew coach position was still available. What do you want me to say? Please come back? We'd be happy to have you? Works for me. Doesn't work for me. You don't get it. I love what i do. I'm proud of what i do. I'm happy at union. You weren't. And it's fine. It's not that i don't understand. I do, but-- For everyone's sake, Until you figure out what you want, I think it's best if we just... Go our separate ways. Okay. I was happy. I liked having a life, Being normal, doing normal things. I mean, maybe not at first, But i fell in love with coaching. With the girls. With you. Again. And...that scared me. Because it wasn't something like a medal That i could lock up and keep. And when i was offered that spot in the boat After telling myself for so long That that would make it all worthwhile, I wasn't strong enough to say "no." Because the olympics would make it all make sense. The years i spent locked up in the gym, The life i missed, It would all be worth something. But then yesterday, In my apartment, ready for practice, I felt lonely. I didn't want it anymore. Not with what it was gonna cost. Life can only be understood backwards. What're you waiting for? Don't just stand there. Go get her. You think? Both: yes. Abi. Nice parking. The girls didn't win henley that year. But four years later, They won something else. Life has a funny way of working out. In the end, I did win an olympic gold. Kind of. Right this way. Come on. Don't be timid. You're such a scaredy-Cat. I don't like surprises. You'll like this one. Congratulations, coach. Apparently you do know a little something about winning. It's perfect. I love it. One more thing. Kind of a tradition. It was awesome. You know what's even more awesome? What? Come on. I'm not even-- Get in. All right, fine. if i should fall behind you if i'm too small to see if i should get pulled under would you come and rescue me when every would-Be moment is just a yesterday and every star we wish on is just a universe away would you pull me cross the water would you push me to the line would you be the one to hold me high if i should fall behind a boathouse row november the river falls ahead Â™ª a feeling i remember wishing you were here instead with every would-Be moment is one more yesterday and every star we wish on is one more universe away would you pull me cross the water would you push me to the line would you be the one to hold me high if i should fall behind yeah if i if i, if i if i should fall behind if i if i, if i if i should fall behind would you pull me cross the water would you push me to the line would you be the one to hold me high if i should fall behind and beyond the blue horizon one another we will find and you'll be the one to hold me high if i should fall behind Synchronization R.O.D.
