What new kid? Night cook. What'’s his name that got mugged? No. What happened? Well, you know, this new kid, he'’s on the beach. Yeah? And how it happened he was in East Chicago after the last pay draw... Yeah. ...last week and drawn all he could and he'’s making the bars with a C or so in his pocket and flashing that wad every chance he gets. Oh, boy. What does the kid know? I mean, what do they know at that age? No offense. Yeah. So, as I understand it, this slut comes on to him. He takes her outside the bar, outside they go, bippity boppity boo, hoping that would improve the evening. Wouldn'’t it just if things go all right? But that was not the thing of it. He makes his move and he gets a wallop. By the slut? Yeah. I mean he had a few so he wasn'’t in any shape. Anyways, she picks his wad and his Z-card. Oh, not his Z-card. Yup, and his gate pass. And he didn'’t even get laid, did he? Fuck, no. She rolled him first then she left. Man. So, he stumbles back to the gate. He'’s drunk, sobbing... Nothing to be ashamed of. The guards won'’t let him in. I mean, he'’s bleeding and dirty. You didn'’t tell me he was bleeding. But that'’s understood. So go on. And dirty and no identification. So of course they won'’t let him in. Are you fucking ignorant? Bastards. Eh? Well, they'’re just-- they'’re just doing their jobs. I suppose you'’re right. Pretty nice guys, actually. I suppose. And so, well, where-- where was I? Uh, the part where they won'’t let him in. And the guards won'’t let him in. But, what'’s his name? A guy about 40 or so, you know him. I'’m new. Well, anyway, what'’s his name happens to be coming through and of course, he recognizes what'’s his name. Yeah. So, "What happened, how are you," all that shit and the guard explains to him how they can'’t let the guy in. He'’s with the boat, it'’s okay. And the guy vouches right up for him. Don'’t worry about it. Oh, he'’s a good man, huh? And they still won'’t let him through. Yeah? So how he gets in? Yeah. He waits until these guards are looking the other way. I don'’t know. Either secretary or train, I don'’t know, and he walked right through the main gate. Bunch of assholes, huh? Oh, I don'’t know. So what happened with Skippy? You know Skippy? No. The first mate. Oh, yeah. So what happened with him is this. The poor slob makes it back to the fucking boat. He'’s drunk and bleeding and broke, right? He gets to the gangway. The second is on the deck, supervising offloading. Right. He'’s talking on the box with Skippy, the first mate, who'’s up on the bridge. Now Skippy, he sees this poor thing trumping up the pier and he says to Collins the second: Collins, we got passengers this trip. Get that man below and tell him to stay there till he'’s sober. Although Skippy is a hell of a nice guy, he'’s the oldest first mate on the lake, did you know that? No. Yeah, he was a master once. I don'’t know who for. But that'’s why they call him Skippy. Uh-huh. I heard that. I don'’t actually know it but that'’s why they call him Skippy. So anyway Collins collars the slob and tells him to get below. "Who says so?" "The first says so," says Collins. So Guglian Nickolini, something like that. What? The guy'’s name. So whatever, Guigliani, what'’s his name says, "Tell the first to go fuck himself." So as God would have it, at that precise moment, the box rings and it'’s Skippy wanting to talk to Collins. Collins, what'’s holding up the number three hold? "I'’m talking to Guigliani," Collins says. What the all-fired fuck does he have to say that'’s so important? He'’s telling me that I should tell you to go fuck yourself. Says Collins. So Skippy, who'’s bandied enough words at this point says... Collins, throw that man in the canal and get three hold the fuck off loading! Yes, sir! Which I happen to be working on, too, at the time. So? So, what? So, did he throw him in the canal? I don'’t know, I was down below. I heard this. And where'’s the guy now? What am I, a mind reader? On the beach somewhere, lost his job. Up in East Chicago, I guess. Poor son of a bitch. Oh, I don'’t know. Pretty sight, ain'’t it? Pretty sight, ain'’t it? Yo, Joe. Yo, Joe. Stan. You picked me up them razor blades? Oh shit, I fucking forgot. I'’m sorry. Fucking forgot? You fucking forgot? Memory is a terrible thing. Ain'’t it? I hoped to tell you. What? Are you supposed to salute the, uh, the... Don'’t worry about it. Attention all hands. Please remember company policy. All alcohol is zero tolerance. We will depart at... Boy, was I drunk last night. I'’m still drunk. That wine. Drink wine it dehydrates you. When you drink water the next morning, it activates the alcohol. I'’m so hungover I can't see. Can'’t see? I can'’t even talk. I can'’t even fucking think straight. You couldn'’t think straight last night. I was drunk last night. You'’re still drunk. Yeah. No good, man. Yeah. No damn, good. I'’m sure of that. No fucking good. What, drinking? Drinking, life, women, the boat, no good. It'’s not that bad. No fucking good. You'’ve been drinking? Drinking? Don'’t talk to me about drinking. What the hell would it ever get me? Drinking? I was drinking before you were wiping your own ass. Beer? I drunk more beer in my time than I could remember. I could tick off my life in beer caps, bottles, cans, pop tops, screw-tops. Bottles? Every man on this ship had his own opener. I remember. Around the neck. Holy Mary. Don'’t tell me about beer, Joe. Please don'’t tell me about beer. I drunk beer. Wine. Ah, wine. Used to drink it with every meal. White, cherry, you need a taste for wine. I got one. Domestic and imported. Love the stuff. Red and white, I'’ve drunk it. Wine with my food, cigarette smoldering and chilled wine, warm spice wine, sweet cherry wine. I know wine, Joe. What about liqueurs? What about them? Yeah. For faggots, but booze? Booze? Scotch and rye, drink bourbon by the fifth. When I lived at home, drink, my father could drink. My father could, too. I say that man could put it away a fifth a day and more, Joe, and more. My father, too. He loved the stuff. Killed him, my father. My father drink it by the fifth. He never lacked for booze, that man, that'’s one thing I can say for him. Yeah. Nothing too good for him. Yeah. The old bastard drinks thorough. He didn'’t give a shit. I know. That man could drink. How about your mother? She could drink, too. My mother couldn'’t drink. No? The old man said it was bad for her. Women, what do they know of booze? They can'’t drink. Nothing. Do you ever know a woman who could drink? Yeah. What do they know? A girl from Duluth. They don'’t understand it. It'’s a man's thing, drinking. It'’s a curse and an elevation. It makes you an angel, a booze ridden angel, drinking. I know my alcohol, boy. I know it and you know I know it. And I know it. I'’ll take you below. I got to go on watch. Domestic and imported. Come on, Stan. Anyway you call it. I got to go on watch. Mixed drinks, I know my mixed drinks. You name one I know it, mixed drinks. Manhattan. I know it. Come on, Stan. Ah, leave me alone. Come on, I got to go on watch. Well, go on watch, you fucking Polack. Who'’s a Polack? Trust the Polack to go on watch when I'’m pissed. I'’ll take you down to the dunnage room and get you some coffee. I don'’t want any coffee. I want to go to sleep. Well, let'’s go then. I want to sleep by myself. Okay, Stan, let'’s get you off your feet. Off of deck? Sure. And who are you to tell me to get off a deck of a ship we both happen to be on? Come on, God damn it. Getting mad, huh? Stosh. Getting a trifle warm. Aren'’t you getting warm? All right, Stan. Fucking no class Polack. Can'’t even hold your liquor. Maybe not but I'’ll tell you one thing. I'’ll tell you one thing. I'’ll tell you one thing. I'’m going for coffee. I'’ll tell you one thing, you son of a bitch. Yeah. Litko. Mr. Collins. Skippy wants a sandwich. Mr. Collins, look, I just came on. I ain'’t on yet. Ain'’t on yet? No. Well, get him a sandwich, will you? Take you a second. I--but... Have you been drinking? No, sir. Can we speed this up at all? Get him a sandwich, will you? It'’s an act of Christian charity.

Mr. Collins, we gonna get a new nightman or what? Huh? Nightman? Yeah, yeah, sure. Crender said we'’ll have him this trip. Well, that'’s good 'cause, you know, I don'’t want to be making sandwiches all the way to Canada, if you know what I mean. Not that I mind it, but, you know, I just fucking hate making sandwiches for other people to eat. And wrap it in wax paper, will you? Yeah, sure. And make sure you get those boats clean today, huh? Right as rain. Glad to hear you say that. That'’s right, assholes. That'’s right. Fuck off on your fire and evacuations. Your ass is gonna be in a big sling when we have to drill for the Coast Guard.

F and E, boy. I don'’t know what that means, sir? Fire, fire and evacuation. I don'’t think I have one, sir. How long have you been on this ship? About a half hour, sir. Nobody likes a smart ass. Nobody likes a smart ass. No one. You'’ve been on this ship a short time, say so. Have you got that? Yes, sir. You know who I am? No, sir. Yeah.

Different time, different men. No help for us. Where'’s my sandwich? Litko is getting it. He'’s not in the Stewards. Where'’s the night cook? He got mugged. He'’s in the hospital.

Yes, sir. Good. Make one for Skippy, the First Mate, and then make one for the fireman. Right. What kind? For the first an egg, for the fireman, how the fuck should I know? Make him an egg, all right. Sure. Good. And then I heard she tells him she was divorced, how about that? So what? I'’m divorced. Sorry. So now they start getting really blind. My mother was a blind. And could Guigliani spare some change, you know, twenty for the kids or something for the groceries. Yeah. And the whole time she'’s drinking his rum with coke and lime. Coke and lime? That'’s what I heard. That'’s the way they drink it in Italy. You'’ve never been to Italy. How the fuck do you know? Fuck. How the everlasting cock-sucking fuck do you know I never been to Italy? "Don'’t Do Shit All Day" tells me where I never been. So then I heard, she'’d have a drink. Yeah. He'’d have a drink. Yeah? Next thing you know, Guigliani gets up, he'’s knocking over tables, he'’s staggering around like he'’s ready to die. Meanwhile she'’s still walking a straight line. Uh-huh. I wonder what'’s the matter with Joe? Why do you say there'’s something to matter with Joe? Well, I don'’t know. I just, you know... Who the hell are you? What? I-- Twenty-some years on a boat watching a little dial, all of a sudden you want to know what'’s wrong with Joe. Hey, look at, I was just saying... Just listen to me. The man'’s done more shit in his life than you'’ll ever forget. I only said... Just remember that, Mr. Wise ass. He'’d been to more places than you ever been. He never been in Italy. What kind of white bluffing bullshit is that? Hey, I'’m fucking Italian. Don'’t talk to me, Sta... Hi? Hi. How are you? Fine, in the sense that I feel like shit. Been to Italy. Mm-hm. "Been to Italy." Uh, you want a sandwich? Yeah. You'’re the new nightman? Yes. Do you like egg? I don'’t give a fuck. What do you do down here? Down here? I read. How can you read and do your job? I'’m not answerable to you. I'’m answerable to the Chief. I was just asking. I do my job, okay? Oh, I know that. I do my job, I keep busy, and I read a bit. It doesn'’t get in your way, the reading? No. I mean I got to watch the two gauges, four actually. I got the two mains, those are the two you got to watch, and then the two auxiliary. Uh-huh. But the two main, those are the two you want to watch '’cause if they go... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, if that main, if she goes--if she goes red line, you are fucking fucked. And then you switch... No, I'’m not-- I don'’t do nothing. I don'’t touch a thing. I don'’t do a god damn thing. I shut down which ever blows. The larboard to the starboard and then I call the bridge and then I call on the Chief in that order. That'’s what I do. And then you watch the auxiliary. Nothing to watch. Engine shut down, gauges is dead. What'’s the point of having the auxiliary gauge? For standby. You got to have a standby. You don'’t got a standby with that automatic oil feed? Let me tell you something. You don'’t have a stand by in that main gauge, you are fucking fucked. And you keep an eye on them, huh? What do you mean I keep an eye on them? I'’m watching them constantly, that'’s my job. I see that. Of course, I read a bit. I mean, come on, when you get right down to it, what is there to do? You got to watch two gauges four hours a clip. I mean that'’s eight hours a day watching two gauges. If you didn'’t read or do something, Jesus, you'’d go insane. Where you going? Hey? People with money want a piece of everything. They got to have a piece of everything. Now, how different is that than that Prince John? Who is that? Who? Prince John, who is that? Bad Prince John? Yeah, who is that? Who is that? Yeah. Who is that? Yeah. The sucker who fucked up Robin Hood. Prince John? Yeah. Bad Prince John? Yeah. Bad Prince John. Yeah. He fucked up Robin Hood? Yeah. Hey fuck, the past is the past. What are you gonna do, ruin your life about it? You the new man? Yeah. Are you hot? Huh? Are you hot? Oh, yeah. I'’ll put a scoop out the porthole. What'’s your name? Katzman, Dale Katzman. Katzman? Yeah. Jewish, huh? Yeah. No offense. Well, Dale, coming on like this out of nowhere, you got a thing or two to find out. Now, the main thing about the boats other than their primary importance in the steel industry is you don'’t get any pussy. You got that? Yeah. Except when we tie up. This is important to know because it precludes your whole life on the boats. This is why everyone says "fuck" all the time, huh. Why? Well, they say "fuck" in direct proportion of how bored they are, huh. Yeah. Now, for the prospect of not getting any. Do you know about sex? I know it all. I see you mean that facetiously. Yeah. Because there sure is a hell of a lot to find out. I'’m not gonna offend you, am I? Uh, I don'’t know. Okay. You know, I didn'’t find out about sex until late in life judging from my age of puberty-- You got to go on watch? No, not until ten. Oh. --which came quite early. Who can say why, huh? Yeah. Around eight. What did I know then, right? Stroke books, jacking off with a few choice friends, am I right? Yeah, you'’re right. For years until I'’m in high school and I fall for this girl. Same old story, right? She'’s beautiful, she'’s smart, and I dig her. I take her out. So times are different then. This was a few years ago and after the movies we'’re dry humping in the living room. The father is asleep upstairs, the mother'’s dead. Same old story, right? And all of a sudden the whole thing becomes clear to me. I mean, like, in a flash all this horse shit about the universe becomes clear to me and I perceive meaning in life. I wanna fuck. I wanna stick it inside her. Screw dry humping, I wanna get it wet. I wanna become one with the ages of men and women before me down into eternity and do it in the mud from whence we sprung. You know what I mean, huh? I know. And I'’m on fire and I'’m going, "Ooh, ah," like that. And I'’m trying do undo her brassiere. This girl had tits. Of course nowadays, I don'’t even bother anymore. You know what I say, you'’ll do what I say. The joy is gone, you know? So anyway, we'’re still humping and bumping and I'’m trying to undo the brassiere and my knee, as if it had a mind of its own, and never a word spoken, had inserted itself between her legs and she'’s gyrating like crazy and saying-- what do you think she'’s saying? I love you. I love you? No. She'’s saying... Oh, Fred, please don'’t. So like a dope, I don'’t. Huh? We looked sheepish for a minute. She gets all straightened up and says she'’s "had a wonderful time, Freddie," and out I go. So to make a long story short, after this happens another time, two times, I begin to get wise. Something is not as it should be. Also, I couldn'’t walk in the morning but my uncle, who is over, is conversing with me one evening, and as men will do, we start talking about sex. He tells his story, I tell my story. This takes him aback. "What?" he says. "The way to get laid is to treat them like shit." Now, you just stop for a moment and think on that. You heard it before, you'’ll hear it again, but there'’s more to it than meets the eye. Listen, the way to get laid is to treat '’em like shit. Truer words were never spoken and this has been tested by better men than you or I. So I thought it out a bit and decided to put it into action. I'’m going out with Janice. Movies, walk home, couch, dry humping. No, I hit her in the mouth. Now, I don'’t mean slapped, Dale. I mean hit. I fucking pasted her. She don'’t know nothing. She is so surprised, she don'’t even bleed. Not a word did I speak but off with her dress, her panties, and my pants. I didn'’t wear any underwear. A lot of woman find that attractive. Did you know that? No. Well, I'’ve only since found that out. So anyway, smack '’em, spread the old chops and I hump the shit out of her and she'’s yelling, "Oh, don'’t. Oh, yes. Oh, don'’t. Oh, yes. Freddie, oh, it'’s so good. Oh, shit." Bingo! So I get dressed and she'’s laying on the couch spent, I mean spent and wet and everything. She looked beautiful and I go over to the door. "Not another word out of you, cunt, ever." What about her father? He was a boilermaker. So after that, it'’s hand jobs in the assembly hall, fucking under the bleachers, the whole thing, man. She'’s buying presents and asking me to the prom. I'’d left school and to this day, I mean to this date, I want piece, I call her and tell her. Fred? Not ask her, tell daily. How did you get my number? Who is that? I tell her where and when and she'’s there, and she'’s married. It'’s that creep, Fred. Let me talk to him. Hey, you son of a bitch. I'’ve been waiting for you. Yeah. You got my wife-- So remember, I know, I know. I was a shy kid, too, but you got to remember the way to a woman'’s cunt is right through the cunt. That'’s the only way. Fershtay? Uh-huh. Let'’s get something to eat, huh? You know, I'’m gonna get a jump on this and make up the first cabin. Okay. See you later. Yes, sir. Take it out. You have a safe and pleasant journey. Thank you. Take care. W.A.Y. Chicago. W.A.Y. Chicago, this is Seaway Queen ready for departure. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, my. Okay. Okay. It'’s okay.

I don'’t know. But I had my suspicions he gave it all away. So who knows? Maybe the mafia got '’em. I mean, somebody got '’em. Maybe the whore, huh? So maybe it was the Murphy man, but I don'’t think so. It looks like the outfit. Not that they care for the few Cs they took but you know how they are. You can'’t get behind when you'’re into them. That'’s it, am I right? No, it doesn'’t figure unless it was the outfit. Ah, or some freak occurrence. It was probably some outfit guys got him. Assuming he was into them. It doesn'’t look like he just got rolled. They beat the living fuck out of him. Left him for dead, huh? Could you feature it? Flies in his face, fucking ear stuck to the sidewalk with blood. They ruptured him, man. He'’ll never perform again. They put the boots to him, left him for dead. No, it doesn'’t figure. The only way it adds up if it was the outfit. A very property-oriented group.

No. I would tell you if it were the case. I would if it were the case. It'’s a tough life. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I was married once. Yeah? Yeah. I'’m still married to my second wife. You got divorced, huh?

Used to say, "Hey, if you'’re gonna smoke, don'’t hide it. Smoke in my presence." So, did you? Christ, no, he would'’ve kicked the shit out of me. It'’s too fucking expensive.

Your company, guests come out for a trip when we'’re docked at Port Arthur and they'’re up there on the boat deck, and for an hour, hour and a half, they'’re watching the crane lift the lids off the hole. Just watching it. The dust is flying and it'’s hard to breathe, but they'’re just standing there. People got cameras. They'’re taking pictures of a crane lifting a lid. Now, what'’s so interesting about that? I'’d like to know. You describe the situation to them, to any normal people, they wouldn'’t walk across the hall to watch it if the TV were broken. But there they are, guests of the company standing on the boat deck hours on end, watching the crane lift the lids off the hole. Maybe they see something I don'’t. Maybe I'’m getting jaded. What are they looking at? Now, what are you looking at? You'’re looking at them. That'’s perfectly correct. It'’s all a matter of perspective. Yes, sir. Ever look at the wake off the fan tail? Do I ever look at the wake? Yes. I'’m sure that I have. Well, if you have, then you noticed this: The wake diverges. Diverges, mind you, but the convergence of distance, huh, is you take two lines, and in the distance, they seem to converge. They do. And so, the two effects, the wake itself diverging and the illusion of a convergence produces this, an effect whereby the lines seem to parallel out to infinity. It'’s all a matter of perspective. Bless them all, bless them all ♪ ♪ Bless the long and the short and the tall ♪ ♪ Bless all the sergeants with all of their stripes ♪ ♪ Good evening, Mr. Collins. Joe. Mr. Collins, how far is it to land out here? I don'’t know, about five miles. How long could a guy live out here, do you think? Huh? I mean, not if he was on an island or something or a boat. I mean if he was in the water. I mean, it'’s over your head. I don'’t really know, Joe. You planning a swim? Swim? Oh, a swim? Oh, I get your--no. I was just wondering, you know, in case, God forbid, the ship went down and, you know, lifeboats were all leaky or something. How long could a guy live out here? Joe. You can tell me. Don'’t worry about it, huh? Even if the boat sunk, you got your life jackets. They'’d have a helicopter here in a half an hour. I wasn'’t worried, I just wondered, you know. Yeah, well, don'’t wonder. I guess the big problem wouldn'’t be the drowning as much as the boredom, huh? I knew a guy who ate a chair just because nobody stopped him. See you, Joe. See you, Joe. Bye, Mr. Collins. Steven Seagal is the strongest guy in ten years. You know what? You are truly an idiot. You could have said that in the dark and I would'’ve known it was you because only you could make so stupid a statement. Steven Seagal has got to be the dumbest jack off I could remember. Yeah, it'’s like you to say that. You know about it. I know when a guy is strong. And that'’s what Seagal is, strong, huh? Yeah. You know, you'’re right, I agree with you 100%. He is strong, this Seagal. I can'’t think of anything that could be stronger than him unless maybe a pile of shit. What do you know? Who do you like? Oh, I'’ll tell you. You want a real strong fellow, a real type? I'’d have to say Jerry Lewis. He could probably knock the shit out of this Seagal. You don'’t know nothing. You don'’t know a fucking champ when you'’re looking at him in the movies, for Christ'’s sake. This guy is stark, he'’s the best. He'’s the best, all right, like jacking off is better than getting laid. This guy Seagal is the biggest jack off of all time. Yeah. I agree what you, Stan. I see your point. The man is not stark, he'’s no fucking good. That'’s why he didn't take five fucking guys in that ballroom using only one pool cue. I see your point. Then Shirley Temple probably couldn'’t have taken those guys, I suppose. Oh, no, Shirley probably could have taken them. She could have disarmed them and probably shot that meat knife out of the guy'’s hand from 20 feet from the hip. Yeah. I see your point. Then I suppose this guy could whip the shit out of a Clint Eastwood, huh? Explain that to me, Fred, how Clint Eastwood is no match for this guy. Oh, no. No, explain it to me. If you want to get ridiculous about it. War! Or Lee Van Cleef, I'’m sure he would have laid down and puked from fear when he'’s seen this guy two blocks off. All I know is, like you say, any guy who fucks all night and drinks a shit load of champagne and can go out at five the next morning to rob a bank without a hitch has got to be no fucking good, I see your point. No fucking good? No, he'’s great. He only had the entire National Guard full of side kicks, above 2,000 guys and an A-bomb to back him up. You really got to admire a stand up guy like that. He didn'’t have no bomb. Pardon me? And what is this bomb shit. You probably didn'’t see the movie, all you know. No, you'’re right. I probably didn'’t even see the movie. That'’s how come I don't know what a bustout Steven Seagal is and what a complete loser you are to back him. I probably never did see the picture. In fact, I probably never been to a movie in my life. I'’m not standing on a boat. Your name isn'’t Fred, I suppose. And oh, yeah, you'’re probably not completely full of shit. Probably not. You idiot. What do you know? Yeah right. See? See? That'’s the trouble with this straight shift crap. Get up. Come upstreet. What? I said that'’s the trouble with this straight shift crap. Come on. Get out of bed and come on up with us. I got to sleep. What? How can you sleep in this heat? What are you gonna-- Come on. Joe, I got to sleep, man. You can'’t. You can'’t sleep in this. If you can sleep in this shit, you are a drowsy motherfucker. Get up. O-o-o-oh. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Some clothes? Sure. So, where are you from? Chicago. Oh, you came here on the boat? Seaway Queen. Seaway Queen. Huh. House of steel, right? Joseph Chovetski, 1939. He led that keel 640 feet. Chovetski steel, sold. House of steel 1950-something. Huh? Sure. Pretty good. Nothing good about it. So, what do you need? Hm, you need something. And I'’m Dale, who knows why, just by accident. But you know something? I know that this voice is the same voice from that [foreign word] that'’s been plaguing my daughter. And all he said-- You look like a stalker-- all he said was the number of a doctor or something but I know sure as I'’m standing here right now that this is the same [foreign word], that cock sucker that'’s been making calls to her. How did you know it was the same guy? Well, from the voice. What do I need, a program? I haul him from that phone booth, you know, and [foreign word], you know, trust me. Anyway, you'’re finished. I take him from the booth and I give him such a [foreign word]. I give him a--smack him, I smack him. Give him a... Did you kill him? You need a pair of gloves? Did I kill him? Huh, I don'’t know. And did the phone calls continue? That'’s the funny part. Not two days later. Anybody pick up the mail? Fine day today. Fine day. And up the streets? Uh, yeah. So, we'’re leaving on time, right?

He carries this belly pistol, black as night in his sleeve. In his fucking sleeve! He goes "whomp" like that and the fucking thing slides down his sleeve into his fucking hand. And you see the guy has still got his hand up the throat, but all you see is this little bit of bloody handle. You see, Steven Seagal shot the fucking cleaver out of the guy'’s hand behind his back, 20, 30 feet with a two-inch belly pistol. All duty orders report... Now, how stark is that? All duty orders report to the... Very impressive. You'’re not just saying that? No. Good morning, Skip. Good morning. Good morning, sir. Good morning to you, sir. What have we of interest for the deck this morning? Nothing to report, sir. Fine is kind. It'’s a big black Colt revolver, a .38 or a .44 pure blue-black with a black checkered grip and an eyelet on the butt you can use for a lanyard. It was an old gun but it was in good shape, no scratches. Pure black like a good pair of boots, you know. It must have been re-blued or maybe he just never used it, you don'’t know. Used big shells, too--powerful. You could tell by how big they were. It'’s a good way to tell. No, I was in the army, you know, overseas, Hawaii. And all the officers, they had, uh, they had pistols, they had automatics, you know, .45s, big heavy guns, but his gun was a revolver. I'’ve seen it. Shit, he used to come down here to clean it. He used to work down here for a while and that'’s why I don'’t understand how they ever took him '’cause as tough a guy as Guigliani was, I don'’t know how they ever took him. They must--they must have took him from behind or drugged him or something. Yeah, I heard they might have drugged him. Bastards. Or he was drunk. Possible, very possible. That is--that'’s the-- He used to drink. He used to drink on the ship. Hey, who doesn'’t? Not him. Not him for sure. He staggered around like an Indian after he had a few. Like a fucking Potawatomi he would. Yup. And that'’s probably what happened. Did he have his gun with him? Why, what'’d you hear? I didn'’t hear one way or the other. All right, well, what I heard was that he had the gun with him when he went to the bar but when they found him... Yeah. ...he didn'’t have it on him. Huh. Yeah. He was a mysterious fellow. Huh. He had a lot of gumption. I heard that. I didn'’t know him. Lot of gall. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I hated that. I mean, what'’s he know, you know? Blindballs us all. Damn fool. Like to get killed, crazy with a big gun like that. Maybe he didn'’t have it on. No, he had it. I think he had it, by God.

I mean for his sake, I hope he'’s got it." Yeah, but whether he took it or not, they got him. Yeah, I know. Fucking cops. Yeah. Why do you say cops? Come here. It was the cops that got him. Yeah, or uncle Sam, the G. The G? What would the G want with Guigliani? Are you kidding? What that kid knew. What did he know? Things, he knew things. Huh? Yeah. Sure in hell that kid, he let on like he didn'’t know. But see, I knew that he knew. I know when they know, I can see it, huh? And he--he'’d been around, that kid, he was no dumb kid. The cops know that, they don'’t sit still. They know, you know. He was no cherry, that kid. He was no dumb kid. You know what I think? I think he was on the run and I think they wanted him. The Coast Guard wouldn'’t let him on the boats if he was wanted. I mean, they print you. You know that. Still. How could he get on? He had friends. Okay? Friends. Powerful, with strengths.

I don'’t know but not counting it, he got 3600 bucks. That'’s 1800 bucks a finger. The main winch, which fingers? The right hand, these two. Fuck. He'’s crippled. Two fingers? Yeah, but the thumb. What about it for 3600? How can he pick anything up? Use the other fucking hand. If they paid him five dollars every time he wanted to pick something up, just to use his left hand, he'’d get 3600 bucks for 720 times. Hey. That'’s not so much. I wouldn'’t do it. Well, he didn'’t do it on purpose. I wouldn'’t do it at all even by accident. No amount of money. I think. You can'’t buy a finger, man. It'’s gone and that's it. Not for all the money in the world.

Want to know how to get marks off stainless steel. Ever think of a trick? A trick is something that you'’re told it, and then you can do it. There'’s nothing to it, it'’s a trick. The trick gets marks off stainless steel. You clean it, then go over it with a rag with boiling water. You'’ll remember I told you that. I will, sir. You get paid for doing a job. You get paid for doing a job. You trade your work for money. Am I right? Why is it any less good than being a doctor, for example? That'’s one thing I never wanted to be. I wanted to be a lot of things when I was little. I wanted to be a ballplayer like everybody else. I wanted to be a cop. Eh, what'’s a kid know, right? Can I tell you one thing I wanted to be? I know this is gonna sound peculiar, but it was a pure desire on my part. One thing I wanted to be when I was little, I don'’t mean to be bragging now, just to be saying it, if you were there, you would have known, it was pure desire on my part. I wanted to be a dancer. That'’s something I guard like, you know, you guard the first time you got laid, or the girl you'’re in love with or winning a bike at the movies. Well, maybe not that but... you know, more like getting married or winning a medal in the war. I wanted to be a dancer. Not tap, I mean a real ballet dancer. I know they'’re all fags but, yeah, I didn'’t think about it. Well, I didn'’t not think about it, I mean, I didn'’t say, "Well, I want to be a dancer but I do not want to be a fag," you know, it'’s--you know, it wasn'’t important. I could see myself arriving at the theater late doing Swan Lake at the Lyric Opera, wearing this coat with a old fashion collar, you know, and it'’s winter. I'’m entering the theater with this purple shirt, white tights, leading my girls. Yeah, beautiful little girls. Sweating, all my muscles are covered in sweat, you know, but it'’s clean, and my muscles all feel tight, every fucking muscle in my body, hundreds of them, tight and working, standing on stage straight with this sort of expression on my face waiting to catch this girl who'’s about 15. Takes a hell a lot of work to be a dancer but a fucking dancer doesn'’t even care. Doesn'’t even have to be somebody because he is somebody. So much so, it'’s not important. You know I mean? Did you ever try to... I don'’t want to get you offended by this. You don'’t have to answer this if you don'’t want. No. Go ahead. Well, what the fuck, if you'’re gonna talk, I mean, really, why fuck around the bush, huh? Did you ever try to kill yourself? No. I did, one time. Yeah, I should say, I--perhaps, I shouldn'’t say, I tried to kill myself, meaning the gun didn'’t work, but I wanted to. Yeah. I had this gun when I lived over on the South Side. I won it in a poker game. Yeah. Eh. I bought it off the bumboat in Duluth. Why lie, 40 bucks. Was a revolver, .32 revolver, six shots, you know. How big a barrel? Hmm, like this, couple inches. I never fired it. One time, coming back, I loaded the gun, I shot one shot off the fantail into the water. I didn'’t hit anything. I used to clean it. I got this kit in the mail, patches and oil and gun slick and powder solvent and this fucking brush, you know. I seen them. I kept it in my suitcase. One night in Gary, I had this apartment. I was cleaning the gun and, you know, how you do pretending the cops are chasing me and doing fast draws in the mirror. And then I said, "What are you doing?" A grown man playing bang, bang in some fucking dive in Gary, Indiana, ten o'’clock at night, and I laid down in front of the TV and I loaded the gun, five chambers. You don'’t load the sixth in case you jiggle on your horse and you blow your foot off. And I put the end in my mouth. And I couldn'’t swallow. I felt my pulse start to beat and my balls contract and pull up. Did you ever feel that? No. And I took it out of my mouth. I laid down on the bed on my back, looked at the ceiling. I stuck the gun under my chin pointing at my brain. And after a while I started feeling real stupid. I rolled over and I put my gun under my pillow but I held onto it, you know. And I started to, you know, play with myself. You know what I mean? I know. Grown man. Isn'’t that something? Hm. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Mr. Collins? Sir? Mail boat come by? Yes, sir. We get that report on, uh...
