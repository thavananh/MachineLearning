foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- [MUSIC PLAYING] You work too hard, Jonathan. Yeah, well, this place is too big for one, right? Well, we talked about hiring Willy Millichick. I'm talking family. Are you talking about Aaron? Look at that, Mary. I wish you could tell me what Aaron finds so all-fired wonderful about Chicago. Why don't you ask him? He don't even write. [WATER SPLASHES] Do you? [MUSIC PLAYING] Drink up. Nick, and Edie, and the gang are waiting for us at the restaurant. They have a swell new band. Aaron? Hello, Aaron? You hear one word of what I just said? Yes, you said Nick and Edie, the restaurant, and the new band. You love dancing. What's eating you? That factory got you down? Nah, that's no life. WOMAN: Bad news? No, my brother. Have you ever lived on a farm? Hmm, that'll be the day. Come on. Now let's skedaddle. Hmm, it's Jonathan. He says spring is early this year. And we're late. We're keeping Nick and Edie waiting. They won't miss us. They're my best friends. [SIGHS] Aren't you a little fed up with friends like that? I'll tell you who I'm fed up with. When you change your mind, you know where to find me. AARON: [WHISTLING] [GASPS] Aaron! Aaron! [LAUGHS] I can't believe you're home. Jonathan! Aaron's home! That's the best meal I ever paid for. Do you know what this is? AARON: Black Angus. [LAUGHS] Well, he's still a farmer all right. Well, hell, it says so right on top. [LAUGHS] Look here. They got the figures right here. The whole country is getting more and more beef all the time. Now, somebody's got to raise that beef. I'm going to get us a bull, the best, at the cattle exposition in Kansas City-- start up a herd. What do you think? Sounds fine. Let's do it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] [CHILDREN LAUGHING] [LAUGHS] It hardly seemed possible, Mary, that your little cousin Katherine here could be old enough to be a bride yet. [LAUGHS] She's grown up since you left us. Katherine, I'm so happy for you. Thank you. [LAUGHS] And you, Mike, congratulations. Thank you, Mary. The way you never miss a Sunday, Jonathan Gray-- you're either powerful good, or powerful wicked, [LAUGHS] needing that much time in church. How come you're here, Doc? The women of Moran County delivering their own babies without you and your automobile to hell? Hey, Doc. Kate's ma's going to have her baby anytime now. Must be why Kate came to church alone. Kate came alone because Aaron came. That brother-in-law of yours will be next. Hello. Look at him. That boy's got the same spunk as your pa. Aaron! Yes, you, boy-- Aaron Gray. You better get a move on. Still giving orders, Aunt Mabel? MABEL: Still talking sense, you mean. You're lucky that, while you were off in Chicago, that little girl of yours didn't get hitched up. She waited. Now, you going to keep her waiting, or you going to take her home? [ENGINE REVS] [CHATTER] [HORN HONKS] [LAUGHS] Do it again, Doc. Get a horse, Doc! They're waiting, Jonathan. We'll get to dance. [LAUGHS] Chicago's too changed for you. Yes. I gave up chewing tobacco. [LAUGHS] You never did chew tobacco. But you do got some flirty city ways about you. So you noticed. Some girls are partial to that sort of thing. I don't happen to be. [LAUGHS] All grown up with a mind of your own, eh? Hey! Hey! Ma's having the baby! You get down to the barn and stay there. Do I gotta? I'm going with both of y'all. AGNES VOLENCE: [MOANING] Daddy, I want to stay with Mama. She just don't want me here if Ma starts yelling. I'll build you a swing. OK. How you doing, Willy? Son, you doing OK? [DOOR CREAKS] I wonder if Agnes has had her baby. I wouldn't know. Well, I'm going to bed. Don't be long. I won't. [DOOR CREAKS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Seven years, Lord, seven years. Mary's in there praying the same prayer-- that the art of love making's going to bring us baby, but it won't. You know that. But there's a page here, Lord-- your words. It says right here, in the Bible, take unto thee Aaron and his sons. Now, I can't have sons, but my brother can. Now, I've been praying for this all winter, and now he's home. Before he marries Kate and starts a family of his own, I'm-- is what I'm thinking such a terrible sin? Mama had a boy. You got a baby brother, Newt. Happy? Go back to sleep. How are they doing? They're fine. Oh, you should see him Mom and Papa. I guess there's no other time when two human beings feel any closer. [SIGHS] Thanks for staying, Aaron. Well, I couldn't very well run off without knowing whether it was a boy or girl, could I? Which would you rather have, Aaron-- boy or a girl? What difference does it make? Things like that matter to a woman. And she'd like to think they matter to her man, too. Meaning I'm your man? Are you, Aaron? Don't push me, Kate. Oh, Kate. I know what you want. What do I want, Aaron? Oh, god, girl, you want me to marry you. And I should be asking right now. It's just that I'm not ready to get tied down yet. You know, people-- [GASPS] people got us marching down the aisle before we even gotten used to the changes in each other. You know what I'm saying? No. I'm scarcely back, and you heard Aunt Mabel. I can't even see you without us taking vows. I never said that. No, you didn't. But everyone else did. [SIGHS] They know I've been waiting for you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yes, I know, Kate. I want you to. [GASPS] Just because I want to marry you doesn't give you the right to act like we're already married. Maybe if you quit trying to push me into marriage and gave your body what it's panting for. [HAND SLAPS] [LAUGHS] I'm sorry, Kate. It's just that a man has-- well, physical needs. Well, then, you take them back to your little chippies in Chicago. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] [CLANKING] [CLANK] [SIGHS] Aaron? You all right? What are you doing up? Well, I couldn't sleep for wondering about Agnes. Everything all right down there? It's fine. The baby's a boy. [GASPS] A boy. Took a long time, did it? [SIGHS] Aaron, tell me about it. You best let Agnes or Kate do the telling. They know more about it than I. Mary, girl, I think I've just made a real ass of myself tonight. I hurt Kate tonight on purpose. I never thought I'd do that. You sure all the blame's yours? Usually takes two to anger. Takes two to do a lot of things. She wants to get married. Shoot, I just gotten back. I'm not ready. She's expecting more than a walk in the moonlight. Maybe I expect more, too. That's what you fought over then? Women don't understand. Sometimes, a man's needs can sometimes be bigger than his common sense. Why is it they have such a hard time understanding that? Is it because a woman's needs are so different? A woman's needs aren't all that different. I think people want pretty much the same thing-- marriage, and love, and children. It's women who put them in that order. MARY GRAY: Well, that's how they are, usually. What about Kate? Think it's easy on her? Who's side you on? [LAUGHS] Nobody's side. Just like to see you and Kate happy. Maybe there is something you don't understand. It's what happens to a woman when another woman has a baby. It's like nature plays a trick on her. Makes her think of it as her own. You hear the news, and you hear about the heartbeat, and-- might as well be beating inside yourself. The birth-- well, you're sharing that, too. Just see a newborn child is to want one of your own-- [SIGHS] whether you have 12 or two. Sorry for going on about myself like that. I should be talking to Jonathan about this. He's not much for talking, though, is he? Boy, if the old biddies in town could hear us going on like this. [LAUGHS] Choke in their sleep. [LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [ROOSTER CROWS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Aaron, brother, I have something to ask-- something I have to talk to you about. [SIGHS] Wish it would be as easy to say as what we're doing right now-- working together. How else am I going to say it but straight out? No other way-- say it at supper tonight. Amen. [GASPS] I'll have to go visit Agnes and the new baby as soon as it's respectable-- maybe the end of the week. You wouldn't be planning to do a little matchmaking now, would you? MARY GRAY: It's only common politeness to go visit the new parents. Huh. Agnes will still be in bed, but-- is something wrong, Jonathan? Just that everybody's having children except us. Excuse me. No, I want you to listen. I got something to say, and it's for both of you. We've been married seven years now, and that's a long time. And there's still no babies. This is between you two. I got no place in this. Aaron, I told Mary all about when I got the mumps when we were boys and how they left me. So we all know that I can't father children. We don't know that for sure, Jonathan. I mean, Doc Haymes has me counting the days. And I haven't given up hope. Well, I have given up hope, Mary. And you're just fooling yourself if you listen to that old quack and go on hoping anymore. There's no call to hurt her. This place needs children, and they're not going to spring from me. But you, Aaron-- they could spring from you. You see, you're the natural one. You're my brother. Now, surely you see how there ought to be a child around here. I'm getting pretty damn tired of everybody in five counties pushing me to get married. I'm not talking about you and Kate. Well, what the hell are you talking about? I said, what the hell are you talking about? I'm talking about you and Mary. [GASPS] Now, before either of you say anything, I-- There's nothing to say. Gee, there's nothing between Mary and me. She's your wife, man. Look at her. You see what you're doing? Mary, I want us to have a son. I know I'm not handy with words. But all winter long, I've been thinking about this, praying for it. Now, if it's a sin, I'll gladly take that sin onto myself. But like Aaron says, there's nothing between you two. And the sin is in what the Bible calls coveting. [FIST BANGS] Just shut up. Keep the Bible out of this and stop trying to twist and bend the words to make it sound right. I said I'd accept the blame. You'll accept nothing, because there'll be nothing to accept-- no sin, no baby, no blame. Can you just see Mary showing up at church with a bastard in her arms? I'd call it mine. It wouldn't be no bastard. The bastard here is you. Stop it, both of you. Not one more word. Mary, you ought to have a chance for a baby. [SIGHS] Now, there's nobody else I'd ask, but Aaron's my brother. [SIGHS] We're not animals, Jonathan. There has to be love. [SIGHING] I'm sorry, Mary. I had no part in this. I said it all wrong, I know. [SIGHS] [DOOR SQUEAKS] [DOOR BANGS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] Where did you go? Mary? You gave me a scare being gone for so long. Didn't think you'd miss me. I said it all wrong, I know. [SIGHS] Doesn't matter how you said it, only matters that you did. There's no good way to say something like that. JONATHAN GRAY: You don't see that it's something I want for you, too. Mary, I see you going on, year after year, still looking like a child yourself. And everybody else has got more kids than they need. You had no right. You know all my plans for this place. I'm always working. I'm working at something better to pass on to a son. I was proud of those plans. I was proud to share them with you. But this plan-- there's no sharing it, not you and me. So are you sorry you're here with me? [SIGHS] I'm not sorry I'm here with you. I'm only sorry about this obsession you have with a baby. [ROOSTER CROWS] Morning, Aaron. Morning, Jonathan. Breakfast is piping hot. Just coffee for me. We're going to go see Agnes and the baby tonight, Aaron. Are you coming with us? I reckon so. He's going to want to see Kate. I think I'll get the smell of winter out of the house, start with the front room. Thanks. Come in. You and Mary-- - Ma'am. - --it's good to see you. - That's for you. - John. - I'm so happy to-- - Aaron. - --see you. - Yes. - It's good to see you. - Well, you look wonderful. - Well, thank you. - Are you feeling all right? I feel wonderful. [LAUGHS] What's his name? James, but we're going to call him Jimmy while he's little. This cake of yours calls for some dandelion wine. Cora, would you get some plates, please, honey? Have a seat. Oh, he's beautiful. He smells so good. Would you like to hold him? Yes. By the time you've had your sixth one, you're too glad to have someone else do the holding for a change. [BABY WHIMPERS] Excuse me. I have some work to do. [LAUGHS] Plans I had last year-- Cora? We have to share. --I made them for till the last of May. You know, I don't know if we're going to get ours in by the end of May or not, Clem. But if not, Mary can give Aaron a hand. See, I got to take the train down to Kansas City come the end of May for the cattle exposition. [BABY WHIMPERS] I didn't know you meant to go yourself to Kansas City. Well, we talked about buying the bull. That was before-- CHILD 1: Ow, hey. CHILD 2: You deserved it. CHILD 1: Stop it. [LAUGHS] Kate, we have to talk. CHILD 2: Look. [LAUGHS] How long you're going to keep this up? I don't want to speak to you or see you ever again. Well, turn around and look at me when you say that. Be the same if I was looking at you or not. Can we go outside and talk this over like two adults? No. I'm going to help Mama put the kids to bed. Fine, have it your way. I'll come down and get you for the dance tomorrow night. I'm going to the dance with Tony Halek. CHILD 1: Stop it. [MUSIC PLAYING] He really means to go then. Looks that way. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'll have to stay. The place can't run itself. But honest to god, Mary, girl, I'd never lay a hand on you. For all our sakes, it will be best if I leave when he gets back. But until then, nothing's going to happen. I swear. You don't even have to say that. Friends? Friends. Dare I ask? What, about me and Kate? [LAUGHS] No, about Alice Roosevelt or Alice Blue-- [LAUGHS] She's making noises about going to the dance tomorrow night with Tony Halek, but she'll come around. [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHS] You looking forward to tonight, Aaron? I think you should teach Kate some of those fancy dances you learned in Chicago. You go, and I'll wash up upstairs. [MUSIC PLAYING] Aaron. [WHISTLES] [LAUGHS] Could you get this button for me? [EXHALES] She won't be able to resist you. [LAUGHS] JONATHAN GRAY: Aaron, come give me a hand with this tub? What's wrong with your hand? AARON GRAY: Nothing. What, did you get soft in the city? Mary, put some of that ointment you got on Aaron's hand. Nah, it's fine. That'll fix him up in no time. I'll be dressed in a minute. I'll hitch up the wagons. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER, LAUGHTER] Yeah, let me have a beer. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER, LAUGHTER] - Have you seen Aaron? - What? It's so loud in here. Aaron-- have you seen him? Ah, there he is. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER, LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello. Are you having a good time, Aaron? Sure. Why don't you ask your pretty little wife to dance, Jonathan? Oh, no, Mable. You know I'm no dancer. - Oh. [LAUGHS] You sure look pretty tonight, Mary. [APPLAUSE] [CHATTER] Do you mind if I ask your date for a dance? As long as it's not the last one. Do you want to dance with me? Not with you, Aaron Gray. Sorry. Time for the the dance! WOMAN: Oh! [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] [CHATTER, LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Marta Goothagen made the apple pie. [CLAPPING] This is the last waltz. Take your partners, ladies and gentlemen. Where's Jonathan? This is the last dance. How would I know? Well, Mary, I leave you in equally good hands. [MUSIC PLAYING] Do you want to dance? Yes. [MUSIC PLAYING] You look beautiful tonight. [MUSIC PLAYING] And eat these sandwiches while they're fresh, Jonathan. I will. Don't worry about anything here. I won't. Take care. [TRAIN WHISTLES] [MUSIC PLAYING] Ready? [MUSIC PLAYING] You wanted to go by the store, didn't you? Yes, I have my shopping list somewhere. [MUSIC PLAYING] I had some water heated for you. That's all right. Oh, you made tea. You like it best. You know a lot about me, don't you? When I first came here, Jonathan seemed to straddle around this house. I was so proud to be Jonathan's wife. Marriage should be built on more than pride. What about love? Jonathan and I have that, too. You're very different, you and Jonathan-- it strikes me, that is. Either of you were to choose a friend, you wouldn't choose each other. Yet you chose to marry. You don't have to be friends and playmates to fall in love. No, but it makes it more fun. I didn't need fun. I needed security. My father died. Well, I couldn't live with Aunt Mabel forever. I don't know. I just never thought of my husband as a playmate. I still don't. You've always had me for that. Jonathan's put an end to that though, hasn't he? I hope not. Mary, girl, I find it harder and harder to be only your friend. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [FOOTSTEPS CREAKING] [KNOCKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] May I come in? You wear those in the city? They're called pajamas. Why don't you take your hair down? I've never seen you with your braid out. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SHUDDERING BREATHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Thought I could keep from coming to you. It's wrong, Aaron. [GASPS] [SIGHS] Hello, Mary, girl. [EXHALES] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPS] Please turn out the light. You're so beautiful, Mary-- your skin and the way you look. Turn it out. Don't be afraid. I am. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GASPS] [MUSIC PLAYING] [ROOSTER CROWS] [MUSIC PLAYING] I like your hair about you. Let's go to work. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SHRIEKS] [YELLING] [GASPS] [PANTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Not here. Can we go to your room? Sure. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHS] I've never drunk wine in a bedroom before. What about Jonathan? Yes, what about Jonathan who threw you at my feet? Doesn't escuse what I'm doing to him. Let's not make excuses. [MUSIC PLAYING] [THUNDER RUMBLES] [RAIN PATTERS] My mother's wedding dress. [SIGHS] I want to see it on you. Oh, Aaron, I couldn't. Do it for me. [LAUGHS] All right, but only if you put on your father's jacket. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKING] Jonathan-- he's hired a horse. Whatever happens, just remember that I love you. [GASPING] How was your trip? Successful. You found the Black Angus. Did you like him? Not only liked him, but bought one. Coming by train at the end of the week. All right. You better get it before you catch your death. I'll take care of the horse. You poor thing. You must be soaked clear through. How was your trip? It was fine. I, uh-- I hung up some dry clothes for you. Thanks, Mary. Well, I bought the bull. Oh, you should see him, Mary. He's a real beauty. I got some brochures for you. You can read up about him. Oh, good. Here. [SNIFFS] [SNEEZES] Bless you. Must have caught a chill. Maybe you should just go to bed. Yeah, might be best. I'm tired. I'll, uh-- I'll fill the bed warmer for you. I have some comphorated oil. 1,500 pounds, huh? Oh, no, no. I got it, Mary. Thank you. This will warm you up. Thank you. It's good to be back in my own bed. I finished the hoeing. But today, we didn't get much done, what with the rain and all. That's all right. Goodnight, Aaron. Goodnight, Jonathan. [SNIFFS] What's it-- uh-huh. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ain't he a beauty? Sure is. Registered name is vindicated. A mighty fancy name for a fellow like you though, huh? Why don't we call you Vinny? How about that? Would you like that? Come on, Vinny. Lady's waiting on you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sure proud of Vinny, isn't he? Sounds like a child's name. I was praying just now, Vinny-- praying for all of us and what this place can be. That means praying that this good weather holds so I can cut hay for you, praying for Mary and Aaron. Well, I brought them together. So if there's a baby, I've got no right to complain. [MUSIC PLAYING] [ROOSTER CROWS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Mary, is dinner ready? [MUSIC PLAYING] Mary, where are you? Mary? Mary! Mary? Mary? Mary? [SIGHS] I think I'm pregnant. [MUSIC PLAYING] Aaron. Are you all right, or not? Yes. This is the last time we're going to talk about this. Mary, girl. Let me finish. I'm going to promise him that it will never happen again between me and you. And I'm going to try, with all my might, to keep that promise. You can't mean it. I have to mean it. There are other places we can live. There's no place. The hell there isn't. We knew this when we started. Everything has changed. I'm Jonathan's wife. It's my child. At his request. What, are you saying that you made love with me because he asked you to? I'm pregnant because I love you, not because of what he said. But my life is with Jonathan. My baby-- I'm asking about my baby. Don't. It's my life you're carrying, and you're saying you want to give it away to another man. Not just another man-- your brother. My brother be damned. We can go somewhere else. We can live anywhere. You tried the city. You hated it. This farm is where your life is. This is where my life is. [SIGHING] [CHATTER] [LAUGHTER] [CHATTER] [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHTER] [CHATTER] [LAUGHTER] [CHATTER] [CHILDREN CHATTERING] [LAUGHTER] Those boys are going to come thundering in here like hungry buffalo. Lord, yeah. Oh, it's hot in here. Oh. Yes, it is. You feeling all right? I'm fine. Don't you story to me, girl. Is this a dizzy spell? I asked you a question, Mary. Always happened to me when I was first pregnant-- dizzy spells. MABEL: Mary? I told her. I told her right out, Mary, you're putting on weight. Couldn't be you're pregnant at last, could it? Well, Aunt Mabel, I do believe I could be. WOMAN: [LAUGHS] The good Lord's been holding out on her long enough. WOMAN: Oh, goodness. Damn sight time he came around. What do you think you're made of, anyway? Give that to me. You got to take it easy, girl. I'm fine. You talk to Doc Haymes yet? No, not yet. Well, I had my six with no doctor badgering and prodding, but Haymes is a good man. You go see him. And you do what he says. Put that down. All right, ladies, come on. Let's go. [RINGING] MAN: Yeah, I think so. Couple more wagon wheels in there momentarily. Yeah. WOMAN 1: Here you go. MAN: Can you give me that squash? WOMAN 1: Very good. MAN: Thank you. WOMAN 1: Here's some more. Jonathan, you and Aaron going back again this year to Nebraska for the harvesting? Yeah, old man Gesner wants us for about a month in October. Yeah, of course, the money is good. But I hear tell Gesner don't feed like this. Mary, I need some more spuds down here. Ease up on Mary, old man. That goes for the rest of you boys, too. You couldn't see it unless it hit you in the forehead with a two-by-four. See what? MAN: You mean that Mary's-- MABEL: That's right. Mary's going to have a baby. [LAUGHTER] Took you a while, Jonathan, but better late than never. MAN: Jonathan, I suppose you want a boy, huh, Jonathan? Yeah, sure thing. [CHATTER] [LAUGHTER] Thank you. Eddie. Goodnight, Jonathan. Thank you. Bye bye. Mable, Uncle Garner's waiting. Let him wait. I heard Jonathan say he and Aaron might be going to hire out in Nebraska again this year. That worry you, being alone in your condition? I'm not worried. I just dread the loneliness of my head in here. Yeah. It ain't easy being without your man. Something bothering you, child? No, I'm just tired. You ain't talked about the baby. I know why-- comes from being scared, like we all are when it's our first one. It's only natural you being a little blue. Don't worry. It won't last. Chin up, girl. Time will pass before you know it. GARNER: Mable. Who's this sweaty old partner? You coming, woman, or not? Lordy, do you need a bath. Ooh-ee. Come on, old man. Ha ha. [LAUGHS] Bye, Mary. Bye. Thanks. With the money that I earn at the harvest in Nebraska, I figure I can buy us an Angus cow. We can start a herd come spring. Can we talk about something important just this once? Well, this is important, Mary. It's for the baby. Yes, the baby. Well, what is it you want me to say? Whatever you want. Say anything. All right, I'm happy about the baby. How can you be? Because the good Lord saw fit to bless us-- Not the Lord. Aaron and me. It's done. Do we have to talk about that? Unless you have some other way of showing me how you feel. What do you want from me? I want some reaction. I want to know that you care. You're my husband. Talk to me. It's what I wanted. It'll be ours. I'll be-- no one will question that I'm the father. [SIGHS] It's all right, Mary. [SIGHS] It'll be all right. Time will go by fast. You'll see. Take care, Mary. Mary? Take care. Come on, Jonathan. So long, Mary. Hee-yah. So long, Mary. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SNIFFS] [SIGHS] [SNIFFS] [GASPS] Maybe this time we spend alone together, we'll get to know each other. [SOBS] I'm sorry. I don't usually cry. MAN: Bring around over here now. Keep it coming. [CHATTER] MAN: [SINGING] Whoa. [LAUGHS] Jonathan, you want in? MAN 1: [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHS] MAN 2: No. [INTERPOSING VOICES] MAN 2: A little too rich for my blood. I'm out. I'll have to call it. MAN 1: Cheap, ah. [INTERPOSING VOICES] MAN 3: Was hoping you wouldn't do that. [INTERPOSING VOICES] MAN 3: You and your finger-licking share. Oh, Jonathan. You'll never know how many times I've asked God to tell me what to do. Were Aaron and I thinking? He's trying so hard not to. Oh, why did you have to say it? [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Aaron? Are you awake? Yep. Seems we've got some things to settle between us. I figured this was coming. You did? What took you so long getting around to it? Well, I figured it'd sort itself out-- didn't, though, till now. Did Mary say something in the letter? We didn't intend it, Jonathan. It just happened, that's all. [SIGHS] I'm sorry. Yeah, I am, too. I thought I wouldn't be, but I am. Can't say I'm not happy about that baby, though. I guess I got to thank you for that. Well, if I was married to her, I'd kill any man that laid a hand on her. You love her then. I love her. I can't deny it. What about you and Kate? [LAUGHS] That's over. What, you don't intend to patch it up with her? It just doesn't measure up anymore. Mary's your wife, man. You should know that she's not a woman that-- damn it, man. What about Mary? Does she love you, too? That's for you to ask her, her to say. What did she say in the letter? She says that there'll be nothing more between you two, and that we'll say that the baby is mine, and you'll see that things will work out that way. Well, let me see the letter. No. It's to me, not you. How do I know you're not lying? Because I'm your brother. Let me see the letter. All right, big brother. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] MAN: Hello, up there. Holy cow. Hey. Hey, come on, guys. [GROWLS] [GRUNTS] [GROWLS] [GRUNTS] [GASPS] [GRUNTS] What do I do? Kill you? So do I kill you? MARY GRAY (VOICEOVER): What happened between me and Aaron will not be again. He and I have made a sort of peace. Now the two of you must do the same. I have told Aaron that I'll stay faithful to you from now on. He knows, too, that the baby will be yours. There's no other way. We all have to find peace for the life to come. You and I will start over, Jonathan. Aaron has to start building a life of his own. I pray, Jonathan, for my sake, but mostly for yours and Aaron's. Don't let me add this to my guilt that I tore you apart forever. I know Mary. She means it about the baby. You don't ever know the truth from me. [SNIFFS] [GASPS] MAN: Climb up there. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Here, stash that for me, Joe. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: [SINGING] Take care of yourself. [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: [SINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: (SINGING) ever go home, there's no place-- Well, I think so. MAN: (SINGING) --like home. [DOG BARKING] [HORSE WHINNIES] [DOG BARKING] [GASPS] - Hello. - [GASPS] Hi, Mary. How you doing, Mary, girl? I'm home! How's the little one? I'm fine. You can feel it moving. Really? MAN: Hey, John. Move along. Where's Aaron? Gesner asked him to stay on for a couple weeks. Come on inside, Mary, girl. You're going to catch your death out here. It's good to be home. [SIGHS] Guess I wore out another hat. Mary? Mm-hmm. I had that talk with Aaron, like you said. Everything is all right between us. Why isn't he here? Don't do that, Jonathan. [SIGHS] Didn't I promise you in my letter that there would be no more between Aaron and me? [SIGHS] You going to look at me like this every time I mention his name? He's your brother. This is his house, too. I want to know. He said he'd be home for Christmas. To stay? I don't know. I'll get dinner ready. You can tell me about Nebraska. Nebraska was lonely. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Winter's coming. But we'll do fine, Vinnie. Brought home some money to buy you a misses. What do you think of that? AARON GRAY: Merry Christmas. [GASPS] [GASPS] Aaron! [LAUGHS] Well, why didn't you write and let us know that you were coming so Jonathan could pick you up? What, and spoil a good surprise? Well, look at you, pretty as ever-- prettier. How are you doing? Wonderful. What did you bring? Dirty laundry. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] Stop that. [MUSIC PLAYING] Jonathan! Jonathan, Aaron's home! Hmm, from Aunt Mabel. [LAUGHS] Hey, thanks. [LAUGHS] [PLAYING HARMONICA] Jonathan. [GASPS] It's your old cradle. [LAUGHS] Aaron's, too. Thank you. Thank you both. Now maybe Aaron will show you what he bought you. Yes. I am so curious. Oh. Oh. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] Well? [GASPS] What is it? [LAUGHS] It's a graphophone. A graphophone. A graphophone. [MUSIC PLAYING] The last waltz. Why don't you dance with Aaron? You know I'm not much for it. [MUSIC PLAYING] May I have the pleasure of this dance? [LAUGHS] Certainly, sir. [MUSIC PLAYING] It was a wonderful Christmas. Good night, Aaron. Goodnight, Aaron. Merry Christmas. More snow. It's looking really bad out there. You know, you are such a worrier, Aaron. Maybe I should go get Doc Haymes, just in case. Everyone says the first one takes a while in coming. Well, at least I can get Aunt Mable. When I need her. You sure, Mary? [SIGHS] Will you two calm down? I'll let you know. [GASPS] Oh. [GASPS] Jonathan! [BELL RINGING] Aaron! [GASPS] JONATHAN GRAY: Whoa. Doc Haymes is over in Douglas County. It's just as well. You're not supposed to be moving. It's your Aunt Mable, Mary! You're going to be fine! Give me a stack of newspapers, Jonathan, and some straps. And bring a couple of bowls of hot water. I'm coming, Mary! [GROANING] Easy. [GROANING] I know. Come on, now. I've got to get at the bed. [GASPS] [BREATHES HEAVILY] You'll be glad of these when the time comes. [MUSIC PLAYING] MABEL: Jonathan? Congratulations, Jonathan. It's a girl. A girl? Is she-- is she-- is she-- are they all right? Fit as a fiddle, both of them. Here, go ahead. Hold her. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHS] MABEL: Let Mary sleep now. Where's that coffee? [GASPS] Oh, that's better. Congratulations, Aaron. You're an uncle. Now, get me home before the storm gets any worse. Looks like we're in for it. JONATHAN GRAY: Aaron? Aaron! What's wrong? JONATHAN GRAY: She's not well. [GASPS] Fever. Here. Aaron, you hold Sarah. I'll get some cold cloths. Sarah? Sarah, for my grandmother. AARON GRAY: Sarah. [BABY WHIMPERING] Do you think the baby should be near her? [BABY WHIMPERING] Jonathan, after Mary's better, I'll be leaving. Leaving? Why? Aaron, this is half your place. We'll work it out. [MOANING] She's burning up with fever. You think I should try to get Doc Haymes? [MOANS] I'll go. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm going. No, I will. It's my wife and my baby. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yes. [MUSIC PLAYING] Just hurry. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hold on. Hold on. [BREATHES HEAVILY] [MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] [DOOR SLAMS] [GASPING] [MOANS] [BABY CRYING] [MOANING] [BABY CRYING] [MOANS] [BABY CRYING] The ways of the Lord-- we have not the knowledge of his infinite wisdom. And it is not our place to question why certain things happen. We must have faith in him from whom all good things come. And so, into the hands of our Lord Jesus Christ, and into his most bountiful mercy, we commend the soul of our brother, Jonathan Mead Gray, to life everlasting. Amen. MAN: Amen. ALL: Amen. WOMAN: Amen. A lot of me goes with you, Jonathan. [GASPS] All I can think of is how much he must have loved us to go out in that storm. Mary. [WHISPERS] You know, you're welcome to come back and live with us any time. I know. I'm just going to stay home. I, for one, don't know if I exactly approve of the two of them living together alone under the same roof. Why don't you mind your own business, Flora Hawkins? He wasn't very good with words. It was hard for him to say what he felt. I didn't know. Did you? He always kept that picture of me with him. He had it with him when they found him. [SIGHS] [BABY CRYING] [GRAPHOPHONE PLAYING] Aaron, please turn it off. Jonathan's gone, Mary. How can you manage the farm all alone? You're going to be all by yourself, you and Sarah. Doesn't that scare you? One word, Mary, girl, and I won't go. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BABY WHIMPERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [BABY CRYING] [DOOR CLICKS] [DOOR BANGS] [MUSIC PLAYING] It's called varsity drag. So that's what they're teaching you at the university this year, Sarah. Oh, Mother. Isn't this swell, Mrs. Grey? Swell. Well, John, I guess it's time to meet the family you're marrying into. My father-- he died in a snowstorm bringing the doctor to save our lives. And this-- this is my Uncle Aaron. Oh, he looks swell. He was a handsome rascal, wasn't he, Mama? This was always my favorite picture of you, Mother. JOHN: It's beautiful. MARY GRAY: That was a pretty dress, wasn't it? I know it's none of my business, Mrs. Gray. But you never remarried? I had a farm to run. SARAH GRAY: And me to raise. Quite a handful. Well, that's all the family there is. Is your uncle Aaron still alive? Oh, yeah. He lives in Kansas City-- still a bachelor, they say. SARAH GRAY: [LAUGHS] Thanks again, Mrs. Gray. Why don't you call me Mary? Thank you, Mary. Is there any reason, when John and I are in Kansas City, that we shouldn't look him up? No reason in the world. Sarah, we better get moving if we're going to make it to that dance on time. Well, I'll see you at Thanksgiving, Mother. Oh, and when we see Uncle Aaron, is there any message you want me to give him from you? Give him my love. JOHN: Bye!
