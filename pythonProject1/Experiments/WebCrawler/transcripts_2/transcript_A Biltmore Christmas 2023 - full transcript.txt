William West's His Merry Wife! Claude Lancaster as James, a lovelorn man in need of a little Christmas magic. Ava Hayward as Rebecca, the woman he loves. And introducing Jack Huston as Charlie, a guardian angel tasked with reuniting the two. An angel? Well, that depends on you, my friend. I am here to help. Now, tell me. What's this about a girl? [chuckles] We were meant to be married. I fouled it up. I'd need a miracle to make things right again. Well, lucky for you, it's Christmas time, and there's a miracle around every corner, pal. [chuckles] Now where is this girl? There she is. [light music] Rebecca. Say, what kind of game are you playing? You've helped lost souls before, Charlie. And you know good and well why this time is different. She's my wife. Maybe in another life. But tonight, she's your assignment. [scoffs] A picture for the ages. Our gift to you, our merry viewer. [bright music] Ms. Hardgrove? Mr. Balaban see you now. [phone rings in background] [chuckles] You've changed the ending. Charlie is supposed to pass up on his wings and help James get the girl. But instead, you have him, what, watch Rebecca as she drives out through the tall iron gates and into an uncertain future? Yes. It's real life. No, no, no, no, no, no. Leave real life for reality TV shows. This is a Christmas movie. Yes, it is, but I think we have a chance right now to bring His Merry Wife! into the 21st century and give audiences something modern and something real. Lucy, the title has an exclamation point. Would you like a peppermint? No, thank you. You know, every other studio passed on His Merry Wife! But my grandfather, Harold Balaban, saw the potential, knew that it had all the makings for a classic. Right, and I love a classic. I'm all for honoring the original version. Good. It's just that we are living in a different time period now, and I think this generation would want its own voice. My grandfather actually took me with him to Biltmore when he decided to visit the set. I had to be, I don't know, all of about seven at the time. I'll tell you, there's something really special about that place. So maybe what you need is to see it for yourself. Let's send you down to Asheville. Oh. OK. Good. You're going tomorrow. Oh, well, Christmas is in a few days. So... That's even better. You get to see the place all lit up. OK. Mr. Balaban... No. Michael, please. Michael. Michael. I'm just... I'm really not sure how to write something I don't believe. [chuckles] Lucy, I like you, and I think you have a lot of promise. But I also need a writer who's on the same page. OK? Now, Sandy will get you all the notes, take care of your travel plans. You just go to Biltmore, have a good time. Thanks. Good. Oh, and, Lucy, Lucy. Yes. I want a happy ending. OK? [light playful music] [gentle music] I wish it were different. For a moment, you made me so very happy. What are you doing, James? Go after her. Wouldn't change a thing, Charlie. She's in love with a memory. I never stood a chance. Thank you for all of your help. Help? Is that what you gave him? I'm so sorry. I was selfish. Just give me another chance to try to fix it. I'm afraid there's no time for second chances now. You know the rules, Charlie. Christmas is almost over. I don't care. If you leave, you can forget about those wings. (BOTH) I never did like to fly. What, I'm invested. The guy spends the whole movie trying to break those two up and then suddenly has a change of heart in the last 10 minutes. Yeah, it's romantic. It's convenient. Oh. You used to love this movie when we were little. You could practically recite it from memory. It's sappy. He loves her, and he knows it will make her happy. And we know that when push comes to shove, people will always choose their own happiness. OK, well, that is just the cynical, tortured writer side of you. Some people really do get a happily ever after. So what are you going to do about your script? I don't know, man. My career's been on life support for the last three years. I don't know that an opportunity like this is going to come around again. I think I just have to figure it out. Do you think you're going to be back by New Year's? There's just somebody I want you to meet. No, Becca. He's perfect for you. You say that every time. Because it's true almost every time. And you never, ever give these guys a chance. Jack Huston could walked through this door, and you would find something wrong with him. [laughs] That's not true. Come on, you just have to put yourself out there. I'm just going to spare myself the heartache. Hey, you deserve a really great guy who will sweep you off your feet. I like my feet right where they are. Plus, I have someone else's happiness to worry about. [sighs] [light music] We're going to miss you this year, and, you know, Dad promised that he would go caroling. Oh, yay. I need a video of that. OK. And please try to get some Christmas spirit before you're visited by three pushy ghosts. Pff, never. [laughs] OK, Merry Christmas. I miss you. Call me when you're back. OK. OK. [kisses] [gentle music] [sighs] Bah, humbug. [bright music] [chatter] Ms. Hardgrove? Hi. Welcome to the inn of the Biltmore Estate. Lucy. Oh, Winston. We're so happy to have you here. If you walk this way, I'll show you to your room. OK. You know, William West visited Biltmore when he was writing the original His Merry Wife! Hopefully we can be a similar inspiration to you. Here you go, your room, 359. Thank you so much. After you've had a chance to settle in, I'd love if you could join me for the evening tour of Biltmore House. Oh, thank you. I think I'm probably just going to sleep off some jet lag. I think it'll be worth your time. It starts in an hour. [soft, light music] [crickets chirping] Christmas at Biltmore is a tradition that goes all the way back to 1895. And we go to great lengths to try to recreate that same magic every year. Our guests tell us that they sometimes feel as if they've been transported to another time. Next up is the billiards room. Come this way. [light music] I can tell by the expressions on your face that some of you recognize this room. What holiday classic was shot at Biltmore? His Merry Wife! You are correct. Right this way. Principal photography began December of 1947 right here at Biltmore. And many pieces from our collection were incorporated into the film. This banquet table you may remember from the famous dinner party scene. [shutter clicks] No flash photography, please. [light music] Right this way. Here, we have the gown worn by Ava Hayward in the film's emotional conclusion. You know, Hayward wasn't the studio's first choice to play Rebecca. In fact, at this point in time, she was sort of considered box office poison. However, writer-director Williams West cast her, it revived her career, and she went on to win two Academy Awards. And here we have Mr. Claude Lancaster, Hollywood's Mr. Nice Guy. He brought the star power to this project. People say that he was just as nice in person. Jack Huston was a relative newcomer with just a couple of credits to his name. Funny story... he took a bit part in a musical called Meet Me in Poughkeepsie so he could get on to the lot and meet the studio head, Harold Balaban, who he convinced to get an audition for... His Merry Wife! His Merry Wife! Sadly, Jack passed away and wasn't able to enjoy the tremendous success of the film. He died the following Christmas. Anyway, thank you very much for coming. Enjoy the conservatory. [soft music, chatter] Lucy. If you have time, there is one more room I'd like you to see. Oh. Sure. [slinking music] Hey, Lester. Excuse me. Thank you. This is... [gasps] our grand library. It looks exactly the same. I know. You keep the prop on display all year round? Actually, the hourglass is not a prop. It comes from Biltmore's private collection. Oh. William West was so taken with it that he wrote it into the script. Hmm. It's cracked. So that happened during filming. Luckily, they were able to repair it. All it's got is that little infringement now. It's usually in a safe vault, but I had it brought out especially for you. I thought you might like to see it in person before it leaves. Leaves? It's being loaned to the Smithsonian as part of their Golden Age of Hollywood exhibition. [phone vibrates] Oh, that's exciting. Speaking of Hollywood, it's the studio. I'll give you a minute. Pardon me. Thank you. Hello, Mr. Balaban. Lucy. How are those rewrites coming? Great. I'm happy to hear it because we were hoping to see those new pages by the first. The first of? January. [tense music] [clatter] Lucy? Hello? Uh. Lucy. Yes. I'm still here. We've been shuffling the release schedule, and we're eyeing an earlier date. Now, I know that's a fast turnaround, but I have faith in you. Thank you, Mr. Balaban. I will do my best to get you what you need. It is a very short time frame. But I will get it to you. Mr. Balaban? Hello? [sighs] [FOREBODING MUSIC, SAND TRICKLING] Oh. [chatter] Sorry. [groans] [slinking music] Excuse me, do I can get some service around here? Well, Crafty's in front of the building. They serve a mean cup of coffee. [laughs] Funny guy. What is going on? Why is everybody in costume? [laughs] You're a funny girl. We're making a major motion picture... His Merry Wife! What is that? You look just like him. Who? Jack Huston. Well, I hope so. I am him. Who are you supposed to be in that getup? Mr. Huston. Yeah? They need you on set. What scene are we filming? 22. Well, hold on. Give me a sec, Gus. I'm talking to... myself. [chuckles] Let's go make a movie. [tense music] [heavy breathing] [sighs] OK, Lucille Hardgrove, this is not what it looks like. There's a perfectly rational explanation for everything looking like the 1940s. What is happening? You're jet lagged. You're daydreaming. Take a deep breath. Here we go. 3, 2, 1. [gasps, laughs] Lucy. Ms. Hardgrove? Did you see it? Are they still there? [dramatic music] What? Sorry. Where are the lights and the people in costume? I'm not sure what you mean. Are you all right? [light festive music] Hi, Mr. Balaban. It's Lucy. I'm really sorry. Our call dropped. I'm not really sure what happened. Anyway, give me a buzz back when you get a chance. Thank you. Oh, I wish I had known people were going to dress up. I would have brought my fascinator. It's just like the one Eva Hayward wears. What do you mean dress up, like historical reenactments or like cosplay characters from the film? Yeah, so you can take pictures with all the decorations. It's in the brochure. It's in the brochure. Uh-huh. I'm Margaret. I'm Lucy. Well, Lucy, we better double time it if we're going to get there before it starts. It what? The tree lighting. Oh. Come on. [festive violin music] So are you here with family? No, I'm a... I'm a writer. I'm here on work. Oh, what do you write? Movies. How glamorous. Yeah, it's fun. Have you ever met Sandra Bullock. Sadly, no. Oh, well, that's too bad because I read somewhere that she is very nice. Hey, you should write a movie for her. [gasps] [clapping] This trip was my Christmas gift to myself. [laughs] I wanted to visit for as long as I can remember. Because of His Merry Wife! How'd you know? You seem like a fan. [laughs] Yeah. My mother and I used to watch it every year at Christmas. It was our little tradition. She would make a big bowl of popcorn, and then we'd break out the box of Kleenex. It's my absolute favorite movie. Being here, it's a little like I'm in it. Like, oh, look, right over there is where Rebecca first meets James's disapproving parents. Oh, and that is where Charlie sees Rebecca for the first time and realizes his last assignment to get his wings is the woman he loves. Oh, and when he races through the Italian garden to stop her from leaving. I mean, they just don't make men like that anymore. There are so many locations I want to get photos of. I mean, this was a major motion picture. [light shimmering music] I'll be right back. OK. [slinking music, chatter] [dramatic orchestral music] [exhales] [gentle string music] [slinking music] [sand trickling] [dramatic music] [sand trickling] [dramatic music] [laughs] [chatter] Oh, this cannot... this cannot be happening. Hey, you're not supposed to be back here. Oh. This is a closed set. Mr. West's orders. Mr. West? We're going to need for you to come with me. There you are. You're late. The boys from central casting told me you'd be here an hour ago. Sandra, right? Candy cane girl? Yes. We got to get you to wardrobe. Follow me. Here's a piece of advice for me to you. Time is money in this business. And if you're not 5 minutes early, you're 10 minutes late. What on earth are you wearing? [sighs] Looks like they flubbed your measurements at the agency. Nothing we can do now. [soft tense music] All right, OK. This is all going to be over, just like it was last time. 1, 2, 3. [door opens] You were due on set 15 minutes ago. [sighs] Put this on, and get to set. [tense music] All right, it's the night of the big Christmas to do. You've just told your folks that you plan to wed, and they threaten to cut you out of the will. But you love her. But you need his help. Now, remember, nobody can see you except for the big lug here. Yes, sir. Ready for rehearsal? I think we got it. Let's go again. Places, everyone, places. Speed. Music. [light music] Action. Don't look now, but I think we have an audience. [scoffs] [sighs] Will your parents ever approve of me? Oh, hush now. They'll come around, kid. And if they don't? Tell her that you'll whisk her away. I'll whisk you far away from me. Whisk? And I'll tell her that you'll buy her a house. Buy us a house of our own. A house? Tell her that you'll fill it with roses. And fill it with roses. Roses? One for every day since you walked into my life. Oh, that's a nice touch, kid. Well, that'd be grand if I weren't allergic to them. Mmm. Sorry about that, old sport. I thought that was right on the money. And cut. Oh, stop stepping on my line, sweetheart. My apologies. Next time, I'll aim for your feet. [groans] Hmm. [playful music] Thank you, Peggy. Hi, there. Hi. I'm Jack Huston. You got a name? Oh, Sandra. Sandra. Sandra? Bullock. Well, Ms. Bullock, it's nice to meet you, again. Yeah. Now, look at this. It's been 10 seconds, and you haven't bolted for the door. So I'd say we're already off to a better start. Oh, I've been here too long. Do you have somewhere that you need to be? You could say that. Well, I did say that. Did you see where that security guard went? Yeah, he went that way. Great. Oh. Hey, hold this for me, Gus. [slinking music] [tense music] Ms. Bullock, what was with the disappearing act earlier? Don't they need you for the next scene? Nah. They're filming the final scene of the movie. Well, last time I checked, you were in that. [laughs] That's news to me. What do you mean? Whoa, watch your head. What do you mean? No, Charlie gives up a chance at his wings, he chases Rebecca out into the garden, they share a final goodbye, and she reunites with James. That's the end of the movie. No, that's not the script that I read. It's not? No. But what made you say that? Because I've been thinking of something along those lines, and nobody will go for it. I am Sandra. [tense music] I'm starting to think it's me. [light upbeat music] She said she was an actress. Well, where did she go? [tense music] [gasps] You... how... where did you come from? I can explain. No, I can't. You weren't there. And then you were there. What are you wearing? [stammers] Why are you here? Well, you were so upset. I was worried. You said you'd be right back, and you were gone almost an hour. An hour. An hour! OK. Hey, is that the one from the movie? Yeah, don't touch it. Why not? Ladies, I'm sorry, we're about to close up for the night. Oh. Sorry. I just was here to take photos of the hourglass for my research. And I'm sure we'll be able to accommodate you during the appropriate hours. Sure, sure. Yeah. Sorry. By the way, I love this costume. Oh. Straight out of the movie. [laughs] Yeah. It's funny. Hey, you've been running the His Merry Wife! tour for quite some time, right? I have. So you must know a bit about the obscure trivia surrounding the production. Yes. Are you thinking of something specific? Have you heard anything about an alternate ending? There were rumors. Nothing substantiated. What kind of rumors? Well, that it was more somber, something bittersweet. What happened to that? Why did William West change it? Did the studio step in? No one knows. I don't think we'll ever know. Everyone involved with that production has passed on. I think that ending is lost to history. [soft music] [sobbing] Please. Rebecca, it's all my fault. You have to stop. Charlie. How? You can see me? Just for now, Charlie. [soft music] Well, then we don't have much time. And I want you to know that I love you, and I have always loved you. And I don't want to be the thing that's holding you back. The greatest gift that you can give me is to live your life and find a little happiness. Now, he's a little stiff. But you could do worse. Merry Christmas, Charlie. Merry Christmas. [light music] [inquisitive music] Lucy, I hope you can join us tonight for the gift-giving event. It's been a tradition here since 1895. Did you know on the first Christmas Biltmore opened its doors, it was to the employees' families in the spirit of generosity, gratitude? And there was a handpicked gift under the tree for each child and staff member. That's a lovely tradition. Yes, it is. Did you also know that the hourglass was gifted to the Biltmore collection that very same Christmas? Yes. Speaking of that hourglass, you mentioned that you had other props and costumes from the movie in storage. There's not enough room to put them all out. Right. Could I possibly take a look at some of those? I'm not sure it's worth your while. It's mostly extras' costumes, and they've been in mothballs for years. Please. Sure. Come on. OK. [slinking music] [light string music] [playful music] OK. Ah. I'll pay you back. Scout's honor. You know, I knew that outfit you were wearing last night looked familiar. And then I remembered where I saw it. It was on the tour. But here's the funny part. It was still there this morning on display. You appeared out of thin air wearing clothes from another time. There can only be one explanation. [tense music] You're a ghost. I'm not a ghost. And you're trapped here at Christmas with unfinished business. I'm literally holding something in my hand. I can help. If you need to get a grave message to a loved one or right some wrong... I went back in time to 1947. What? They were filming His Merry Wife! here, and then the costumer thought that I was the actress playing the candy cane girl, so they put me in that outfit. But then I came back. And it was really weird. Oh. I know. I know. Hold on. Here. You all right? How long were you there? The first time, I think I... The first time? You went back more than once? Yes. Well, I had to make sure I wasn't crazy. [laughs] Still haven't arrived at an answer, honestly. Is that why you're looking through the old wardrobes? Are you planning to go back? Yeah, I got something I got to do. This is unbelievable, right? How did this even happen? The hourglass was sitting there, I turned it over, and it brought me here. I mean there but here. Before I knew it, I was just standing there talking to Jack Huston. [gasps] Is he just as charming in real life? [laughs] He's kind of pushy, actually. Oh. Oh. Oh, I understand. You're going back for him. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh, that is just about the most romantic thing I have ever heard. No, I promise I'm not going back for anyone. So if you're not going back for Jack Huston, then what are you going back for? [soft music] I can't believe you didn't tell me you were writing the remake of His Merry Wife! Who's going to play Charlie? Oh, you should ask that Ryan Reynolds. I mean, he would be perfect. He's got just the right amount of charisma. What, what does any of this have to do with you going back in time? Well, I have to find out what was in that original ending and why they changed it. ["HARK! [THE HERALD ANGELS SING" PLAYING] ♪ (SINGING) Hark, the ♪ ♪ Herald angels sing, ♪ ♪ glory to the newborn king. ♪ ♪ Peace on Earth, and mercy mild, ♪ ♪ God and sinners reconciled. ♪ ♪ Joyful all ye nations rise. ♪ ♪ Join the triumph of the skies. ♪ ♪ Hark, the herald angels sing, ♪ ♪ glory to the newborn king. ♪ You look great. What are you doing here? I'm your backup. My backup? Well, I just thought that in case something goes wrong on this end, you might need somebody. Oh, no, that's OK. It's your Christmas vacation. You should go enjoy it. Are you kidding? This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me. OK. So how's this work? So when I turned the hourglass the first time, there were only a few minutes of sand left, which is why I think my first trip was so short. But the second time, I got the full hour. So you'll only be gone an hour. Barring any unforeseen circumstances. Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean, what if you change something in the past? Won't that affect the future? It's going to be fine. What if somebody suspects you? Well, I've seen His Girl Friday like a dozen times. I think if I just throw in a buster here and a fella there, I'll blend right in. OK. OK. Lucy? Good luck. And say hey to Jack for me. [soft foreboding music] [sand trickling] [soft shimmering music] [bright festive music] [excited screaming] Not today, ladies. Not today. Not before coffee. Well, hiya, girls. I'll sign it for if you want. I'm in the picture, too. The name is Jack Huston. Here. There you are. Ah. Mr. West, got an idea for you, sir. And then get this, he gives up his wings because he loves her. What do you think? I think he should stick to saying the lines and not writing them. [chuckles humorlessly] But you'll consider it? [whistling] [light music] [soft downbeat music] Ms Bullock? Ms. Bullock. Oh. Now, you listen here. You can't just march up on a dame and give her the what for, buster. Hey. Excuse me. Let go of me. I am not a piece of luggage. No, you're absolutely right. Luggage comes with a tag. It lets you know where it came from. Who are you? Where are you from? We called central casting, and no one knows who you are. Are you even Sandra Bullock? I'm Lucy Hardgrove. And you may not believe this, but I'm from the studio. Studio? You don't say. Yes. Well, Mr. Balaban, he heard about all the discord on set. He sent me to keep an eye on things. Really? Yes. He's a very busy man. Prove it. Oh, you took a bit part in Meet Me in Poughkeepsie so that you could audition for this part and get on the lot. [laughs] Do you know I camped in front of that parking spot for three days? How did you know that? Well, I told you, Mr. Balaban sent me. All right, well, obviously, this is a misunderstanding. I apologize, Ms. Hardgrove, and I hope there are no hard feelings. [chuckles] [chuckles] Of course not. [soft playful music] [soft foreboding music] [light music] He really doesn't give up his wings. Ms. Hardgrove. [laughs] I just want to introduce myself. Claude Lancaster. I know. I'm such a fan. I just loved you in Mr. Grayson Takes a Vacation. Oh, well, I have to say, I've heard nothing but wonderful things about you. From whom? Well, Harold Balaban. I'm so pleased that he's responded to my concerns. There's still time to replace her. Replace her? Yes, it pains me to even suggest it, but Hayward's last three films were flops. She'll sink us. But don't you worry your pretty little head. I have got some ideas for who we might get. [laughs humorlessly] Took the liberty of jotting the names down. And Mr. Balaban is on board with this? I thought that's why you were here. Just testing you. [chuckling] [soft, light music] Ava. You don't think they would shut us down, do you? There'd be no reason. Besides the fact that we're behind schedule and over budget? [chuckles softly] Yeah, besides that. Then no. None at all. [dramatic music] [tense string music] Shoot. Hiya. There you are. [glass shatters] Oh. No. No, no, no, no. [gasps] It's OK. I'll take the blame. I'll say it's my fault. It's OK. Get this cleaned up. [heavy music] [foreboding music] What in the world? Ah. [vibrates lips] Ma. [clears throat] Buzz off, McGee. I know what you're doing. Reading the funny pages? You've been sending word to Mr. Balaban that there's trouble on set, trying to muscle me out. Well, that's a one-way ticket to the naughty list. Paranoia is an ugly look on you, Ava. Yeah? Well, that suit's not exactly doing you any favors. That's some crack. Yeah, but can you fix it? Not sure. I need that hourglass. For the movie... picture. I'll do what I can. I can't make any promises. There she is. Well, that was some spill you took. Give her some space. I hope somebody got the license plate of that bus. She's concussed. I'm fine. Thanks. Lucy, what year is it? 1947. Ah. And who's the president? Oh. Mm, yeah, we should get her to a doctor. No, no, I know this. Truman? That a girl. Oh, where did he go? Who? Oh, the man with the hourglass. Gus? Where did he go? I think he went that way. Who's your friend, and what's her hurry? Well, it's Balaban's girl. Just flew in from LA. Strange duck. Yes, she is. [light string music] An angel? Well, now that depends on you, my friend. I am here to help. Now, what's this about a girl? We were meant to be married. I fouled it up. I'd need a miracle to make things right again. Well, lucky for you, it's Christmas time, and there's a miracle around every corner, pal. [chuckles] Now where is this girl? There she is. Rebecca. And cut. We good? It's North Carolina, not the North Pole. Gus? Yeah. He left. He left? Is he coming back today? No. Said he needed to take the hourglass off site after you cracked that thing like an egg. [sighs] OK. When is the call time tomorrow? It's Christmas Eve. We're off. But he should be back for the party tomorrow night. Ava, how do I look? Up to something. Oh, no, no, no. She's a stranger in a brand new place. I just thought she might enjoy some company for supper. That's all. So you can sweet talk her into a three-picture deal over martinis? [laughs] I'm a gentleman, Ava. I'm going to wait for dessert. Stop it Jack. Is this seat taken? I'm expecting someone. Ah. [sighs] What looks good? Ha, figgy pudding. Have you ever had figgy pudding? Once when I was a kid. What's in it, I wonder? Figs. Say, you don't suppose that's where they got the name, do you? Would you care to join me? Well, if you insist. Now, you sure he won't mind? Who? The gentleman that you're waiting for. I'm not waiting for anyone. Gee, you don't say. Now, I hope that Mr. Balaban knows just how grateful I am to be in this picture. And I want to assure him... thank you. And I want to assure him that a bet on Jack Huston is a surefire winner. And you'd like me to put in a good word for you. No, I mean, only if you really mean it. I don't think that I need to. I think your work really speaks for itself. I mean, a soda is a nickel here. It's not where you're from? No. And where is that exactly? Santa Monica. Oh, Santa Monica. By way of Ohio. Oh. That must be tough being this far away from home at Christmas time. Yeah, it's definitely not what I expected. And what would you be doing if you weren't here? My sister and I go caroling every Christmas. It's kind of a tradition. We hit every house in the neighborhood until our voices are hoarse. Then we drink hot chocolate. Now that is something that I can help with. You know a good hot chocolate joint around here? I know a great hot chocolate joint. All right. I'm not hungry, anyway. Let's go. [light festive music] Well, what about you? Any Christmas traditions? Well, we didn't have a lot when I was growing up. But my father, who worked at a factory, made sure that he'd always saved enough money to take my mother and I to a nickelodeon on Christmas Day every year. And my mother would always insist that I choose the picture, and I always chose a comedy because they were her favorite. And I would sit in that dark theater, light dancing in her eyes, watching her laugh. And that was the best Christmas gift. Is that why you wanted to become an actor? It sure is, yeah. I started out as a stunt man. I had a job on a cowboy picture called Wagons West. And the actor got bucked off the pony, and I fit the chaps. I got a promotion. I got two lines, which I still remember. "He ain't lying, sheriff. The horse belongs to Billy the Kid." [laughs] That was you? So you've seen it? Yes, I've seen it. I watch a ton of Turner Classic Movies and the Criterion Collection and... You lost me, bright eyes. I'll need a map to find my way back. That's always been my dream, to be up on that silver screen, to see my name in lights. Mm. Yeah, really make your mark in the world. Yeah. So I hope your boss can find it in his heart to keep this movie up and running. I've got a very good feeling about this little picture. I think it's going to be the one. Mm. Now, who are you really? What do you mean? Well, nobody hoofs it all the way from Ohio to Hollywood to sit behind a desk. No, no, let me guess. You're not an actress. [laughs] No. Singer? Ah. You're a writer. How did you know that? Yeah, lucky guess. How did you know that? It's lucky guess, Lucy. Now tell me your story. Uh. Well, I'm not sure there's too much I can say about myself. Well, hold on now, that's not fair. I just told you my sad story. You got to tell me something. Start at the beginning. What's your favorite color? Green. Green. What's your favorite number? 17 and 1/2. What's your picture? Wagons West. [laughs] [gentle music] We had a poinsettia on our table every Christmas. My mother was a seamstress for the mayor's wife, and she would gift us one every season because she said it wasn't really Christmas until you had your "poin-settia." Are you still close with your folks? No. I've been an orphan for a long time. They both passed. Sorry. My mother actually left when I was little. So it's just been my dad and my sister and me. I'm so sorry. Oh, it's OK. Thank you. But I learned a valuable lesson. If you put your faith in people, eventually they're going to break your heart. So you have to protect yourself. You know? I've been giving a lot of thought to your idea about Charlie giving up his wings for love. And I think that he would. Would you? What? Would you really give up what you wanted more than anything else in the world for someone else's happiness? I don't know. But I hope that one day, I love someone enough to find out. [gentle music] Detective pictures. What? What you write, you write detective pictures like Dorothy Parker. [laughs] What makes you say that? Well, I mean, you don't strike me as the sword and sandals type, and you're a little down on romance. I am... what... I am not down on romance. I just want to write something that's real and meaningful. Mm. Can't get any more meaningful than two lonely hearts finding a little slice of happiness in this crazy world. Give a little hope to us poor saps. As my friend Jimmy likes to say, "The best movies, they inspire us. They show us what we could be, appeal to our better angels." [laughs] That's very good. Thank you. Yes. I don't write detective pictures. Oh, oof. Usually, I am very good at this. Hold on. Let me see. [whistles] You're an early riser. Night owl. Mmm. Ah. You prefer dogs to cats Meow, meow. You like your coffee with cream and sugar. Black. Mmm. You arrived at parties late and you leave early. Now that I do. Me too. See? Give me your hand. Oh, gosh. I forgot. OK. High five. It's like good job. Come on, try. High five. Yeah, it's something we do where I'm from. Santa Monica. By way of Ohio. Huh. [gentle music] [inquisitive music] Oh, Ms. Majors. Yes? Have you seen this Hardgrove? What? No. Why? Well, she mentioned she wanted to take some additional reference photos of the hourglass. I thought I'd give her a chance before it's gone. Gone? Where? It's going to be picked up by the Smithsonian curator right after the holiday party. Tomorrow night? Yeah. So if you see her, you'll tell her? Well, thank you for the hot chocolate and the company. See? I'm not half bad if you don't race off mid conversation. Well, good night. Well, no, I'm going to walk you to your room. Oh, oh. No, that won't be necessary. I insist. [soft, light music] Uh. Oh, well, this is... this is me. Huh. Are you sure? Sure. And you're sure you're sure? I'm sure I'm sure. That's funny because 359, that's mine. Oh, three. Oh, does that say three? Um, I'm one floor up. So I guess I'm walking you to your door. [laughs] You're a little screwy, aren't you? Honey, you have no idea. Good night, Lucy. Good night. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Yes. I think Judy Garland is stuck in your elevator. I can hear her shrieking. In E flat. [soft slinking music] [whistles softly] [gentle music] [chatter] I hear your Balaban's girl. [laughs softly] You're not really thinking of recasting Rebecca, are you? Where did you get that idea? Lancaster. Rewrites? Well, a film is ever evolving. It's a good ending. I'm sorry they're making you change it. No one's asked me to change it. They didn't? Not unless you're the messenger. No, I like it. Huh. I will admit Harold had his reservations, but it's the only ending I could see. Yes, it's honest. I mean, life rarely gives us happy endings. That's true. [christmas music] My dad always says Christmas is good for two things, and one of them is reconnecting with people we love. What's the other? [laughs] Eggnog. [chuckles] You heard her. Two, please. [laughs] Thanks. Hey, cheers. We were together for 15 years. Mmm. Every Christmas, I'd always ask for the same thing... a new tie. [laughs] She always insisted on tying it for me to make sure it was straight. It's the only time I ever let her fuss over me. And then one day, she told me that she was tired of sharing me with my job. I can't blame her. It's a lonely life. Have you thought about telling her that you miss her? Great gal like that doesn't wait around for an old fool like me to come to his senses. Thanks, but I would rather spare myself the heartache. It doesn't seem like you've been spared much at all. [gentle piano music] [chatter] [light music] What are you going to do for Christmas, Lucy? I know, let's time travel back to 1947 and get stuck there. [sighs] Why couldn't the hourglass be a DeLorean? [upbeat piano music] Hi. Don't stop on my account. I was enjoying the show. Actually, you're in time for the duet. Oh. Oh, brother. I mean, you said for yourself, you go caroling every Christmas Eve, right? That's true. Well, you know "Jingle Bells"? Do I know "Jingle Bells"? Say, do I know "Jingle "Bells"? [laughs] ["jingle bells" playing] Oh, excuse me. ♪ (SINGING) Dashing ♪ ♪ through the snow... ♪ Oh. ♪ (SINGING)... on a one ♪ ♪ horse open sleigh. ♪ ♪ O'er the fields we go, ♪ ♪ laughing all the way. ♪ ♪ (SINGING) Bells on bobtail ring. ♪ There it is. ♪ (SINGING) Making spirits bright. ♪ Nice. ♪ (SINGING) What fun it ♪ ♪ is to laugh and sing ♪ ♪ a sleighing song tonight. ♪ ♪ (BOTH SINGING) Oh, jingle ♪ ♪ bells, jingle bells, ♪ ♪ jingle all the way. ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ ♪ in a one horse open sleigh. ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells. ♪ ♪ (SINGING) Jingle all the way. ♪ ♪ Beautiful. ♪ ♪ (BOTH SINGING) Oh, what fun ♪ ♪ it is to ride in a one horse ♪ ♪ open sleigh. ♪ [laughs] There we go. That's... They never should have cut you for Meet Me in Poughkeepsie. Better save the encore. You hear the news? What news? Hayward's out. She's fired? She quit. [dramatic music] What do you mean she's gone? Peggy said that she grabbed all of her stuff and took off. Had the sound guys toting her luggage. Maybe it's time to replace her. No. You can't. What about everything you shot already? [sighs] We'll cut our losses. There's nothing we can do. The studio will jump at the chance to cast a bigger name. It was the fight of my life to get them to agree to Ava in the first place. Just give me today. I'll find her. Please, it's Christmas Eve. One day. Hey, wait, where are you going? Hold on. Lucy, what are you going to do? I'm going to go search every hotel, airport, and bus station until I find her. She can't have gotten far. Why are you sticking your neck out? You heard what West said. Your boss never wanted her. He'll probably be over the moon. Any meddling behind his back is going to land you in hot water. [laughs] Now, I like Ava. But you don't owe her anything. Yes, I do. This whole thing happened because I came in. I'm going to make it right now. Is there a phone around here? Lucy, you may be OK with crossing Mr. Balaban, but I got a three-picture deal on the line. I understand. I do, actually. I think there's a phone at the inn. [soft music] [light festive music] [horn honks] Hop in, kid. I got a tip from the parking attendant. I heard that she was headed for the train station. Come on. [upbeat jazzy music] Sorry. Excuse me. What time is it? Oh, it's going to be a miracle if we find her. Well, lucky for you, it's Christmas time, and there's a miracle around every corner. That's a line from the movie. It's a good line. Ah, see? There she is. [clears throat] Ava. Save your breath, Huston. I've made up my mind. Come on. Come back to set. We need you. You and I both know I wasn't the studio's choice, first, second, or third. Mr. Balaban's had my replacement lined up for weeks, with the enthusiastic endorsement of Mr. Claude Lancaster no doubt. Who cares what they think? You were born to play this role. She's right. Worst thing you can do in this business is overstay your welcome. The audience gave up on me a long time ago. Maybe it's time I took the hint. What are you going to do? I haven't decided yet. Maybe I'll buy a farm with some chickens and an old goat. A goat? Yes, get a slice of that simple life. Listen. I know things seem bad right now. But you are destined for great things, and it all starts with this part. Your friend talks like a fortune cookie. I know, that's a part of her charm. Now arriving, 6:20 to New York. Well, I appreciate the pep talk, but that's my train. You can't go. Hey, you know what? Lucy, let her go. She can't hack it anyway. What? Have you heard back from Hepburn yet? Uh, well, actually, we're going to go with Veronica Lake. I think Claude's a big fan. Oh, I bet he is. Ah, Ava, I'm so sorry. This is business movie talk. It doesn't it concern you. Sayanora, arrivederci, all that. Send us a postcard when you get there. Mm. He says he's going to give her a [clears throat] top billing. Oh, is that so? And the bigger dressing room. You don't say. You know, Claude is a swell guy. Swell, my foot. Claude Lancaster wouldn't know good intentions if it knocked him upside the head. And if he thinks for one second he's going to replace me with one of those silly actresses from his Christmas list, well, he's got another thing coming. And for the record, I saw right through this little song and dance. But does that mean you're coming back with us anyway? I just remembered. I'm allergic to goats. Oh, boys? [laughs] Well, we just squeaked by. [laughs] Hey. [train blares] Thanks, fellas. [light jazzy music] Well, now you are an odd duck, but I think I got your number. Oh? You say that you're a solo act, but you seem to care an awful lot about the happiness of other people. Well, guess you've got me all figured out. Almost all figured out. There is one thing I'd like to know. What's that? Would you like to be my date to the Christmas party? Oh, brother. Is it too late to pick the chickens? (BOTH) Yes. [upbeat jazzy music] [chatter] You look beautiful. Thank you. Ava lent her dress. You're welcome. [light jazzy music] Thank you. You're welcome. Cheers. Now, the family started this tradition of handing out presents on Christmas Eve back in 1895. Can you believe that? It's been nearly 52 years. Is that... Mm-hmm, that's Bill's wife. [sighs] [light cheerful music] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you. You're welcome. Hi. Hi. Well, I see you managed to corral our wayward star. Yes, with a little help. I wanted to thank you. Oh. I took your advice and called my wife and apologized, told her I missed her. What did she say? She asked me what took me so long. [laughs] You know, I guess my happy ending was always there. I just needed to open my eyes and see it. And maybe these characters deserve a happy ending, too. He ain't lying, sheriff. The horse belongs to Billy the Kid. [imitates gunfire] Oh, you got me. Well, if I don't see you before tomorrow, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [soft, light music] [slow festive music] Oh. Hello. I know your secret. Oh? Mm, you talked Ava back into the picture. Yes, well, you have nothing to worry about. She's going to be great. Oh, we had a plan. You had a plan. There was no we. Ah, see, now that's where you're wrong, Ms. Hardgrove. May I cut in? No. Yes. Hi. Hi. I should have known that your dance card would have filled up the minute you stepped on the dance floor. This is where I admit I have two left feet. Ah, well, then just follow my lead. [soft music] You know, the thought has just occurred to me that it is Christmas Eve, and I didn't get you a Christmas gift. I don't need a gift. Yeah, but I want you to have one, and I think I know just the thing. [laughs] I can't take your watch. Yes, you can because I think that you use it more than I do. And next time you're running late, well, you can think of me. I will. Thank you. What are you doing New Year's Eve? If you don't have to get back to Los Angeles right away, there's a little shindig down in the village. Um. What? Too much too soon? I just... I feel like I have always meant to know you. And now that I've met you, I can't see a future without you in it. Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. What am I doing? This isn't real. None of this is real. Lucy. No. I'm so sorry. I wasn't expecting you. [somber music] Oh, Ms. Hardgrove, I've been looking for you. Oh. Is everything all right? Yes. Thank you. Well, we were able to fix the hourglass. What? The hourglass. I took care of it. Good as new Thank you. Where is it? It's in the prop master's truck, parked right out front. All right. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [gentle music] Here, sweetheart. Peppermint. Michael. Michael, I told you to stay where I could see you. Your grandfather will be back as soon as he's talked to Mr. West. Michael Balaban? [exhales] Well, that means your grandfather is... Harold. He just got in. Come along now. [dramatic music] Where's West? I'm not sure, sir. I think his wife just arrived. Do you know how much money I've sunk into this picture? Too much for him to take a second honeymoon. Absolutely. I just wanted to talk to you about Ms. Hardgrove. Who? Ms. Hardgrove? The studio liaison you sent. Son, if I sent someone in my place, why would I be standing here? But she's been on set for days. Probably works for one of those tabloids. You, come here. I want you to find this Hardgrove lady, now. [foreboding music] [light music] Oh, I just can't thank you enough for taking me through the house again. Twice. It's just so much to see. And we only have a few dozen more items to get to. We're going to have to get to that tomorrow because I have got... But I won't be here tomorrow. I'll get Paige. I'll get... [shouts] What happened? It's my trick knee. It always acts up in the cold. [groans] [groaning] [heavy music] Lucy. Can we talk? I have to go. Go where? Why? I can't explain it right now. Lucy. Jack, I'm not who you think I am. What does that mean? Who are you? There she is. Oh, no. [tense music] Ms. Majors, stop. Lucy. Why are you running? [tense music] What is going on? You can trust me. Talk to me. OK. I'm not from the studio. Where are you from? I'm from the future. Huh? What's the gag? I'm from 80 years in the future, Jack. I turned an hourglass, the one that I broke, and it brought me here, and now I'm stuck. You're serious. If they find me, they'll take me away, and I'll never be able to get home. [knocking] Let me in, Jack. Give me a key for this door. [knocking] I know it sounds crazy. I do. Let me in! [knocking] You got five seconds to open this door, Huston, or you could kiss your career goodbye. [tense music] I just need to get to the hourglass on the prop master's truck. [knocking] There's a back door, up those stairs. Go. I'll buy you some time. Thank you. Jack. [soft music] Go. Thank you. Thank you. Lucy. I'm glad that you came into my life, even if it was only for a little while. Oh, Jack, there's something you need to know about your life. On Christmas Eve 1948... [lock clicks] Where's the girl? Hiya, fellas. Where's the girl? Don't be smart with me, Huston. I saw her come in the room. Now where did she go? She went home, Balaban. Home. [tense music] Where do you think you're going? Oh, hi, I was looking for you. Save it. I know you're not from the studio. Fine, you got me. I'll see myself out. Ah, ah, ah. Not so fast. Mr. Balaban would like a word first. [grunts] She's a fraud! I'll take care of this one. [grunts] Thank you. [groans] And another thing. I'll be taking top billing and the bigger dressing room, buster. [tense music] But it's Christmas Eve. Can't it wait until tomorrow? I'm sorry. The curator's waiting. [tense music] Lucy! Wait. [soft music] [soft somber music] [sand trickling] Please, please, just one more day. There you are. Finally. Oh, thank goodness. Your friend was very determined that you have one last chance to see the hourglass before we took it away. Thank you. I'm all set. Where have you been? It's a long story. Well, did you find it, what you were looking for? [sighs] [tense music chord] [soft, gentle music] No. No. I tried to warn him. I guess some things are just always meant to be. They're showing His Merry Wife! in the theater soon. I could save you a seat. No, thank you. I think I'll just call it a night. [JAZZY MUSIC, PROJECTOR CLICKING] Don't look now, but I think we have an audience. Will your parents ever approve of me? [stifled giggle] Oh, hush now. They'll come around, kid. And if they don't? Tell her that you'll whisk her away. Oh. [gentle music, chatter] Hiya, kid. Well, I'm sure glad you're back. Couldn't let you hog all the spotlight. [laughs] Well, I guess you'll need this, the rewrites from West. Go on, read the last page. ♪ (SINGING) Have yourself ♪ ♪ a merry little... ♪ The old man had a change of heart.

Merry Christmas, Charlie. Merry Christmas. Cut. Nice work. It is a lovely scene, Lucy. I'm so glad you kept the happy ending. Me too. Oh. You nailed it. Great work, kid. There won't be a dry eye left in the house. Thank you. I can honestly say my time here was worth it. I can say it really was. Peppermint? I just had the strangest sense of deja vu. Smile! [laughs] That is so exciting. Would you excuse me for just a moment? See you at the wrap party. I want to talk next steps. I see big things in your future. Good. Hi. Oh. Give me one sec. What'd you think? This is going to be better than Check in to Christmas. Whoa. [gentle music] Fresh from its debut at the Smithsonian. Still got time to put it in your movie. Ha. We've replaced it with a different, less breakable prop. I just thought you might like to see it one last time before it goes back in the vault, considering your history. [soft music] Goodbye, Jack. [gentle music] How are you here? Well, you're a hard one to forget, Lucy Hardgrove. Now, I tried a thousand times to get that hourglass to bring me to you, and it never worked. And then I remembered something that you told me... December 24, 1948. I guess I just needed a little Christmas magic. The newspaper said that you died. It's a cover story that we planted just in case of an unexplained disappearance. Does that mean you... you stay? Well, that depends on you. You would really give up everything you've ever known for me. Why? Because I love you. [light music] [whistling] Huh. So this is the future, huh? Yeah. Stick with me, kid. I'll show you around. Well, I'm planning on it. Merry Christmas, Jack. Oh, merry Christmas, Lucy. [light cheerful music] [upbeat jazzy music] [audio logo]
