foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- What's...? I say, what's our status, boy? It's Cecil the Turtle. There wasn't enough room for "the Turtle"... ...so it just says Cecil, but I am a turtle. I don't care if you're the Loch Ness Monster. Wha...? You should care. Are they in position or not, son? Uh... Uh... Uh... Now they are. There she is. The elusive flora oculta. Blooms once every 200 years. And today's... I say, today's our lucky day. Commence Operation Flower Grab. Commence Operation Flower Grab. Operation Flower Grab. Who came up with that name? That was me. You're fired. Huh? Aw. - Oh. What happened? - I'll tell you what happened. Someone just got to the world's most powerful weapon before we did. I say someone just got to the world's most powerful weapon... Okay, we heard you the first time. Excuse me? Oh. Sorry. Didn't see you there. I was just taking my lunch break. Actually, that's not true. I was sleeping under the counter. That's only because my boss doesn't give me a sleep break, which I think is weird. - I'm sorry, did you need something? - I'd like to buy this perfume. Ew, really? You wanna buy this? Why? Is it bad? No, it's not bad. It's just... [SNIFFS] Well, it's fine. I mean, sure it's got some jasmine, a hint of vanilla, maybe a little sandalwood... ...but does this move you? - What do you mean? - A scent needs to transport you. It needs to caress you, evoke memories, make you feel like you're not alone. A scent should envelop you, take care of you, love you. Does this scent do that for you? I need to call my therapist. Come again. WOMAN: Oh! What on earth do you think you're doing? Your job is to sell perfume. Uh, this isn't perfume. Oh, here we go. It isn't. You don't think any perfume is good enough. - Mine will be. - Don't tell me you're clinging to the idea... ...you're gonna create the most beautiful fragrance... ...take it to Paris and sell it to the House of Moufette? That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Lola, the House of Moufette is the preeminent perfumery in the industry. They're not interested in a little shop girl who makes perfume in her bathtub. I make them in my sink, okay? The bathtub is where I keep my sweaters. I have a very teeny apartment. I keep my shoes in my stove. My freezer's full of sunglasses. I don't care. Just like the House of Moufette is never gonna care about your "perfume." It doesn't matter that Giovanni doesn't believe in me. All that matters is that I believe in me. Is that right? Or is it I believe in myself. Is it I believe in I-self? No, that's definitely wrong. I'm gonna stick with I believe in me. [SINGING] The world can be such a stinky place With the stench of humanity in your face I'm gonna clear the room Of gloom and doom When I create my own perfume I've got a smell in my mind And I'm gonna let it loose on the world I know that my fragrance Will make a real difference [MAN COUGHS] 'Cause a scent is worth a thousand words I'll break open a bunch of candy bars And harvest out the nougat Then I'll take the odor From a four leaf clover And mix them all into it Sandalwood sure smells good When you blend it with apple pie A hint of some geranium This toilette is eau so fine Like a butterfly, if butterflies smelled like Puppies and forgiveness and wishing wells I've got a smell in my mind And I'm gonna let it loose on the world I know that my fragrance Will make a real difference 'Cause a scent is worth a thousand words I've got an itch to find a witch And harness all of her powers We'll fly on her broom To the top of the moon Then we'll lasso all of the flowers I think there are flowers on the moon. I'm not 100 percent sure, but I'm 90 percent sure. Okay, maybe 80. [SINGING] I'll take my fragrance to The United Nations All the leaders of the world Will be in the room Then I will spritz my fabulous Signature smell Into the air conditioning vents And they'll forget for a sec Why they don't get along And they'll find peace Through my perfume I mean, let's be real, I don't get how diplomacy works, but I think this could work. I've got a smell in my mind I'm gonna let it loose on the world I know that my fragrance Will make a real difference 'Cause a scent is worth a thousand words [DOLPHIN CLICKING] You're fired. Okay. Fired. [CAR HORNS HONKING AND TIRES SCREECHING] Ooh. Didn't see that coming. [TIRES SCREECHING AND CAR HORNS HONKING] But it's okay. That's in the past. It's just gonna make it that much sweeter when my dream really does come true. Wait a second. That's in the future. Okay, stay in the present, Lola. There's tons to be grateful for here in the present. Like what? I can't think of anything to be grateful for. I feel like my world is collapsing. I can't breathe. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Whew. Okay. Okay. I gotta think of one little thing to be grateful for. I know. It's a beautiful, sunny day. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Really? Hey! Hey! [YELLING] [GRUNTING] [WHISTLES] [TIRES SCREECH] What's up, doc? Oh, no, I'm not a doctor. I'm a perfume salesperson. Well, I used to be. I just got fired. Sorry to hear that. Where to? - Home, please. - Address? You know what? It'll be easier if I direct you. Just head downtown. Okay, take a left up here. It'll be quicker, I promise. Okay, now a sharp right. Good. Alrighty, turn left into this alley. - Really? - Yeah. Just gun it through. Okay, give me a second. I just wanna get a lay of the land. Okay, we're good. [POLICE SIRENS WAILING AND WOMAN SCREAMING] - Now you're gonna wanna make a U-turn... - Are you sure you know where you're going? I think I know how to get home. I go there every day. Okay, go right over here. You're gonna want to turn around, sorry. Left, left, left, one more right. I don't know this area. Can you just do a quick U-turn? And we're here. [SHIP HORN BLOWING] BUGS: Which boat is yours? Wait a second. This is where I used to live. Lola, you're not a barge captain anymore. - You were a barge captain? - Yeah, for seven years. Or was that I dream I had? Anyway, you probably need to make another one of those U-turns... ...because I live really far from here. [BUGS GRUNTS] 14th Street, between 6th and 7th. And that's all I'm gonna say. You're the cab driver, I'm gonna let you do your job. You are not gonna hear another peep out of me. Not gonna say another single word. What's that picture? That's where I used to live. In fact we're actually right next to it. There you go. That's where it was. Until the city decided the one thing it needed was another high rise. Wow. I can tell this is really, really very hard. Very emotional. So I'm not gonna ask you any more questions. What made you decide to become a cab driver? Are you kidding? It's great. I'm my own boss, I choose who I pick up, who I don't. Sometimes I make the wrong choice. Doesn't it get lonely? Driving around with a bunch of strangers? I like it that way. It's like being invisible in a city full of millions. [TIRES SCREECH THEN LOLA SCREAMS] That'll be $24.97. I didn't charge you for your little shortcut. Oh, my gosh, that is so nice of you. - Ah. Oh, no. - What? I must have left my purse at work. Don't worry, I have money upstairs. I have a cash jar. That I keep in the microwave. It's a really small apartment. B-R-B. Promise. You better. The meter's running. [BEEPS] What? Where's my cash jar? Ah. That's right, I kept accidentally cooking it so I moved it to my hat drawer. [SPEEDY SPEAKS IN SPANISH AND LOLA SCREAMS] [IN ENGLISH] Seriously? Lola, I've been your landlord for five years. When are you gonna stop screaming every time you see me? Sorry. I just never get used to it. I got something for you. Speedy, I'm so touched. I know how much you like flowers and smells and that stuff. So I was in Mexico, and I thought I'd pick it up. - When were you in Mexico? - Oh, about a half hour ago. It's beautiful. Legend says it only blooms once every 200 years... ...high atop the Sierra Guadalupe. It bloomed today. That smell... It's so inspiring. It's perfect. Oh, don't mind me, I'll let myself out. Don't offer me a glass of water. It's not like I ran 2500 miles carrying an object three times my size. No big deal. Remember, rent is due tomorrow. You're not listening. I'll be back saying, "Where's your rent?" You'll say, "I forgot. Sorry, here it is." We do it every time. Whatever. Remember, rent is due tomorrow. [BEEPING] Well, I can afford to wait, but I'm not sure she can. [JACKHAMMER POUNDING AND GLASS BREAKING] Is it a drone? If it is, it's faster than any drone we've got. We can't... I say we can't lose that flower. We've mapped the trajectory and know where it ended up. Russia? China? New York City. 1000 W. 14th Street, apartment 12 to be exact. - We've got her. - Her? Get me Fudd. Here's Fudd. I thought I fired you. You can't fire an intern. FOGHORN: Hello... I say hello, Fudd. Now, just listen up a minute, son. I say I got... I got a little problem here. [KEYPAD BEEPING] There's been a development. I don't have the flower... ...but I know who does. [SNORING] [SNIFFING] Hmm. That clove's coming on a little strong. A little clove goes a long way. All right, let's see here. Maybe just a smidge of geranium. [SNIFFS] Mm, mommy, that's nice. I have the rabbit in my sights. FOGHORN: What about the flower? Still there. Okay, son, stick with her like a tick on a coonhound. - What? - Just watch her. Okay, I've got the base where I want it. And now the secret weapon. Here goes nothing. [SNIFFS] OMG. OMG. I did it. I created my fragrance. She did it. She created invisibility. Well, what are you...? I say, what are you talking to me for, son? Get in there. It smells so good. Oh, I can't believe it. Everyone's gonna want this. Ooh. Ow! Right in the eye. Ooh, that really stung. They'll have to put a warning on the bottle: "Close eyes before spraying." Ooh, I wonder what the bottle's gonna look like. I wonder what I'm gonna call it. Ooh! This perfume's gonna be huge. [BANGING ON DOOR] Who could that be? That poor cab driver. Sorry, I'm coming. I got a little sidetracked creating the world's most beautiful fragrance. LOLA: Ah! [MEN GRUNTING] Whoa! Ah! [LOLA SCREAMING] Ooh! Ugh! Drive. I drive when I decide to drive. [GUNSHOTS] I just decided to drive. Huh? [GRUNTS] You wanna tell me what is going on? You wanna know what's going on? I'll tell you. - I'll tell you what's going on. - Can it be sometime today? The cosmetics industry is made up of sharks. Not actual sharks, that would be weird. It'd be amazing though. Sharks never stop swimming so they'd never stop making cosmetics. What does this have to do with being shot at? Ten minutes ago I created the most beautiful fragrance. I know that sounds braggy but it's a fact. I know perfume. And I also know that this bottle is worth millions. Maybe billions. And everyone who's anyone in the beauty industry is gonna want it. I bet they were spying on me from the apartment across the street. No one was spying on you. I've been working on creating this fragrance for years. Surely I'm on everyone's radar in the cosmetics industry. - I'm probably being bugged right now. - Oh, no. I'm the one being bugged. Okay, you know what? Drive to Paris. You can't drive to Paris. You have to fly. Then take me to the airport. [TIRES SCREECHING] I'm not taking you anywhere. Please. I have to get this to the House of Moufette before someone steals it from me. You're gonna have to get there with someone else's help. Argh. Is this about the money I owe you? What was it, 20 bucks? - You're not gonna help me over 20 bucks? - Not that I'm counting but, uh... Good thing I'm gonna be rich. Look, I promise I'll pay you. Aah! There's a bank. We can do it right now. - Trust me, this isn't about the money. - I insist. My mother taught me, "Always repay your debts." Or was it "brush your hair before bed"? No, because these are my ears. It was always repay your debts. BUGS: Whoa! We can assume they're working together. They have the same last name so they're probably a husband-wife crime team. Or brother-sister. I'm just saying. Well, whoever they are they're about to be famous. REPORTER [ON TV]: The suspects are at large and considered dangerous. The State Department is offering a reward of $500,000... ...for any information leading to their capture. "Give me all your money and no one gets blasted to smithereens." Smithereens? She ain't gonna know what that is. These are city folk. Hmm. Maybe "bits." "Blasted to bits." That's got a ring to it. Course it's a squirt gun. Come on, Sam, don't doubt yourself. "Blasted to bits" it is. Is that right? That don't look right. Next customer. Hold your horses, girlie. That don't look right either. I'm running out of room here. - Uh, sir? - Dad-gummit. You can't rush a bank robbery. [ALL GASP] MAN: What? REPORTER: State Department... Uh, I mean... Do you want it in 50s or 20s? Or a bunch of 10s? I love a 10. Maybe you're more of a coin guy? Coins jangling in your pocket? I don't care. Whatever. TELLER: Next customer. LOLA: Uh... - Okay. - We gotta get out of here. LOLA: Huh? Huh? Huh? Ooh. Huh? [CHUCKLING] LOLA: What about your money? Get in the cab. SAM: You're not a-going anywhere. Now get in the truck. I thought you just said we're not a-going anywhere. - What? - You said "You're not a-going anywhere"... ...so do you want us to go anywhere or not a-go anywhere? Ooh! Then I mean go anywhere. And by "anywhere" I mean "my truck." My lord, I've known you all of two seconds. It feels like you've been bugging me my whole life. Imagine how I feel. Is that you on those mud flaps? It was a side business. I took a bath on those things. - You want a set? - I'm good. Get in. DISPATCHER: What is the nature of your emergency? I gots the two most wanted rabbits in the country, and I wants my 500 grand. What's your location? Times Square. Right in front of the bank I was gonna rob. Forget that last part. [POLICE SIRENS WAILING] That's impressive response time. [GUNS COCKING] Hand over the rabbits. Hand over the money. You'll get your reward when we have the suspects in custody. Suspects? What are we suspected of? We're not a "we." I don't know what you're involved in, but I haven't done anything. Nice try, government man. I wants my money first. You don't know what you're dealing with. You'll get your reward, I promise. Oh, like the IRS promised not to garnish my wages? They a-garnished them. Now give me my 500 G's. Forget about the money, what she's got is the most valuable thing on the planet. Well, that's very flattering. Most valuable thing on the planet? Then the price just went up. I wants a zillion dollars, and I wants it now or I'm a-gonna shoot. - What? - What? It's just a water pistol. But I'm a-feeling boxed in. And when I'm boxed in I gots to shoot my way out. Yee-ha! Yee-ha! Hmm. Guns really do have a way of escalating a situation. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? It's me. You seem to have left your purse here when I fired you. Oh, thank goodness. Giovanni, listen to me. I did it. I created my perfume and it is perfect. I'm trying to get to Paris but everyone's after me. I always knew the cosmetics industry was cutthroat... ...but I thought that was an expression. Whoever it is, they're willing to kill me for it. Lola, no one's trying to kill you for your fragrance. Oh, really? [GUNFIRE] Call the House of Moufette, tell them Lola Bunny has their next fragrance... ...and she is on her way. Ah! [LOLA SCREAMING] [KEYPAD BEEPING THEN LINE RINGS] Is this the House of Moufette? I'm calling to let you know that your next big fragrance is on its way. Who created it? That would be me: Giovanni Jones. Now I just need to find Lola. - Come on. - Sure you don't have to make another call? Whoa! [BOTH GRUNTING] What, are you crazy? Trust me, okay? I know my way around the New York City sewage system. I know I'm gonna regret asking this, but why? Okay. Well, about a year ago I read on the Internet: "Ten surprising foods that will supercharge your day"... ...and one of them was hotdogs. So every day I would stop at the same hot-dog vendor... ...and get a hot dog. But then one day I read: "Ten unsurprising foods no one should be eating"... ...and hot dogs were number one. Well, obviously I couldn't keep eating hot dogs... ...but I still had to walk past the hot-dog vendor to get to work. I just couldn't face him. His sad little hot-dog-vendor face. But that was the only way to get to work. - Or so I thought. - So you took the sewer to work? Mm-hm. No fuss, no muss. Well, actually a lot of muss. Tons of muss. Okay, we're gonna have to get down on our bellies for this part. Heh, heh, heh. No, no, no. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on. I told you. They want my perfume. It's gonna be the most popular fragrance in the world. It'll be everywhere. That's all that matters. I don't care about the money. You can have it. - I don't want your money. - Are you sure? You'd be able to buy that building and tear it down... ...and go back to living in that little hole and being alone. Isn't that what you want? - Yes, but... - Then come on. - Lola, listen to me. - Whoops. Lola, those were the feds back there. The feds don't want your perfume. You're obviously mixed up in something that you don't understand. But whatever it is, it's big. Bugs, I told you. The cosmetics industry is a billion-dollar industry. How am I gonna get that perfume? She could be anywhere. BUGS: I promise you this has nothing to do with the cosmetics industry. No one, and I mean no one, is trying to steal your perfume and take it to Paris. I'm off to Paris. My perfume. Giovanni's got my perfume. We've got to stop him. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] No way. I'm done. Look, you're on your own. Come on, come on. Green means go. [CAR HORN HONKS] Oh. Ha-ha-ha. I'd rather take my chances with the FBI than follow you from one mess to another. Well, I have to get my perfume back. That is one nutty rabbit. [CAR HORN HONKS] [TIRES SCREECH THEN LOLA SCREAMS] You're not gonna go after her. Oh, brother. Taxi! Follow that van. Whoa, man. I don't give people rides. What are you talking about? This is a taxi. But it's for my transportation needs only. - How do you make money? - My salary. Taxi drivers don't make a salary. You only make money by giving people rides. Ah, that's why I'm broke. All right, where to? Follow that van! [TIRES SCREECHING AND CAR HORN HONKING] So where are you from? Are you crazy? Legally? No. There's not a word for my condition. [MEN GASP AND SCREAM] Coming up on your left you'll notice the famed Statue of Liberty. - That's the Empire State Building. - Well, it has many nicknames. Right up here on our right you're gonna get a glimpse of the majestic St. Louis Arches. There's just the one. And it's in St. Louis. See, this is why I don't give rides. [TIRES SCREECHING] [TIRES SCREECHING] That'll be $7000. What? You never even turned the meter on. I don't know how to work that. I do it in my head. Wait here. Where are you going? To see if they have a bathroom. I'm on this crazy, Internet, hot-dog diet. Ugh. Just a little burbly. CECIL: She says she doesn't have it. She says someone named Giovanni has it and he's on his way to Paris. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PHONE] Eliminate her? LOLA: Hm? Oh, well, I didn't know we'd be eliminating people, but that's fine. Okay, I understand. But maybe I should be paid a little more than we agreed on... ...because eliminating people is definitely a very illegal activity... ...and I'm not very comf... [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PHONE] Oh, okay, so my life could be in jeopardy and you'll have me eliminated? I understand. Well, in that case, I think we can stick with the original deal. [DIAL TONE] Hello? Hello? Hm. Doesn't even say goodbye. All right. Eliminate her. [BEEP] [LOLA GRUNTING] [MUFFLED SCREAMING] I'm just curious, um, how much are you guys getting paid for this? Oh, you don't wanna tell me? I just wanna make sure we're all getting the same amount. Fine. Don't tell me. But all I know is, I'm not getting paid enough to watch someone get smelted in a smelter. Now, let's get ourselves to Paris and find this Giovanni. - Over there. - The bathroom? BUGS: Shut off the machine! Hm. [BEEPING] How's that? [LOLA SCREAMS] That's not it. [BEEPING] DAFFY: How about now? [LOLA SCREAMS] Nope. How's this? [LOLA SCREAMS] BUGS: Not great. [LOLA SCREAMING] DAFFY: Oh, I bet it's this one. Doesn't one of them say "on-off"? Yeah. Well, could you press that one? [DING] Ah. [GASPS] [LOLA SCREAMING] [BEEPING] [LOLA SCREAMING] [LOLA SCREAMING] Oh, Bugs. I just knew you'd save me. Not as much as I knew I'd get smelted... ...but I pretty much really was hoping you were gonna save me. And you did. You mean "we." Daffy Duck. Sorry about the wet hand. Just washed them. Found the bathroom. Surprisingly nice. Come on, we have to get to the airport and find Giovanni before they do. An airport run? This guy already owes me $7000. SAM: Now wait a doggone second. You're a-telling me that not only do I get no reward... ...I'm a-getting charged with attempted bank robbery? Be quiet. Yes, general. I'm afraid we lost the rabbits. First off, why is "attempted" bank robbery illegal? If I just attempted it, it means I didn't get it done. Do you see me sitting on piles of money from the bank I robbed? No. Because I didn't rob it. I was just attempting it. And you're the only reason them rabbits got away. I'm well aware this is a matter of national security. SAM: Ugh. Hey, government man. Yes, sir, we're looking everywhere, sir. Baldy. Coming up on our left you'll notice the Washington Monument. That's in Washington. [SIGHS] Is that that hillbilly leprechaun that tried to kidnap us? Huh? [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] - Step on it. - Okey-dokey, but it's gonna cost you extra. [SIREN WAILS] - What about the airport? - Right now we've got bigger fish to fry. [SIRENS WAILING] Speaking of fish, if you'll look to your right, you'll see the famed Fisherman's Wharf. There's Old Faithful. Ooh. Look at that. The Space Needle. Well, look at that. - Ha, ha. Remember the Alamo. - Ah! [ALL GASPING] [ALL GASP] [TIRES SCREECHING] Huh? Hoo-hoo-hoo. It's easier this way. [CRASH] Nope. Harder. BUGS: Come on. We can lose them in here. - Oh, great idea. - Why are you coming? - It's not every day... - ...a person gets to see the Grand Canyon. - This is Central Park. I thought that was in Michigan. Bugs. This way. [DAFFY LAUGHING] [MONKEY SCREECHING AND DAFFY LAUGHING] [DAFFY GRUNTS AND MONKEYS SCREECHING] [CHUCKLING] Climb in. Aw. So romantic. I didn't know you thought of me in that way. I'm not gonna lie, there's obviously some chemistry here... ...and you are easy on the eyes. Sorry, doc, we gotta get to the airport. Oh, right, yeah, airport. [HORSE NEIGHS] [QUACKING] Let me ask you something. These ducks, they just live here? Rent free? Meals, everything taken care of? [MAN GRUNTS] Interesting. [SIREN WAILS] Unbelievable. Never got my one phone call. Who would I call? I don't have anyone to call. But that's not the point. Point is you get a phone call. [HORSE NEIGHING] Well, well, well. Finally these little doll's hands is good for something. [TIRES SCREECHING] [LOLA CLEARS THROAT] BUGS: Are you kidding? Oh, brother. [TIRES SCREECH THEN HORSE NEIGHS] There he is. One ticket to Paris, please. [SCANNERS WHIRRING] - Come on. - What do you think you're doing? - Duh. We have to get on that flight to Paris. - Paris, eh? We're wanted criminals. We try and buy a ticket, they'll arrest us. - Well, then what are we supposed to do? - Hm. I think I've got an idea. SAM: One ticket to Paris. Down here. Oh, I'm sorry. That'll be $2165 dollars and 38 cents. I don't want to buy the plane, I just want to ride on it. Durn, I regret not robbing that bank. [WOMAN CLEARS THROAT] [GRUNTS] How am I gonna get on that plane without a ticket? [DOG BARKING] Ugh. That's the last time I take the Van Wyck. Okay, you two get us tickets to Paris... ...I'm gonna pop into the duty-free shop. What? I need some bronzing powder. [CECIL HUMMING AND DOG BARKING] CECIL: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Can someone tip me over, please? Anyone? Someone? Anyone? I know you can see me. Hello. BUGS [IN FEMALE VOICE]: Welcome to flight 418 nonstop to Paris. Our flight time is approximately seven hours and 16 minutes. Dinner will be served shortly, so sit back, relax and enjoy your flight. Okay, you know there are male flight attendants. Yeah, but I like the height the heels give me. - How will we get the perfume? - He's gotta go to the bathroom. - We'll get it then. - What if he never uses the bathroom? It's a seven hour flight. Maybe we need a little insurance. Here you go. One jumbo oat bran muffin with a side of dried prunes... ...a couple boxes of raisins, some assorted melon... ...seven or eight fiber wafers, and a large cup of black coffee. Can I get you anything else? - I thought I ordered the chicken. - We're all out of the chicken. I predict a bathroom break in five... ...four... ...three... ...two... ...one. [STOMACH RUMBLING] - He took the perfume. - Relax. - We'll think of something. - Excuse me, is the bathroom occupied? Ugh. The one in the back is definitely occupied. Oh, no, help yourself. Bugs, that's the turtle. The one that tried to smelt me. We've gotta get that perfume before he does. Thank you. I shouldn't, but do you have any more peanuts? [CECIL HUMMING] [TOILET FLUSHES THEN GIOVANNI SIGHS] [GIOVANNI CHUCKLING] Aah! Oh, it's just so frustrating. It's right there. Ah, I've got it. I'll take this fork and jab it into his thigh, you take that scalding coffee... ...and just... Just, pour it right in his face. [GRUNTING] - What, you want to do the fork? - Just sit down. Excuse me sir, but we're about to experience some turbulence ahead... ...so I'm gonna need to collect any loose items you might have. Okay, and what about your pockets? - What? - I'm gonna need you to empty your pockets. So nothing jabs you, with all the turbulence. It's an FAA regulation. You'll get it back. Buckle up. - You got it? - I got it. Ooh! I also got a ton of duty-free stuff from that turtle. Oh, that's some really good bronzer. [ALL SNORING] MAN: Excuse me, ladies? BOTH: Huh. Shouldn't you two be awake? Yeah, but shouldn't you be flying the plane? I don't want to alarm you, we got word that Interpol... ...will meet us at the runway when we land. No one is to de-plane until they come aboard. Apparently we have two wanted fugitives on our flight. [BOTH GASP] - Any questions? - I have one. Who do you think built Stonehenge? I think aliens. Heh, heh, heh. We don't have any questions. Hm. We gotta hide. Follow me. We'll stay down here and sneak out with the bags. You ain't gonna sneak nowhere. You're gonna give me that thing everyone's after you for that I don't know what it is. You want this? Well, guess what little man. - You're gonna have to fight me for it. - I ain't afraid to hit a girl. Neither am I. Oh! [SAM GRUNTING] Yee-ha! SAM: Argh! LOLA: Oh! SAM: Unh! BUGS: Oh! [SAM LAUGHING] Huh? No! No! No! Gotcha. Oh, that was close. I thought I was in real trouble there for a second. Aah! Grab onto me! What are you doing? Bugs, those are other people's things. Maybe cab drivers don't make a lot of money... ...doesn't mean you can steal other people's clothes. You don't even wear pants. LOLA: Oh. Incredible. Oh, come on. I was just going on instinct. - Anyone would've done the same thing. - No, not you, this blouse. So how do I look? Excuse me, have you seen those flight attendants? - Keep it moving. - But they have something of mine. Well, that's the last of them. No sign of the suspects. That's impossible. Search it again. I'm just saying it would've been nice if you had parachuted us to a resort or a hotel. - I mean, they're tons of them in France. - Quiet. - What? - I don't think we're alone. OMG. - We're saved! - We're surrounded by sharks! Those are dolphins. And fortunately for us, I speak dolphin. [LOLA CLICKING] I just told them to go get help, get a nice yacht, a big one with a Jacuzzi. [SHARK GROWLS] - These are some dumb dolphins. - You're crazy, you know that? I should've never picked you up. I was perfectly content living my life on my own... ...and now I'm gonna get eaten by a fish with a lunatic by my side! [SHIP HORN BLOWING] Told you. Thanks dolphins. Sorry for calling you dumb. Oh, I mean: [CLICKING] [SHARK GROWLS] [KEYPAD BEEPING] Yes, this is Giovanni Jones. I have an appointment to see Mr. Moufette... ...but there's been a slight complication... ...and I might need a little more time. Hang up. I believe you have something we want. MAC: How positively fortuitous. Here you are trying to get to Paris... And we're on our way to Paris. [BOTH LAUGHING] Now enough chitchat. I want to see that perfume we've been hearing so much about. Now don't judge it by the bottle, it's all I had. But I know that Mr. Moufette will have a million wonderful ideas. - I mean, I don't even have a name yet. - What about Lola? It has a certain ring to it. Oh, no. Pfft. I couldn't name it after myself. Well, why ever not? You created it. It's your fragrance. Come on, give us a spritz. [GASPS] My heavens! TOSH: My heavens is right. Oh, this scent is out of this world! And so are you! TOSH: What? - You've disappeared! That's why everyone wants this. You invented invisibility! [LOLA SIGHS] Invisibility. Do you have any idea what this means? Yes. It means my perfume is a disaster. What are you talking about? A fragrance is supposed to make you stand out, not disappear. Forget the fragrance. You invented the most powerful thing maybe in the history of the world. I am ever so sorry, and I hate to be a bother... ...but there is still that little matter of, ahem... ...my friend having vanished! TOSH: What on earth is everyone talking about? Where are you, Tosh? TOSH: I'm right here. Where? TOSH: Aah! BUGS: And now we know water washes it off. - Whatever has gotten into you? - You were invisible. Oh, here we go again. This is what our therapist was talking about. - I'm always invisible to you. - I beg your pardon. No. Remember Keith said, "No one is always anything." Oh, fine. I am usually invisible to you. Why? Because I ignored your advice about my mother? Cut the cord, Mac. I told you I am going to stop sending her money. - You say that every month. - I have to do it on my terms... - ...and on my timetable. - Cut the cord, Mac. MAC: I am working with Keith on this. TOSH: You lied to my face. MAC: What are you talking about? TOSH: You said you've not been in contact... - ...and you've been in contact! - How do you know that? Aah! Have you looked at my phone? Oh, don't you turn this around on me. The woman said she hated me. Hated! Those are just words! Words are weapons, Mac. Cut the cord! BUGS: What's up, doc? - Hmm? I told you, I'm not a doctor. I don't know what I am anymore. Well, you're about to become the most famous person in the world. Think of all the possibilities this offers. Whenever you want, you can go totally unnoticed. It's the ultimate in being left alone. Invisibility is a dream come true. Maybe that's your dream. It's not mine. Maybe it's time you had a new dream. Look at that. The most romantic city in the world. And thanks to your invention, it can all be yours. One night. What do you say? I don't have anything to wear. You do realize we'll be invisible? Oh. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Makeover! - Makeover! [BOTH LAUGH] [SINGING] There's nothing quite as sweet As a woman's inner beauty A sparkle from within Is a lady's call of duty Your brains, your class, your winning smile These things cannot be bought But how to wear a killer dress Can certainly be taught - F - Can you feel it? - A - All right, now - B - Bust it out - U - You know it - L - You love it - O - Oh, my - U - You following this? - S - I said I'm so fabulous You're so fabulous - We're so fabulous - We're so fabulous - We're so fabulous - We're so fabulous Girl... Girl, you're fabulous No time to waste It's getting late You've got to look your best A flawless look from head to toe To stand out from the rest A gathered waist A mermaid hem A bustier's to die And, girl, you know there's no such thing As over-accessorized - F - Oh, boy. - Can you feel it? - A All right, now - B - Bust it out - U - You know it - L - You love it - O - Oh, my - U - You following this? - S - I said I'm so fabulous You're so fabulous - We're so fabulous - We're so fabulous - We're so fabulous - We're so fabulous Rhinestones, crystals, gold lam? Who says you can't wear fur? And when in doubt, a kitten heel Will always make you purr A pouty lip, a contoured cheek A smoky eye's a plus Extend your lash, then arch your brow And you'll look fabulous - F - Can you feel it? - A - All right, now - B - Bust it out - U - You know it - L - You love it - O - Oh, my - U - You following this? - S - I said I'm so fabulous She's so fabulous - We're so fabulous - We're so fabulous - We're so fabulous - We're so fabulous BUGS: Girl, you're fabulous. - Well, how do I look? - Beautiful. Seems a shame to do this, but... - Have fun! - Don't do anything we wouldn't do! Well, that's not much now, is it? [BOTH LAUGHING] TOSH: Oh, you do need to cut that cord though. MAC: I know. ALL: Huh? [POLICE SIREN WAILING] [HORN HONKING THEN BOTH GASP] [HORN HONKING] [BOTH GASP] [BOTH SCREAMING THEN GRUNT] [ALL GASP] [CAR HORNS HONKING] [CAR HORN HONKS THEN TIRES SCREECH] [BOTH GASP] [GASPS] [BANGING AND CRASHING] [CAR HORNS HONKING AND ALARMS RINGING] BUGS: You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. LOLA: What are you talking about? I'm invisible. - You can't see me at all. - I see you. [POLICE SIRENS WAILING] [GUNS COCKING] You two, freeze. It's over. Now give me the bottle. - Sorry. - They had guns. Why should you guys have it? It's hers. - She invented it. - It's too powerful a weapon. It can't end up in the wrong hands. Now give us the bottle or we'll shoot. [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS AND MEN GRUNTING] I'm afraid the only shooting around here is gonna be done by us. Who are you? Let's just say I'm working for someone who wants that more than you. You have two options. Hand over the bottle, or I shoot you. Or is that one option? "Hand over the bottle or I shoot you." Oh. I guess that's one option. Looks like you only have one option. Really? What about this option? CECIL: Oh! ELMER: Don't do it. LOLA: No! [SAM SNIFFING] Huh? SAM: Argh! - Fifi! I got it. I finally got that thing... ...that I don't know what it is that everybody wants... ...that's worth more money than I'd know what to do with. Oh, boy. [FISTS THUMPING AND ALL GRUNTING] If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. I was just about to get that for you. [SNAPS] You're Martians too? Oh, I bet you are getting paid more than me. You're a Martian? MARVIN: Not just any Martian. Marvin the Martian. What do you want with invisibility? MARVIN: It's quite simple really. The Earth obstructs my view of Venus... ...so I'm going to make it invisible. What? But if everything was invisible... ...wouldn't there be confusion? Cars would crash into each other, planes would collide, people would die. MARVIN: I know. It would be a lot easier just to blow it up. But I seem to have misplaced the Illudium Q-36 Space Modulator... ...so plan B. I didn't know you were going to make the whole world invisible. I mean, that's got to be as illegal a thing to do as a person can think of. I should be getting a ton more money. What? Oh, goody. It really does work. [SNIFFS] But first I need to get rid of that putrid scent. Putrid? Putrid means bad, right? MARVIN: Now, where is that separator? I always misplace the separator. Aha. [CRACKLING] Oh, goody. Now I have one super-concentrated bottle of invisibility. And one bottle of... Whatever you call this. It's called Lola. And that's the wrong one. MARVIN: What are you talking about, foolish Earth creature? BUGS: This is the one you want, it's the original. MARVIN: It is? No harm done. I'll take this one and give you this one. - No, not that one. - Here we go. BUGS: No, that's okay, you keep this one, I'll take that. That's right. I'll take this one. That's right. You take that, I'll take this. [MARVIN GRUNTING] [MARVIN WHIMPERING] And there you are, sir. And remember, the Acme Company guarantees complete customer satisfaction. MARVIN: Well, thank you. You don't see that type of personalized service very often these days. Hey. This isn't... Get them! [BOTH SCREAMING] [ALL SCREAMING] [BOTH SCREAMING] [ALL SCREAMING] MARVIN: Aha. [GRUNTING] [CECIL PANTING] [ALL GRUNTING] MARVIN: Stop right there, Earth creatures. - Lock them in the Captivator. - What? MARVIN: The Captivator. The place where you hold someone captive. It's... Hmm, where is it? I could've sworn it was right over there. Forget it. Everyone stand over there, and if you move again I'll vaporize you. CECIL: Huh? MARVIN: You too. What? I thought we had a deal. Aw. I should have listened to my mother. She always said never trust a Martian. MARVIN: I'll deal with you later. [BEEPING] And now it's time to say goodbye to your precious Earth. [BEEP] BUGS: Eh, hey, doc? MARVIN: Mm-hm? If you're not gonna do anything with this perfume... ...mind if I give it to the girl? Seeing as how it was her life-long dream? MARVIN: Do what you want. Because soon I will be placing you all in the Eliminator... ...which is right over there. Huh? Oh, you've got to be kidding me. How do you lose an Eliminator? [BEEPING] Oh, goody, it's ready. What happened? BUGS: Oh. Were you wanting something to disappear? Oh. Shoot them. Oh! BUGS: I'll take those. CECIL: This way. [FOOTSTEPS RUNNING] MARVIN: I am so angry. LOLA: You switched the bottles? BUGS: Ain't I a stinker? Whoa, what's this? "Illudium Q-36 Space Modulator." CECIL: Hurry. BUGS: Hey, Marvin. Catch. Oh. Why, thank you. I've been looking for that. I hate Earthlings. [GASPS THEN PANTING] [ALL GASPING] Fifi. I was so worried about you. Fifi, come back. Fifi! [GRUNTING] [PANTING] Where's the bottle? In there. Well, it's probably for the best. I don't think the world is quite ready for invisibility. Well, it looks like you guys got this under control... ...so I should probably be on my way. Really? You're a turtle. I'm going to catch you. CECIL: Huh? Ah! Oh, Lola, can you ever forgive me? Of course I forgive you. Oh, thank you. - Hug? - Don't push it. [SNIFFS] Do you smell that? I guess your dream came true. You brought your fragrance to the whole world. - I'm sorry your dream didn't. - What was my dream? Getting to be all alone. Maybe it's time I had a new dream. SPEEDY: Lola? Speedy? What are you doing here? I'm getting my morning croissant. What are you doing here? You don't pay rent, but you can take a romantic trip to Paris with your boyfriend? Ay-yay-yay. I'm going to Switzerland for some hot chocolate. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Ladies and gentlemen... ...it is my great privilege to introduce to you... ...the head of the House of Moufette... ...Monsieur Le Pew. Oh, my little bottle of love. Oh. Excuse moi, my audience, she awaits. [SPEAKS IN FRENCH] [IN ENGLISH] Before I unveil our latest fragrance... ...I wish to say a few words. One year ago, for a brief moment... ...the most unforgettable scent covered the world... ...and I feared that we would never smell something that beautiful again. But I was wrong. After all, this scent was created by the same woman. I give you... ...Lola. [CAMERAS CLICKING] What is the word, doctor? Oh, what, I did it wrong? Sorry. - How was your day? - Busy, just the way I like it. - How was yours? - Not busy, just the way I like it. So, what you wanna do tonight? - I thought we could go to the game. - It's the playoffs, it's sold out. Eh, we'll get in. Trust me. How? Is that what I think it is? You've had it this whole time? - Have you been using it? - No. Well, maybe one time. A couple of times. Eh, I use it a lot. [QUACKING] DAFFY: Hey, kid. Go get me a corn dog, will you? [SCREAMING] What's your name? [QUACKS] That's a stupid name. [STAMMERING] That's all, folks. Interesting. [English - US - SDH] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
