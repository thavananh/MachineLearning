foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Do you have to rush off? Sorry, Cindy. I've got a lot of important things to take care of. Oh, all right. I know the drill. Hit it and quit it. You're a call girl, Cindy. What else do you expect? True. But I'm a call girl with a beautiful house. That's right. You must be raking in some serious cash. Eh, I do all right. But speaking of cash. Right. I don't think I have what you're looking for today. Excuse me? Will this do? You're a cop? I know, it's a drag, but we did have a great time together. You never even intended to pay me. I had to gather some hard evidence. You bastard. You tricked me. You're the trick, Cindy. Not me. I'll get you for this. My lawyer will have me out in an hour. I don't think so, sweetheart. It's your 36th offense and this is a three dozen strike state. I'll be out faster than Lindsay Lohan. You'll see. Come on, let's go. What are you in for? Huh? I said, what are you in for? Oh, me? Prostitution. But I won't be in for long. I've got a really good attorney. Lucky you. So what are you in for? Fighting. Fighting? Like fighting fighting? Yeah, I kicked a girl's ass, but it was rigged. A sting, a setup. Really? A setup? Me too. I was set up just like you. Yeah, but you're a hooker, not a fighter. I get paid to make war, not love. You are nothing like me. Maybe so, but you look more like a hooker than I do. How dare you! You're a bitch. Back off, skank! God, get off me! You messed with the wrong girl. Get off me! God, you crazy bitch! Do not mess with me! Hey, hey, hey. Stop it this instant. Not here for 30 minutes and you've already started a riot. She asked for it. Shut up. And Sasha, that means three hours are added onto your sentence. I'll fix you for this. You just wait and see. Bite me, hose bag. Come with me. Stand over there, prisoner. Prisoner? Can't you just call me Cindy? Prisoner sounds so final. Shut up, prisoner. Shutting up, sir. You're a pretty one. They'll like you here. Well, I've been known to get on good with others. I'm sure. Now strip. Strip? You heard me, cupcake. Strip. Now what? Take these and be quick with it. Oh, for a second there I thought we were gonna have rough jailhouse sex. That comes later after you've showered. Oh, right. I should have been able to figure that one out on my own. Follow me. Yes? Here she is. Oh. That'll be all for now, Matron. You can wait outside. All right. Please have a seat. Thanks. Whew. Cindy, this does not look good for you. Not good at all. Warden, I swear I was set up. I didn't do anything at all. I blame society. Cindy, this is serious. You could be facing hard time. Hard time? Can't I just have what Paris Hilton got? I'm afraid not. That's only reserved for hardened criminals and celebrities. Oh. Think of it. Hard time. Your youth flittering away, your pretty face lined with wrinkles, your head full of gray hair, and no Brazilian waxing. What? Is that really what you want? Hell no. What can I do to get out of here? Hmm. There may be a way for you to get out of this jam you're in. Really? Yes, but there's something I'll need you to do for me. Is right here on the desk okay? No, no. Nothing like that, really. Oh, sorry. The police have a little project they've been working on and they could use someone like you on the inside. It's dangerous and you have to become a squealer for the feds, but it would get you outta here. A squealer for the feds? I don't think so. You should hear me out on this. No thanks, Warden. No deal. I've got a really good attorney. I'll take my chances with the justice system. Thank you. All right, Cindy, have it your way. Matron. Yes, Warden? Please escort the prisoner back to her cell. With pleasure. The judge will see you shortly. Where's Smoking Joe? We had to move her to another cell. She kept saying she was gonna kill you the first chance she got. You don't have to worry about me. I can take care of myself. Fair enough. Cindy Lou, what have you gotten yourself into this time? John, there you are. Thank God. What took you so long? I'm sorry. I just got the message from my secretary. Came as soon as I heard. Are you her attorney? I am. I hear you're very good. Is that what you've been telling them? Well, it's almost true. Excuse me, could I have a moment alone with my client please? Of course. I'll give you 20 minutes and your hearing's in an hour. Okay, so what's the plan? Cindy, I'm afraid your luck has run out. I don't know what you expect me to do at this point. You're supposed to get me out of here. Okay, tell 'em the jail's overcrowded. That always works. Okay, I've already been in one riot, forced lesbian sex, offered a deal to become a narc for the feds, and that was just since this morning. Wow. You should write a book. Okay, cut the comedy and get me outta here. Hmm. Cindy, I hate to bring this up at this delicate time, but in the three years that I've been defending you, you haven't paid me a single dime. Okay, look, I'm really sorry about that, but all my checkbooks are back at the house. Well, I guess I'm gonna have to make a tough decision then. I could stay and go into court with you or I could hop in my car and go across town and defend an ailing magazine conglomerate who's been involved in just a little Ponzi scheme. And they've got money? Oh, Jesus. They've got tons of money. All right, look, mouthpiece, you've gotta get me outta here. There's already a psycho bitch threatening to kill me. Can I put a down payment on your services? Down payment? I like the sound of that, but just what did you have in mind? See any collateral you like? Actually I do, but the minute you pull outta here, I'm gonna need some hard cash. Hey, that's my line. Counsel, I see that this is not the first time your client has been in this courtroom. We may have had the pleasure of meeting before. Young lady, you have been in this courtroom 36 times and always for the same offense. What do you have to say for yourself? I'm innocent by reason of insanity. Insanity? Well, I'm crazy about sex. Cindy, let me do the talking. Your Honor, it's clear that my client is not a dangerous criminal, nor does she pose a threat to the general public. Keeping her in jail would not be for the good of the community. The charge is prostitution. A very serious offense in this particular state. We understand the charge, your Honor, but my client has always paid her taxes, which are considerable. She volunteers at the local animal shelter. And on Thanksgiving, she serves dinner down on Skid Row. Please, I've heard it all before. I have no choice but to give you the maximum sentence allowable by law. The maximum sentence? What's that? I sentence you to a lifetime in prison without parole. You've gotta be kidding. A lifetime in prison? How long is that? Your Honor, doesn't that seem a bit harsh? No. Well, that's it for me then. What? Looks like I'm never gonna get paid now. Is that all you can think about? Cindy, please. Of course not. I'm still thinking about what a sweet ass you have. That'll cost you. You bastard. Put it on my bill. Goodbye, Cindy. It was great while it lasted. Enjoy your time in prison. Now what am I gonna do? Spend the rest of your life in prison, I suppose. What a pity. But you'll always have me. That's enough, Matron Grundy. You can leave now. This is so unfair. All I did was turn a few tricks. Perhaps you should reconsider my offer. There's still time. You think so? I do. In fact, I believe you're already familiar with this gentleman. Hey, you're that cop that got me busted in the first place. I had to, Cindy. It was the only way to gain your cooperation. Say that again. This whole thing, it was a setup to place you in a position where you'd be forced to help us. Why would I help you? You're the reason why I just got handed a life sentence. Help me and you walk out of here a free woman. Walk? Like a Nicole Richie? Yep. Or stay put like Bernie Madoff. So, what'll it be Cindy? Nicole or Bernie? What do I have to do? Here's the deal, Cindy. We've been eyeing a certain little strip bar downtown that we believe is a front for an illegal women's fight club. We gotta put an end to this, but we can't seem to get a girl on the inside. That's where you come in. Me? Why me? That little scuffle you had with Sasha earlier confirmed our suspicions. You can be pretty feisty when you want. And we also suspect Sasha may be part of the gang as one of their fighters. Dude, she wants to kill me. Great. Then you're already halfway there. You both are nuts. It's your only way outta here. All right, fine. I'll do it. I'll do it. Excellent, excellent. Let's get you outta here, prep for your new assignment. You won't regret this. You mean I won't live to regret it? Yeah, that's the spirit, baby. Well, look what the cat dragged in. Thanks for bailing me out. Well, what would you have me do? Let my best fighter rot in jail? No. Besides, you and I have, we have things to do. But you owe me. You owe me big. I know. So how's business? Business is good. It's better on fight night, but we're keeping our head above water. No thanks to you. What's that supposed to mean? It means you got caught. You don't ever want to get caught. You could have brought the police, the feds, you could have brought the goddamn IRS down on me, down on all of us. And that's not what I pay you for. I couldn't help myself. I got carried away. So you took the fights to the streets out where everyone could see you? I said I was sorry. Look, I'm a little hotheaded and that chick insulted me. You see, Sasha? That's your problem. You haven't learned to take a little humiliation and like it. And that costs me money. I'll make it up to you. You're damn right you will. And you know, I'm gonna do you a favor. I'm gonna reroute the way you think so we don't have this problem in the future. And how are you gonna do that? Take off your top. What? Take off your top or pay me my money and get out. What's it gonna be? That make you angry? What do you think? Good girl. Now let's find out between the two of us, which is the real boss around here. Take off your bottoms. Now you see how easy that was? And look at you. You're angry. You're seething. You'd like nothing more than to walk over here and kill me. But you're not gonna do that. You're gonna take one big step toward me and you're gonna give me a deep passionate kiss and you're gonna be a better woman for it. You better hope so, for your own sake. Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. Are you with me, Cindy? I'm here. You're just boring me. Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe you'd be more interested in stamping out license plates. Maybe I would be. So what's your brilliant plan, hot shot? I think we plant you into the club and you work your way through in confidence. How am I supposed to do that? I don't know. Pick a fight with one of the waitresses, throw a few punches. Maybe they'll recruit you. Just like that? Just like that. What if my cover gets blown? Cindy, you're a prostitute. What cover do you have to blow? True. But what if they find out I'm working for the feds, then my goose will be cooked. Don't panic, okay? I'll keep a close eye on you. Anyone tries to kill you, I'll jump right in. That's a very comforting thought, Roger. When do you want me to start? The sooner the better. We'll meet up tonight. Marvelous. Time to train. Train? You're serious? Put these on. You gotta get into shape. I should knock you out. You're more than welcome to try. Nice. Good, good. Buy you a drink? I don't take drinks from strangers. What's your name? Jake. I own the bar. Well, we're not strangers anymore then. I'd like a red wine, please. Bartender. Two. So, we don't get a lot of single women in here. You looking for a job dancing? No, I'm out celebrating. Really? Do tell. I just got out of jail. Now that is a reason to celebrate. Let's raise a glass. Cheers. Oh, you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. It just went down the wrong way. ♪ You're sitting there ♪ Snorting all your blow ♪ How far are you gonna go ♪ Just one thing I want you to know ♪ ♪ I'm gonna push you around 'til it don't ♪ ♪ You push me ♪ And push comes to town ♪ You push me ♪ You push me ♪ And push comes to town Hey, bitch. Hey. When did you get out? Yesterday. Surprised to see me? Not really. I heard only skanks hang out here. Why you- Whoa, easy, easy. Easy, homie. Didn't you just get outta jail for kicking some girl's ass? Yeah, I did. Anyways, standing here with your titties all out- Look, ladies, this is neither the time nor the place for this. You go backstage and get ready for your next number. Now. Bye. I'm sorry. I'm so lucky you're here. I don't know. You look like if you two were to get in a fight, you'd be able to take Sasha. You guys meet in jail? Yeah, we had a little bit of a rumble. Maybe I could help solve that little problem. Nah, I'm a lover, not a fighter. Maybe I'll make it worth your while. Very worth your while. You've got my attention. Good, but not here. Let's do it back in my office. Lead the way. Have a seat. Thank you. You see, Sasha, she's a hot head, you know. Dangerous. I could guess. And her temper can cause me a bit of trouble from time to time. But why don't you just fire her? It's just not that simple, you see. I have a bit of a side business, one here I do at the club after hours. Hold up. I've already been busted 36 times for prostitution. No, no, no, no. Let me stop you there. That's not what I'm talking about. That's good to know. What I'm talking about, it's a fight club. You understand? I think so. Okay, so you're promoting a slightly illegal fight here in the club and you and your bar buddies bet on the outcome? You are understanding me. But why me? Well, you see, Sasha is becoming a little more trouble than she's worth. And then there's you. You have the body, the fighting spirit the men like, and I know I can make you my number one girl. That's if you wanna play ball. Where do I sign? First things first. I'm gonna have to look over the details of our little arrangement. Everything work out okay? No, the usual. Guys promise you the moon and the stars just 'cause they wanna get in your pants. And? Well, mission accomplished. You wanted somebody on the inside and so did he. Excellent. Tell me all about it. Okay, you were right about the fight club. It happens right inside the club after the club closes. So that's why we've never been able to catch 'em red-handed. Yeah, there's a ring right in the middle of the spot. It goes nuts in there. Brilliant. And the thing is, they've got girls. Foxy boxers. Guys place bets on who's gonna win. Great news. So where does Sasha fit into all this? Well, right now she's the current champion. But that's all about to change. You, you? That's the hype. They're tired of her. She's such a loose cannon. She's on her way out. Only she doesn't know it yet? That's right. This is very interesting. Maybe if I can get to her, we can bring her over to our side. She'd be the perfect witness if she thought they're about to throw her under the bus. You could charm her. Hey, it worked on me. Thanks. Maybe I will. Right now I gotta file my report. Don't let me stop you. Keep up the good work. Thanks. Hello? Anybody here? Delivery. Hm. A very trusting lot. What do you want? I heard the noise. Thought I'd check it out. No one's supposed to be here right now. We're closed. Well, guess you should lock the front door. My mistake. So you can go now. I can't do that right now, Sasha. You know my name. You a parole officer? Not at all. But I'm here to help you. I don't need your help. Oh, but you do. You're on your way out, Sasha. I don't know what you're talking about. I think you do. You're being phased out, pushed aside for the new girl to take your place. That's crazy. Is it? That girl last night. Now you're getting wise. She's your next opponent and she's gonna win and you're gonna find yourself on the street. Or worse. Or worse? I wouldn't put it past them if they make this your last bout. You know too much. You have a reputation of being a hothead. Do you think they're gonna take that chance? Those bastards. But what can I do? I'll help you. Together we can turn the tables on them. But I need to know that you're really on my side, that I have your full trust. Let me see how I can convince you. That'll work. I'm starting to get the hang of this. I always knew you had the heart of a lion. Let's just hope I don't start to like it too much. Save it for the ring, Slugger. Now, are you sure we can trust Sasha to play along? I've gotten whatever assurances I can get. We'll just have to see. But what if she screws up? These guys look pretty dangerous. I don't wanna wind up at the wrong end of a gun. Me either, but like I said, I've got your back. That's all well and good for you, but this chick's got a temper and she's already threatened to kill me. What if this is a setup? If you're worried, why don't you meet up with her, make sure you guys are on the same page? I think I'll do that. Do you have her number? Yeah. Perfume. My, my. Give her a call. Maybe you guys can put your heads together, come up with a plan that'll make everybody happy. I think I'll do just that. Please come in. Thanks for seeing me. What choice did I have? We're supposed to fight tonight. It's probably a good idea to find out where we stand. Exactly. Drink? Why not? I probably should have known something like this would happen. I mean, you're only as good as your last fight. Nice place. It's not exactly what I expected. I keep all my money in the bank where it'll be safe. Smart move. Especially when you're dealing with scumbags. So how do we spin this? What do we do? Jake told me to take a dive in the second round or he'd kill me. Do you think he's serious? Of course he is. Money is everything to Jake. People mean nothing to him. So you lay down? But what if I don't go down? They'll try to kill me and you guys can catch them red-handed. Yeah, but what if Roger screws up? Why risk your neck? We can still get him on the gambling charges. Maybe you're right. My neck has been killing me anyway. You hurt it? I think so. Working out. How does that feel? Oh, you have magic fingers. That's for sure. That's what all the boys say. Oh yeah? What do the girls say? Let's find out. All right, let's get this straight. You're just gonna spar with her. Don't land anything heavy. And the most important thing is protect yourself. Trust me, I'm scared to death. If she's on our side, she'll go down that second round and we'll bust Jake when she's counted out. What if she doesn't take the dive? You're gonna use this. A horseshoe? You've gotta be kidding me. Nope. It's worked before. Yeah, for the three stooges. Just put it on. That's our cue. Good luck. Yeah right. She certainly knows how to put on a show. Yeah, let's just hope that conversation we had earlier seals the deal. It go well? Let's just say she went down in a second. Come on, protect yourself. Hey, ow! Gotta make it look good or we're both dead. Okay! Back her out. Right, right! You gotta start throwing some real punches. Really? Yeah, you gotta make it look like you're trying to knock me out. Okay, I'll try. Hey, look, they got him! Oh Sasha, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to knock you out with a horseshoe. Hey, maybe she needs some mouth to mouth. What happened? Jake just got arrested by Roger and I knocked you out with a horseshoe. What are you doing now? Giving you mouth to mouth. Don't stop. That's what it's about! Okay, I've already been in one riot, forced lesbian sex, offered a deal to become a narc for the feds, and that was just since this morning. You've gotta be kidding. A lifetime in prison? How long is that? For a second there, I thought we were gonna have rough jailhouse sex. I get paid to make war, not love. I probably should have known something like this would happen. I mean, you're only as good as your last fight. I'll fix you for this. You can use this. Let me see how I can convince you. That'll work. Will this do? Jake. I own the bar. It's just not that simple, you see. I have a bit of a side business, one here I do at the club after hours. You're angry. You're seething. You'd like nothing more than to walk over here and kill me. I'm still thinking about what a sweet ass you have. Down payment? I like the sound of that. You're a pretty one. They'll like you here. What a pity. But you'll always have me. Think of it. Hard time. Your youth flittering away, your pretty face lined with wrinkles, your head full of gray hair, and no Brazilian waxing. So what'll it be Cindy? Nicole or Bernie?
