You don't even know him. At least meet him once. Who, Vijay? A simple pilot? You don't know a thing about his family or his parents. What can he give you? All that that can make your daughter happy for the rest of her life. You are not in the right frame of mind l fulfilled all your wishes. l dreamt big dreams for you. And now you are destroying all my dreams. l will not let this happen. You will get married to Amar only. You will marry Amar only. Hi Pooja, l... Statue. How dare you?

Why just one shot, take a couple more... three guesses, l mean Okay, lets give it a try. Yes. Vijayji, greetings. Greetings, my friend. How do you know me? l am Vijay Bannerjee. l am looking for Vijay Mukherjee. Sorry. Come on. -No no no..... Hi Vijay. What did you say? Nothing, big brother. Oh my God. Pooja, you have to admit at my guesswork that l recognized Amar. Yes sir. l salute to your third glance. Come, have a seat. Pooja always talks about you. Good or bad? Obviously Good. And you are much better than what l had heard about you. One vanilla milkshake for me. Chocolate milkshake for me and him She knows what l want. and l know What he wants. Someone should ask me what l want. Big brother... -Yes... we have our brother over here and with a beautiful girl But who is the third person with this girl? Must be someone.

The driver parked it. Did you forget? Yes, l forgot. Oh oh! l forgot my lighter. You go on ahead, l will be right back. One of you was wishing that someone should ask you what you want. So here we go. What do you want, my friends? What have you come to give? -Hold this. Here's your cold milkshake Save him, save him, bring some water Vijay is always like this. He is always forgetting something or other Pooja, l really liked your choice. Really? l am very happy But why is Vijay not here yet? -He will. He's looking for his lighter. ls he looking for it or making it? Sorry, Sorry. lt was under the table. l found it after looking real hard. Oh God! l forgot my glasses. l will be back in two minutes. Looks like it's a day for forgetting things today. -l guess. What's up? You were anxious to celebrate Diwali? As a brother, l have brought these flowers to share. Then Give them. He will come, don't worry. l forgot my glasses at home. Crazy. What? When you are in, he's out. And vice versa. Sometimes you forget your lighter, and he his glasses Either you both stay in or stay out. Vijay, look at him. Amar, both have disappeared. Looks like there is something wrong inside. What have you done here? -l haven't done a thing. What are you doing here? l was looking for both of you. Where were you two? lt doesn't matter now that you found us. God know what you do. You are Kailasnath's lions. And Amar turned you into cotton in no time. He was not alone. There was another guy with him. Where did this other person come from? Don't know, dad. But he was even better than Amar. l am trying to eliminate my enemies and they keep on growing in numbers Who is this new enemy? How do l look? this blue hat will go with it. Fantastic l think this will go with it. Amar, this white hat does not go. The color does not match. What are you talking? See this. Amar, this is Rs. 2000, this is Rs.500 This is better. Look at this border... Excuse me. l like this one. Lets fight some more... We came out with bags instead of a hat... Why are you laughing? Sister, don't cut from there, cut from here. Like this. That's exactly how l want them. She should look like Miss World. He's absolutely right, but you should cut the hair at the back of her head like this. Amar, Are you crazy, talking stupid things. This is how the hair..... -Cut this hair like this..... Shut up! Quiet! you may Cut her hair your way. l was waiting for you only. How are you? Okay. Come. Lets play a game or two. uncle, today l have come to ask you for something. What is it that you needed to ask me for? All that is mine is yours. l have a priceless treasure with me, even that will be yours one day. l am waiting for the day when Pooja will go to your house as your bride. That will be the happiest day of my life. uncle, even l want happiness. Not for me, but for Pooja. That's what we are giving her, my son No, uncle. Pooja's happiness lies with someone else, not me. And l don't want to grab that from Pooja. Amar... Yes uncle. Pooja loves Vijay, not me -She is very naive. lt's a mistake that she is making. Vijay does not love her. He is just using her as a ladder to get to my wealth. l know it well. No, uncle. Vijay is not that kind of guy. l have met him. You met him? l've met him, l've judged him. And he is really a right man for Pooja. And as far as his financial situation goes, we can get rid of that problem. This cannot be possible, not at all... -Please! Listen to me. l always want to see Pooja smiling, not with tears in her eyes. Only Vijay can give her all the laughter in the world, not me. But, son.... uncle, Please. You have called me a son, then listen to your son. Okay. My happiness is in your happiness. Vijay sahib, do come in. You... Where is your sir? He is not home yet. He calls me over and disappears himself. lf he called you, then he will come definitely. Please have a seat, l will bring you a nice hot cup of tea. No, l will drink it with your sir. As you wish. Tell me, your sir lives all alone in this big house. No, l also live with him. Married or not? Even l wish That l should have a beautiful wife, who will cook hot food for me, sing a lullaby for me.... l am not talking about your marriage, l am talking about your sir. He used to love a lot, he was also supposed to get married.. To whom? Laxmi, Who Are you talking about? l was talking about me. You have a seat, l will bring tea. Hi. Hi Vijay. Sorry, l was a little late. The traffic is as slow as the speed in the pace of life. A lot of times you have to change roads to get home. Lets go in the bar Amar, do you think of me as a friend? Any doubt? Yes, l doubt a lot. lf you thought of me like that, then you would not hide anything from me. Hide what? just That you were in love with some one, were supposed to get married... What happened? Did she cheat you? No, not her. The circumstances cheated us. Who was she? Won't you tell me her name? No, my friend. Now that she belongs to someone else, l can't reveal it. Anyway, forget this. l had almost forgotten why l called you. Here you go. What is this? Read it and sign it. From today you are the director of Rajpal Aviation's. And also a chief engineer as well. What? Amar, such a big obligation.... now you Are forgetting, Vijay. you call me a friend on one side and talk about gratitude on the other. But Amar..... -There is no gratitude among friends. Congrats. My god. You look beautiful. l can't believe that l am handing you over to someone else. Maybe l will have to change my plans. l was just joking. Auntie, what are you doing here? Why don't you come inside? No, l am okay here. Today, l am announcing Pooja's engagement with Vijay Khanna. On this occasion l ask for you to bless this couple. What's the matter? You look very upset. Yes, l wanted to send some important documents to Cochin and pilots have striked today. lt will be a loss of thousands. l will carry them for you, if you don't mind. l had almost forgotten that you are a pilot. Are you free? Don't worry. lts only a half hour flight. l will be back in an hour. Here is the file. When do l have to take it? Right now. Which one, the blue one? Yes, your work is done. l am losing altitude. Bring the plane in control. Doctor, l don't understand what is the matter? As your family doctor, l should not hide anything from you. Your daughter is pregnant. Pooja, my child, you made such a big mistake in your youth. This will only lead to destruction for you and us. Parvati, our daughter is very under- standing. She will not do anything that will damage us and make me ashamed to even face myself in the mirror. Pooja, you will have to abort this baby. Dad, no. Life has stolen my love from me. Now please don't tell me to lose his last memory also. Please dad. You stupid girl. The baby that you call the memory of your love is going to be called a bastard by this world. And Dayashankar will not allow this. (Recites poetry) This formula also backfired. Come on Pooja, lets go for a drive. -l don't want to go. Why not? Leave me alone. Leave you alone? No way. l am your friend. l can feel your pain. l also know that one can tolerate their own pain. But if it affects others, then it is easier to share it with others. Amar, some heartaches cannot be shared with others. My parents want me to give up Vijay's last gift of love. Gift of love? Yes. l am pregnant with his child. Now you tell me, who will share this with me? l will share it with you. l will give me name to this child. l will marry you. She is waiting for you. Bye. Pooja, we might be husband and wife in the eyes of the world. But l will not do anything that will break your heart. Dayashankar has played such a sixer by marrying his daughter with my nephew. The ball is completely out of the field for us now. Daddy, l can't even see the ball. lf l saw the ball, then l will run him out. l mean, kill him. Then there will not be any hindrance for us. You be quiet. Amar will not just die. he will leave a child in his wake and then the inheritance will go to the child. What should we do? Sometimes l feel that you are not my children. lf l had to kill Dayashankar, l would have killed him before. He is very cunning and we will have to think twice before every step. Here you go. No No No. Look, you have to eat. Remember, you've someone else eating with you. See you. one minute. Be careful. Slowly. Sir, you have a phone call. tell them That l am busy. Sir, its urgent. lts from your home. Sir, you have become the child of a cute little father. l mean you have become the father of a cute little baby. Hi. How are you? l am fine. That's great. Where is the child. over there. He looks just like you. lf my child doesn't look like me, then who will he look like? Right? Sshh! Pooja! l am coming. What did l know? did you get your father wet? Come on the horse. Come on. Mom, l will become a pilot. you will Not become a pilot, okay? Laxmi, put this in my briefcase. Where is the briefcase? Downstairs. Daddy, mom will not let me become a pilot. Why not? You can become whatever you want. lf you want to become a pilot, then that's what you will be. uncle, where is Auntie Lucy who used to stay here? The poor woman passed away. When her son Vijay was killed in an plane accident, she couldn't absorb the shock and died. Drink your milk. -Hold on mama.... You can do this later. Drink your milk first. You drink half....come on, drink. You have become so thin. Now l know why you never answered my letters. You brought up an orphan like me with so much love and now you have left me alone. Very nice. Do you want to meet anyone? Pooja used to live here. My sir's daughter. She got married and moved away. Even she did not wait for me. Mama also left me alone. Who are you? Your death. Are you Vijay? Tell me, who tried to kill me. Tell me, who tried to kill me. Say it. This is the same car that was involved in the Mishra accident. Don't trouble your teacher, learn carefully. Send the car on time for lunch, it was late yesterday. Bye Rahul. Remember to bring his history book today. Bye. She couldn't wait for even a little while. Hello, who is this idiot on the line? Pooja, l am Amar. Why are you so upset? You...oh nothing... l called to tell you that l have a meeting tonight. l will be late. Try to come early. l will, But lt will be atleast midnight. Midnight? Yes, you eat your dinner and sleep. Okay. Bye. Midnight! Toady my love has broken all barriers and made you mine. After seeing you after so long, l felt like l got my life. You said so easily that you love some one else. Wish l could tell you how much l love you. How can l live without you? That means that l was the barrier. By breaking that, you stole Pooja from me. Amar, l realized today, that your friendship was all fake. You tried to kill me but l have come as your death today. l will make your life hell. Fire! Fire! Laxmi uncle, there is a fire Hurry up. Bring water, quick! What? the cottage is on fire. Please hurry. Okay, l will be right there. You said so easily that you like Vijay. Wish l could tell you how much l love you. From childhood till today. Pooja how can l live without you. After seeing Pooja after a long time today, it felt like l got my life. l can hardly wait for the day when you will come to my house as my bride. But when l found out, l think l lost you You loved me so much without letting me know. You always tried to look out for my happiness and l gave you grief. Your love is great and you are a great person. l bow to you and your love. Amar, what happened? Nothing. No my son, it's a lot. The murderer had your name on this bullet. Kailasnath! Kailasnath! Why am l scared, this is my house. Even a dog acts like a lion in his area Dayashankar, why are you screaming like that in a decent man's house? l am not deaf. You may not be deaf but you are definitely dumb. You have always acted slyly. You killed Rajpal and now you tried to kill Amar? Amar? l cannot do such an evil thing to my nephew. No, no. Only you can do such a thing. Do you remember what l had said at Rajpal's funeral? Even the shadow of your misdeeds will not touch our Amar. Your Amar? Since when did he become your Amar? You should be grateful to me that you are still alive, only because we have no enmity. You were Rajpal's enemy. l killed my brother, not a stranger. lt is a family matter. After his death, l should have received the inheritance. But due to you, l lost it. You started running everything only because you were his friend. You were his enemy, not his brother. And l was his friend as well as his brother. l had promised him that nobody will steal Amar's inheritance. Sometimes you have to sacrifice your life to keep your promise. Are you threatening me? No, l am giving you advice. Your best interests are in you packing your bag and leaving this place. Let Lord Shankar help you. lf you stay here, you will die. Because in our family, there will be always be a lot of bloodshed. Kailasnath, you missed your aim. But now l have written your name on this bullet. The next time this bullet leaves my gun, l will not miss my aim. Daddy, why was Dayashankar barking at us? Now you come, you idiots. l love and feed you more than my dogs and yet you can't even bark, if not bite. Tell me, did you fire at Amar? No. Did you? No. That's amazing. lf none of us fired at him, then who was it? The sky fell down and there was a disaster. Dayashankar's factory has been destroyed. l had not even hissed venomously at him and this happened. What l could not do in twenty years, this person has done it in twenty minutes. Looks like Dayashankar has got a new enemy. New enemy? What do you mean? You idiot. We are already his enemies right? But we haven't done this. l feel like kissing whoever did this job. Mr. Commissioner, we are incurring a lot of destruction. And you people are just trying. l don't want tryouts, l want you to catch the criminal. Don't worry at all. Wherever he is, he will be caught soon. Hello, who is speaking? your destruction. Don't be stupid, who are you? l fired at you, you didn't know it. Your factory was burnt down, you didn't know. Don't be silly, Amar. Very soon you will find out my identity. Whose phone was it, son? the same man Who destroyed us. Now catch it. Mommy, look what l found. What did you find? Let me see. Lighter. This is Vijay's lighter. My lighter had gone under the table hence l had to look for it. Mama, l have written so many letters to Pooja and you, but you two never wrote back. When l was going to Cochin, my plane caught fire suddenly l was saved by God's grace. The fishermen saved my life. l was unconscious for many years. When l regained consciousness, l tried to get in touch with you. But unfortunately, l was unable to walk and hence l felt ashamed. Their leader took good care of me and now l am able to walk. l am coming. l want to get even with the person who did this to me. Yours Vijay NOOOO! You all cheated me. You all lied to me. Pooja, what are you doing? Get out of my sight! What happened Pooja? Why are you crying? Don't touch me! You have blood on your hands. You are a murderer! What? Are you in your senses? l wasn't before, but now l am. Vijay did not die, he was killed. By none other than you. Here, read this. You sent Vijay away on an excuse so you could kill him. You sabotaged his plane and put him out of your way. Why? Why did you do it? l had thought of you as my friend. You showed me sympathy and gave me so much grief. Why? just to win me? No. You are misjudging me. lf Vijay is alive, then it is a happy news for all lt is good news only for me. You must be very sad with it. Where is Vijay, Pooja? l want to meet him. Who do you want to meet? The one who is after your blood? l am not afraid of death. l am sad because both of you misjudged me. You still haven't got rid of your mask. You played with our lives and yet you are..... l cannot stay with a selfish man like you. l feel suffocated. l am leaving and l will not be coming back to this house again. A daughter comes to in-laws house after marriage and only leaves it when she dies. You are right, father. Please kill me so that l don't have to live with a murderer. Please kill me. Who are you talking about? The same man who is standing as my husband in front of me. Who has he killed? my love. You mean Vijay? Vijay is alive, daddy. Vijay can escape death once, not again and again. -Daddy! Amar is not Vijay's killer. Then who is it? Tell me so that l can kill him. He has destroyed his life. Then kill me. Daddy, you? Yes. l am Vijay's killer. Why? You knew that Pooja never loved me. l can't believe that you played with Vijay's life like that. uncle, l had told you that l can't bear to see tears in Pooja's eyes. lnspite of all that, you killed everybody's happiness for my sake. Why? You want to know? Then listen. Whatever l am today is due to Amar's father and my friend, Rajpal. l had promised Rajpal when he died that Amar's well-being and his happiness will be my life's aim. You started loving Vijay and Amar sacrificed his happiness for yours. But l couldn't let that happen. Hence, l sacrificed your happiness by planning to kill Vijay. And not just that, but l also hid all of Vijay's letters about his survival from you. Because Dayashankar would do anything to maintain the promise given to his friend. Pooja! Let me die, l want to die. Life has brought me at such an uneven crossroad today. On one side is my husband who has helped and comforted me. On the other side is love who is screaming for justice. You tell me what l should do. l don't know, Pooja. Life is always testing us and we never know when. All l know is that l have and will always be your friend. This is our test and we will pass it together. We will get out of this. You stay here and l will be back with your teddy. Come soon. l will. Give me a kiss. Mommy! Mommy! Rahul, my child! Rahul. Save my son! Take care of him. His father will come out to save him. Now will start the fight between the snake and the mongoose. Tell Kailasnath that if Amar does not show up, then kill the child. l want my son. l can't live without him Daddy, please find him for me. Have some faith, nothing will happen to Rahul. lf Rahul gets hurt.... Yes, l am Amar. Have you found out anything about Rahul? You will know about him. First listen to me. A few years ago, you had traded my life. You won't live long for that. Anyway, you will die when you realize that your son is in my hands. -Listen to me..... You listen to me. Your time to talk has expired and its time l spoke. lf you wish to save your child, then come to Madh island before twelve tomorrow. Or else l will send your son's pieces parceled to your house. And yes, you wanted to know who l am...your old friend Vijay. What's the matter Pooja? Are you surprised to see me alive? You think you are alive. But you can't be the Vijay that l was so devastated to lose. You just have his body, not his soul. His soul is not as evil as you You are right. l am evil, but why? Because you have lost your shame. You called yourself a living dead body at my death. Do you remember that a dead person is buried and not married? ln our society, people grieve on someone's death. They do not celebrate for a few days. But you went and got married. Aren't you not ashamed of yourself? Did you not have faith in me? Was that love fake? You are evil, not me. Your soul has no morals. Did you finish what you had to say? lf there is anything left, say that too. l want to see how much venom you have in you. What do you want to say? That l am lying? That it does not mean a thing? Yes, it does not mean a thing. And you say that because you are a man who sins, but the woman has to bear the consequences of that. l was the same depressed woman with a burden. Amar not only married me but also gave me a power to feel myself alive today. Wow, Pooja. You are a real lndian wife. You will do anything to maintain your husband's image, no matter how evil he is. Beware, Amar is.... How can he give life to anyone? He plays with others life for his own happiness. He tried to kill me to win you. l was lucky that l did not die. But not even God can save him. Are you crazy? Yes, l am Crazy. l am Crazy. l am burning in my own misery. lts your Amar's fault. He tried to kill me. Vijay became Devaa due to your Amar. l will kill him and his son. You cannot do that! -l will do exactly that! Okay, then go and kill the memory of our love. What do you mean? l am telling the truth. Rahul is your son. Your own blood. Pooja, you are lying? No. And the person that you are calling your murderer, he does not even know who planned this. Yes. Even l doubted him at first until l realized that he is innocent. Had Amar not been there then, l would have either committed suicide or l would have ended up in some bad part of town with a bad reputation. Amar did not just give me a life, he gave your son his name and a right to respectability in society. And here you are, trying to kill such a nice man What have l done? l thought that my savior was my murderer. Pooja, who had planned my death? My daddy. But why? Amar had somehow convinced him about our wedding, but he couldn't forget his old promise to his friend. Enough Pooja. After hearing all this, l have started hating myself. There is not much time. l will have to go there before sunrise. Vijay, listen to me. Vijay! Vijay, l have come. Vijay. Nephew, l have also come here. Where is Vijay? Where is my son, Kailasnath? You will get him. You forgot your relations in caring for your son. After all, l am your uncle. Evil people like you can never be anyone's uncles. You are stubborn and stupid just like your father. l wanted to be near him, but he went near God. He wouldn't come close to me at all. l don't want to hear your garbage. just give me my child. Daddy! Daddy! -Rahul! Kailasnath, if anything happens to my son, l will not let you live. You like to trouble kids right? Now see how l take you for a spin. Come here my child. l want to go to My daddy. l am your daddy. l want My daddy. l am your daddy. Not you, l want My daddy. l will take you to your Daddy. Rahul, my son. Are you all right? Yes daddy. Kailasnath! Pooja, l can't bear to see tears in your eyes. l always want to see you happy. Nothing will happen to you, my son. Amar, let me take you to the hospital Vijay, l am returning your love to you. Forgive me Amar. l am really ashamed of myself. lt's not your fault, Vijay. lt's fate. You got your Vijay. Today my wish is fulfilled. Are you going to send off your childhood friend in tears? No Amar, l will not let you go. Statue! You are my childhood friend. l am going to need you at every step of my life. Amar, you cannot leave me in between. Released. Released Amar. Amar, l only loved Pooja. But you have also worshipped Pooja in such a way that even the angels will bow before you. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
