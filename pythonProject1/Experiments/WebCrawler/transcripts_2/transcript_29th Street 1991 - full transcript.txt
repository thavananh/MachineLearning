At any rate, congratulations to Frank pesce Of queens, new york, wherever you are. Turn it off, will you? New yorkers are crying over more bad economic news today. Some say our city is going down-- That's you? Same guy? Yeah. And then you went and broke windows in the church? What are you, some kind of mammalucco? Yeah, well, it's a long story, you know? You're not going anywhere. Neither am i. Not until you make some kind of sense out of this. I swear to god, The only way I know how to tell this story Is from the beginning. I got all night. You see, I got this, uh... I got this curse. I've been lucky since the day I was born. It's like my mother. She used to work at lincoln hospital, So that's where I was supposed to be born. But she went into labor at a bingo parlor A couple of blocks from where we live, So they had to rush her TO BELLEVUE HOSPITAL ON 29th STREET INSTEAD. Actually, that was my first stroke of luck, Because on that very night Lincoln hospital ended up having a huge fire, And the place nearly burned to the ground. 1-7. Vito, where you-- 1-7. Hold it. 603 is the combination. 60 cents. 10 cents a weigh. No, the others are straight action, shadow. Straight action. Madeline, hey, huh, huh? 717 for $1.20. Mr. Pesce? Shadow, i'll get right back to you. Would you like to see your son? Come on, madeline. Let's go see your brother. Come on, come on. Let's go. My mom said he always cried When he saw us for the first time-- My brother, my sister, me. Come on! We're going to be late. I'm coming! 20 minutes from here to radio city. I got you a hot dog. You don't want nothing? I'm not hungry. Come on, let's walk. It's such a beautiful day. All right, let's go. Come on, we got about 8 blocks, right? Yeah, but we're going to see Student prince. Come on. When I was younger, my dad used to always seem Like this giant to me, This guy who knew everything about everything. What are you looking at? That. What's that? What's that say? Oh, that says, "Today is president eisenhower's birthday." I want to get my name up there. I wouldn't want to have it any other way, Frankie, But only great people get their names up there. How can I get my name up there? You know, you got to do something big, Frankie. Big. How big? Very, very big, you got to do. How big? Well, uh... This big. I guess every son Wants to make his father proud of him, You know, so he doesn't feel like a jerk for having you. And I figured if I could get my name up on that building, At least I could have left Some kind of mark on the world. Frank, Sr.: MAYBE YOU'LL SING LIKE MARIO LANZA. You ever hear of him? Frank: IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, There were, like, 2 ways to make it. One's the right way, And the other way's the fast way. And I got to tell you, The fast way looked pretty attractive to me As a kid. Wow, look at that. ♪ you went away and left me a long time ago ♪ That's louie tucci. He's the biggest wise guy in the neighborhood. He's poison. Don't even look at him. Yeah, but I still like his car. ♪ but you can't come in ♪ You'd be better off walking, Frankie. Come on. ♪ I hear you knockin'... ♪ My dad could always talk circles around everybody. I swear, the guy should've run for office And been a politician. There was this odd thing goin' on Between him and louie tucci. I knew my father couldn't stand him, Yet they seemed to be spending a lot of time together, Especially when my dad lost his trucking company, Which i'll get to later. Hi, Frankie. Dad, you say don't look at the guy Because he's no good, Then you hang around with him. You mean tucci? Yeah. Come on, Frankie. It's business. You in business with that guy? Never. You see, Frankie, I don't want to be in business with him. I don't want to spend any time With a guy like that. That's why you were with him? Yeah. Because you don't want to be? That's right. You mean, you spend time with him Because you don't want to spend time with him? That's exactly right. If I spent less time with him, I'd have to spend even more time with him. So if you spent no time with him... Then i'd be with him constantly. I can't wait until I grow up, pop, So I can know what the hell you're talking about. Get out of here, wise guy. Frankie! Don't be late. Mama's cooking ciccia baste. Yeah, dad. Growing up didn't help. I still don't know What the hell he's talking about. Now, this luck thing Kept on happening time after time. Like I remember one time I was hanging out with my friend jimmy vitello, Whose father was also in the mob. In fact, he was the biggest mobster in the tri-state area. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Wow! Can you believe it? It was just laying here. Hey, let's take it down to irv's and pawn it. I'll give you $5.00. $5.00? Are you nuts? Thing must be worth A couple of hundred bucks. Yeah, don't be a fucking stiff. Ooh, what a mouth you got. You kiss your mother with that mouth? Where did you get this? Huh? God left it for us. Oh, well, I don't want him coming around here Looking for it. Get it out of here. Huh? Irv, you know who my father is. We don't want to have a little misunderstanding, Now, do we? Jeez, all right. All right. You're something else, you know that? Here. 10 bucks. That's it. Now get out of here, little bastards. Go ahead. Now, to a kid, this seemed very impressive. All you had to do Was mention jimmy vitello's father, And, boom, you got whatever the hell you wanted. So no matter how far out of line jimmy got, The cops never showed up at his house. However, a member of new york's finest Did end up in our house. My brother vito decided to become a cop. Personally,i think it was like Getting a wolf to watch the chickens. Pesce, vito. But at least somebody was doing something For the family name. Vallamone, ronald. Meanwhile I hung around with a bunch of guys Who were doing absolutely nothing with their lives. There was lenny nipton. You know, we called him needle nose. This guy was the definition Of postnasal drip. Hey, Frank. You know something, Frank? Girls love poetry. Dig this. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow Creeps, baby, in its petty pace. Then there was dom the bomb. ♪ hello, Frankie, how are you today ♪ ♪ yeah, yeah, yeah, now ♪ This guy actually thought he could sing. What are you going to do? I got to lose some weight. I think I got a gland problem. Rocky sav had a gland problem Ever since the day he was born. Poor sal las benas. He spit on everything in sight whenever he talked. And then there was jimmy vitello. Frankie boy, how you doing? Want to make some money? $10,000 cash, tax-free. Frank, we had some pizza the other night... ♪ and if you promise not to run away ♪ Extra cheese, sausage, pepperoni... ♪ 'cause i'm your... ♪ What cops? ...of recorded time. ♪ in town ♪ Forget about it. While I was hanging around in the street Bullshitting with my friends all day long, My dad was out breaking his ass. Ever since he lost his own company, He had been working as a driver for some other outfit. So every day he had to take the subway to penn station, Then he would catch a connecting train All the way to union city To drive a truck 5 days a week Through city traffic. The yankees are going to win. Get it out of here. Yankees, big. All right? Yo, Frankie! No wonder the guy had problems relaxing. This city is going to the friggin' dogs. We got to get out of here. Yeah, yeah, I seen that. We need a house out of manhattan, A nice house with our own lawn. That's what we need. You know, pop, it's funny that you're saying that, Because of what I been thinking. I can't wait to hear this. The way I got it figured, right, Is that the future is in outer space. Maybe I could become an astronaut. It's the last frontier, pop. An astronaut? Well, think about it. Look, pop, I could become The first italian on the moon. No, don't laugh. I want to-- I want to do things that I never done before. Oh, I see. Why don't you try going inside And cleaning up your fucking room? Come on, pop. I'm serious. I got longings and desires, like everybody. Are you all right? Is there little people Going around in your head, or what? Are you putting me on? No. See, because i'm talking About reality here, Frankie. Reality. You get it? I'm trying to move us to queens, And you're talking about Picking up fucking moon rocks. Well, you know what your problem is, pop? Yeah, what's my problem? Your dreams are too small. Yeah. My dreams are too small. Dean Martin: ♪ VOLARE... ♪ Frank: ANYWAY, WHEN I WAS 18, My father got his dream and moved us all to queens. He got his other dream, too--his own lawn. Every afternoon, like clockwork, He'd come home and set up the sprinkler. ♪ no wonder my happy heart sings ♪ ♪ your love has given me wings ♪ ♪ nel blu de pinto de blu ♪ So, what are we eating tonight? Shithead ordered a couple of pizzas. Could you watch your language, please? Where the hell did he go, yonkers? When did you stop liking pizza? It's a waste of money. But gambling is not a waste of money, huh? Who's gambling? See me gambling? I heard you took your son Frankie to the track yesterday. You couldn't buy him A miserable hot dog for a buck, But i'll bet you spent $400 on a horse That came in dead last. Go ahead. Tell me i'm wrong. Huh? Do you see my name on these? You see my name anywhere on these stubs, huh? Oh, i'm so sorry. That must've been some other guy Wearing your pants. HOW MUCH DiALBIA'S COST? 7 bucks. 7 bucks, huh? You know it probably cost 25 cents to make. So? So? So? I'm a man of principle. And I ain't paying 27 times what it's worth! That's so! Not for nothing, pop. Did you pay for this? You making a joke, Frankie? My family could start a fight Over absolutely anything. What's the weather for tomorrow? I heard it's going to rain. That ain't what I heard. What the hell did you hear? Never mind, Frankie. Where did you hear rain? Madeline, I heard it on the radio. The weatherman said it's going to rain tomorrow. Typical, vito. You listen to the radio. They're always wrong. Hold it. Do me a favor with the goddamn weather here. With the weather, with the rain, with mars. Who gives a shit? Who gives a shit about sun and rain? I do, pop. You don't pay $10 to get your hair done. My hair frizzes in the rain. Vito: LISTEN, WITCH, LEAVE YOUR BROOM AT HOME. Don't go out. Your hair won't get wet. That was good one, wasn't it? Know what, vito? I got a 2-seater, So you can just jump right on with me. Fucking shit! Who's going to marry you with a mouth like that? 2 months later, she married a sicilian guy Named tony. And tony didn't make too big of a hit with the family. Now, the vietnam war was raging full force. Guys from the neighborhood Were coming home in boxes every week. We all got letters in the mail And had to go to the draft board to sign up, So we were about to do what was right for our country. You know, I just developed A theory on life. Oh, yeah? What's that? Ok, listen, because it's very complicated. First you're born, And you're like a baby, a child. And then you start to mature a little After you hit your "adio-lescence." Then you grow old. And then you grow older. And then you die. And that's it. Rocky sav, no offense, But that's the stupidest fucking thing I ever heard. Rocky: ALL RIGHT, LAUGH, But if you stop and think about it, It makes a lot of sense. Nearly a thousand 18-year-olds From every part of the city were there. Getting a load of these guys, I figured we could win the vietnam war In about 15 minutes. Quiet down! Quiet down in here! Hey, rocky, whoa! When you going to grow up? Quiet down, you shitheads! Street trash motherfuckers! Marrone. This guy looks tough. Yeah, he looks real tough, Don't he, Frank? Yeah. Sergeant: ALL RIGHT! As of this minute, All of you here Is now the property Of the united states government! Now, if anybody here Has been in jail... Who is out on bail... Please move to the right side of the auditorium! The whole fucking room got up. You got to be shitting me. Excuse me, sir? Excuse me? I really don't think it's fair That we got to take a test that we didn't study for. It's a goddamn urine examination, boy! I'm sorry. I misunderstood. I thought it was something else. What's your name, boy? Pesce. Frank pesce, sir. You know, pesce means fish in italian. I don't give a good god damn what it means! I'm sorry, sir. Is there something wrong with you, boy? No, n-n-not that i'm aware of, sir. You got a high school diploma? No, sir.

You get the hell up there and see the psychiatrist. Move it, boy! Get the hell up there! You got 4 cards in your hand-- I don't know what I should do. It's too early in the game. You don't want to build it up the back, Then you wind up in trouble. You going to tell me? Here comes general custer. Jesus. Come here, Frank. I want to talk to you. 10 million guys are tryin' to beat the draft, And only you can get away with it. What do you mean? You see this letter? Know what it says? It says the united states government Thinks that you are a calculated risk. Is that good or bad? It means that they think you are nuts. So now the army knows What the whole neighborhood knows. You're fucking crazy. I'm very sorry i'm letting you guys down By not stepping on a land mine. What's so funny? I'm supposed to go to all my friends in the neighborhood And say that my son's nutjob-- That's why he's not in the army? Huh? You got to have mental illness, right? And i'll tell you something else-- You're ruined! You're ruined! You'll never get a city job! Never! Oh, excuse me. I'll just get a rope. I'll hang myself. Mentally disqualified. This reflects on the whole family. Frank: SO I GOT OUT OF THE WAR, But I knew it was no accident. It was my lucky star. All right, wait a minute. I'm trying to figure out what I got here.

I'm going to back to bed. That's the worst pizza I've ever had in my life. The only member of our family To appreciate my father's pizza Was vinnie. Obviously, my father's not the kind of guy To sit around the house like a normal person. The boredom was driving him crazy. And remember, the idle mind Is the devil's playground, And in my father's case, It was about to become an amusement park. Hey. Where the hell are you three going, huh? We're going bowling. That's right. Bowling. Bowling, huh? You haven't been bowling since christ left chicago. Well, maybe we'll go bowling And maybe we won't go bowling. Maybe we'll do something else. But I figured it would be nice For a father to spend the evening With his sons. Got a problem with that? You are so full of shit. Ah, faccia due... I don't know. With dad out of work, Our money situation was getting worse and worse. The three of us decided to get rid of the t-bird For the insurance money. Frankie, Frankie. What? Wait a minute. Stand over there. What are you talkin' about? Stand over there. Turn around. Come on. Turn around. Let's go home. They found the car completely untouched, Except for the damage my father had done, Just where we left it in the bronx. See, there are times When you don't want to be lucky, But that lucky star keeps on shining no matter what. Bowling, huh? ♪ the best things in life are free ♪ ♪ but you can give them to the birds and bees ♪ To make matters worse, We had a $500 deductible on the car. A broken windshield cost 380 bucks And 40 for the tow. Now we had to pay 420 bucks To get the car back in the shape it was. We don't-- we don't-- We don't have $420! Well, insurance companies Are not in business to be taken By stupid idiots like you guys. Oh, yeah? Yeah? Idiots, huh? The car really did get stolen in the bowlin' alley. I don't want to get into it again. Yeah, like i'm 5'2" and blonde. The car didn't get stolen Because it's under his name. You know him with that lucky curse, They'll find it no matter where we hide it. This is all your fault. You know what? You're full of shit. I'm full of shit? Where you going now? I got something I got to do, all right? I paid my cousin leo a visit in budd lake, new jersey. Together we figured out a way to dump the car. Leo, you stinking crook, get over here. Leo! What's the matter with you? You know, this stuff really works. Forget that shit. Come here. Let me ask you something. ♪ money ♪ ♪ that's what I want ♪ ♪ lots of money ♪ Get in there! ♪ that's what I want ♪ 30 days later we were told to go to the insurance company To pick up the check. The month had come and gone and no one had found the car... As I was sure would be the case. Let's not look like 3 gaboons going in there. Who says we look like gaboons? We look like a family gonna pick up a check. Look like a pack of fucking wild dogs-- That's what we look like. I'm going in by myself. You wait out here. You don't want us to come in? Frankie, tell him what I said. I'm sorry, mr. Pesce, but it seems That nobody's found your son's car. Aw, that's too bad. You know, my son Frankie... He's been sick for the whole month. You know what he says to me? He says, "daddy, losing my car Is like losing my brother." I mean, the kid's heartbroken. Gee, you know, I feel terrible about this. Listen... Let me make one more phone call. Oh, no, no-- Maybe we'll get lucky. Yeah. Hi, this is lucy sills. I was wondering if there was anything New with case, uh... "102169." Thanks. They're checking. Yeah. What? Ivory gold mist? Uh, no, no. Aqua velva. Oh, no. The car. Is it ivory gold mist, A ford thunderbird, License plates "my way"? Yes. That's it. Thank you. Thank you. It seems they found your son's car Over the weekend in budd lake, new jersey. Isn't that wonderful? I'm so glad I checked. Budd lake, new jersey? Budd lake. ...bullshit me. Automatic, my ass. Budd lake, new jersey? Are you fucking crazy? What the hell are you talking about? They found the car In budd fucking lake, new jersey! What a coincidence. We got family there. I don't think the insurance company's Gonna put that together. Who'd you go with, Your cousin leo, that fucking moron? You, come! Drive the car! Drive the car! Shut the fuck up, all right? Get in the car! I'm getting in the car. I ended up selling the car to my cousin leo. 2 days after the sale, it got stolen. But that money didn't last long. Now we were hitting rock bottom. Frankie, give me the keys. Come on, car keys. Give me the keys. I got to go out. Gimme the keys. I need them. I'm going to the garden. Come on. Come on. Come. Come. Come. Come. Got any money? What?! You got some money? I need some money. Dad, not now. Frankie, look. I'm way behind here. What do you got? I've got $400. Go get it. No, dad. What for? Frankie, I got a feeling tonight-- I got a feeling That I can't lose on a fight tonight. Please. You're my partner. We'll be partners. Not again, dad. It's the first time I ask for money-- All right. I'm going to get the money. All right. Hurry up. Come on. Of course, I got him the money. Frankie, it's in the blue sock On the left side of the drawer. Believe it or not, My father actually won on a fight. So I went down to the club To stop him before he did any more damage. But philly said my father doubled his money, Took the 800 bucks, put it on a horse. He got it up to 1,100 And took off like a bat out of hell With johnny cake and joe numbers, Saying something about going to yonkers raceway. What are you doing? I'm waiting for you. Is your mother up? Yeah. She's up. Aw, christ. I'm getting out of here. Hey, what happened? I lost 400. Good. Good. I was really worried there. Listen, pop. Why don't you let me hold the rest of the money? There's no money, Frank. I thought you said you lost 400. Right. I lost the 400 bucks. You had 1,100 when you left the club. Yeah, I did. That means you've got 700 on you now. No. I don't have shit on me now. How can you lose 400 out of 1,100 And not have anything on you now? I lost the 400 bucks you gave me. You lost $1,100? No. I lost the 400 you gave me. Then where's the other 700? It's gone. You lost it all. No. Yeah. Technically. Technically? What "technically"? You had 1,100 and now you don't have shit! That means that you lost 1,100! I don't count the other 700. Oh, you don't count it. That money ain't real? It's no good? It doesn't pay the mortgage, the gas, the electric. Look, I don't count it because it's their money. You see, I gambled with their money. I lost your 400, But their money is their money. You had their money in your pocket, didn't you? Frankie... I'm out of fucking work! What the hell do you want from me? Besides, what the hell are you worried about? You're going to win the lottery And then hang out on the street And be a jerk-off for the rest of your life! How the hell do you know i'm going to win that lottery? Even if I do, it's not included in my plans I'm going to hang out on some street corner. I'm going to do something with my life. Yeah? Yeah, like what? I don't know, But i'm going to get a real life. And what am i? A fucking cartoon character? Oh, shit. F-Frank. Frank. I'm sorry what I did to youse. You listen to me, Frank pesce. Listen to me good, huh? I don't want to hear this shit. Just don't you die on me, you bastard. That's all. Not now. Ma, relax. You're not going nowhere. You're going to get well. You're going to come home. I want the house To stink of them rotten pizzas You've been making. I want you to see your son Frankie Just make something out of his life. Do you think I want to live till 106?

He said, "keep the cat off the lawn." Hey, pops. Be careful with him, Frank. You all right? He looks good, doesn't he? He said we ruined his lawn While he was gone. That's when I knew he was all right. He was back to terrorizing everybody. I went for the first available job I could find. And I got one Over at sheldon toys as a sales representative.

Yeah, yeah, I know all about that. Hurry up. I'm freezing my balls off. I want to exchange the ticket For what my father owes him. But he's got to promise me that he won't hurt him. All right. You wait here. You wait right here. All right. It sounds fair. You got the ticket on you? Yeah. I got it. Let's have it. Buon natale, kid. So that's that. I guess tucci's a very happy guy tonight Because he won 6.2 million bucks. But I saved my father. Hey, I had to do what I had to do, You know what I mean? Then I went down to the gordon, Check the results. Lucky me, huh? The rest you know. I went crazy down at the church. You guys picked me up and you brought me here. Do what you want with me. I just want to go home And make sure that my father's all right. Go on home, boy. Let's forget it ever happened. Tolan. Yes, sir? Give him a hand. Take him home. Anything else he needs. Thanks, guys. Frank... You're no mammalucco. Thanks, sarge. God bless, father lowery. Hey, Frank, want us to walk you up? No. I'll be all right. Hey, Frank... Merry christmas. Thank you. Hey, Frankie, congratulations. We heard about you on tv. This is my girlfriend sheila. She's been dying to meet you, Frankie. This is so great. Oh, god bless you, Frankie. Mom, listen to me. Mom, we got problems. I got to talk to dad. Where is he? He's in the kitchen. He's making a pizza. We're having a party. Everybody's here. Yay, Frankie! My hero is right here. Yay! yay! Yay! Ma, everybody's here. Get rid of them. Of course they're here. What's the matter with you? I knew you were gonna win! The man of the hour finally comes home! Congratulations, son. Yeah! All right! Excuse me. Oh! Excuse me. What the hell are you doin' here? I thought we straightened this out. I don't know What the fuck you're talking about. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me here. Can I say something here, louie? I want everybody to hear this. Tucci, I can't borrow money off you anymore. You want to know why? My son Frankie's a millionaire, And he's choosy who I borrow money from. There's something I got to tell you. Frank, you're not going to ruin my moment, are ya? I've been waiting my whole life for this. I'd like to say something. I said some bad things To my son Frankie earlier tonight, Things that i'm sorry I said. Me and my kid, we're big dreamers. But my problem is That most of my dreams didn't work out. And I think I stepped on a lot of Frankie's dreams. You know, you get a little older, You get harder and you get harder. Sometimes you forget what's important. But today... One of my dreams came true. I found out why my son Frankie was born. What is this, a fucking christening? Where's my money? Tucci... You know what's in here? Huh? $10,000. That's what I owe you. Vito, give it to tucci. Give it to him. Go on. No. You don't owe him anything. Merry christmas, pesce. Likewise, louie. What are you doing? I owe him money. Hey, hey! You can't take that! I owe it to him. He can't take that money! He can't take that money. He loaned me the money. I owed it to him. I paid him. Dad... I heard that you were in trouble. So I gave tucci the ticket. You gave tucci the ticket? I gave tucci the ticket. You gave him the ticket. I gave him the ticket. You didn't give him the ticket. Did you give him the ticket? Pop, for christ's sake, Don't do one of these in front of everybody. I gave the ticket away at the restaurant. I gave it to one of his goons. I got a call from philly the nap. He told me what happened at the club tonight. You're my son. I'm your father. So I figured out what you were going to do. The guy you gave the ticket to? Big friend of mine. Frankie... You gave the ticket... Back to yourself. What? We got it. We got it! You got the ticket? We got it! You got the ticket? Right here! You got the ticket. He's got the ticket. Where... Where'd you get the money? WHERE'D I GET THE MONEY, THE 10 Gs? JIMMY V... Am I good for the 10 g? You got it, mr. Pesce. This one you're going to love. Oh, no. I can't eat that. Come on. Get in there. Come on. Have a piece. No! No! Put her there. God bless you. Buon natale, kid. You bastard. What the hell did you say to those guys in the car? I wished them a merry christmas. Ha ha ha! Thank you. ♪ peace on earth and mercy mild ♪ ♪ god and sinners... ♪ Frankie. Hey, pop. This is yours. Frankie... Did you know the first time I saw you, You made me cry? What you did tonight was great. I want to thank you for it. It's just a good thing That you're smarter than me. Uh-uh. No, Frank, I ain't smarter than you. I'm just older. You know you said Some beautiful things in there tonight. But would you finish... Saying what you started saying in there? What? You know. About why I was born. I don't know. I don't know. Why don't you go out there And find out for yourself? From time to time, I think back on rocky sav's theory of life. You know--you're born, you grow old, and you die. Maybe that's all there is to it, And we just keep making it more complicated Than we need to. My father's gone now, But I remember how years later When we were up at the new house on glencove, Overlooking his new lawn of kentucky bluegrass About half the size of a football field, I said to him, "I guess there's a happy ending for us after all." "Happy ending," he said. "I wouldn't have it any other way."
