foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- (funky music) (funky music) (funky music) There's a certain beauty, peacefulness that exists at this time of the morning. City still sleeps, for most part... It's the dawn of a new day! Anything can happen. A new day. Clean slate. For me however, the silence, the chill in the air, is a big slap in the face. It's the world telling me I screwed up. You see, I'm not a morning person. I live in the afternoon and late a night. If I witness a dawn of a new day, something went wrong. There's an incredible history in this little neighborhood. Home of the Beat Generation, site of shore leave for the army services, you got Little Italy on one side, China town on the other. Some of the charms seem to be lost, though. More homeless, desperation... that's one side. On the other side there's Yappies everywhere, Starter Porsche Boxster Types. That's what my girlfriend calls them. Even The Condo, The Mackoff Strip Club, The Homo's Carol Dota, the pioneer of American stripping shut down. They converted it into a sports bar. Satellite dish, microbrews... the whole thing. So now, in the spot where two people having sex on the rising hydraulic piano were crushed to death against the roof seats a big screen TV. -Is my tie straight? -Yeah. -Cool. There goes Steve. We've been roommates for a year. That's not our apartment though. The place I came out of, that's not our place either. We live somewhere else. Not far, just half the street. I'll probably go there, later. I need coffee. -Hey, good morning sunshine! What are you doing up so early? -I'm on my way to bed. -Coffee gonna be a nightcap? -It's fucking early! -I don't think I've ever seen you up this early. -Have you gone to school. -Yeah. -What are you doin' up at this hour? -I'm goin' to bed. -So, you took off with that freaker last night. (laugh) -Michelle. -Yeah. Was she a freaker! -She's not a freaker she's a stripper. -She's a child. -She's 19-years-old. -She's a 19-years-old stripper on a vacation from New Orleans. -Sounds like a freaker. -Hello gentlemen. -Hey. -Bongiorno. -Hello Tyler. -Hello Sean. -Can I have some piping hot ? Dude you were sneaking out at the youth hostel last night. -You're talking to me? -No I'm talking to professor. Of course I'm talking to you. -That was fifteen minutes ago! -How was she? -How do you know this? -That's what Steve said. -How the fuck did he know? -He saw you this morning! -Oh, we barely spoke! -Oh, wow! So, you and Paige broke up? -No, we didn't break up! -You're fucked! (laughs) -Is it all right with you if I asked you out? -I just said we didn't wake up! -I'm going to get the paper! -I'm gonna ask 'er out. -Jesus, didn't you hear the man Joe? They're still a couple. -She's gonna be here at ten. When she gets here I'm gonna ask her if she knows. And if she knows, I'm gonna ask 'er out. -How come I don't get to ask her out? -Dude, that's Tyler's girlfriend! -Fuck! Every time... -Fuck you guys! (laugh) Tyler! Oh, Tyler! Oh please, you must join us! We are having mimosis. -Have you not been asleep yet? We've been having mimosis! -All night... -No, no, that would be gauche. Peeeewwwzh! (strange sound) Oh, and a... Paige is with us. I don't think she knows about Michelle. -How do you know? How does everybody know about Michelle? -It's North Beach, baby! -Good morning posers! -You're late. -For the love of God! Cut this man off! -Hey. -Hey. -Have a drink! What are you having? -It's seven. -Right! -Hey, Fiss, mimosis all around! It would be seven all at all! So, I was... I was a t the bar and I don't think you saw me. -Yes I did. -Yes you did. So, am... What did you do last night? -I should be asking you the same question. -What exactly do you now? -Don't worry about it. -What does that mean? -It means, don't worry about it. -That makes me worry about it. -Drink up! And for you beautiful. -Thank you. -So... -What did you do last night? -Jesus Tyler, fucking drop it! -What!? -Thank you. -You're welcome. For you darling the world. -Wow! You guys seem to be getting along pretty well! -You know... just breaking up and all. -You know Robbie... sometimes I just fuckin' hate you. -Where's my coffee? -I thought you skipped out on the bill. -How many times have I skipped out on the bill? -How would I know. I quit counting years ago. -There was never malice involved. -Yeah... -Just ran into Paige. -How did that go? -I think she knows. -Knows what? That you had some peeler from New Orleans buns up kneeling all night? -It was not all night. -Yeah, well the duration won't be the part that bothers her Tyler. -Whatever, you guys were going out for too long anyway. Did she tell you what she was doing last night? -I'm goin' to bed. -Thanks for the coffee, Ty! (rock music) (rock music) -Pete! -PETE! -Tyler my man! I'm so glad you made it! -What are you doing here? -I needed a place to crash buddy. What's wrong with your place? -Wendy needed to sleep, and I needed to play guitar. -I thought you needed to crash. -I took to my speed, so I'm having just a, just a little trouble sleeping. -What's that noise? -More of a place to hang my hat, I guess that's the correct terminology, but... ...fucking dildo wears hats these days, so I'm not gonna say it.... -Who's in the shower? (singing) -No Pete, I don't wanna see your muupa! I told you to stay... oh it's you. I'll be out in a minute. (guitar sound) -Take that! Fuck man! It fucking works, shit! I didn't write that! -It's fucking great! Dude, we're gonna have to fucking have, like, roadies to keep the chicks from raping us the second we play that note! -This is huge! -Paige, can we talk for a minute? -No. -What do you mean "no"? -I have to get to work! -You don't work till ten! -Yeah? -It's like, seven. -Fuck! Get that shit off man, she rocks. I hope I can fuckin' remember that! -Yes. It's good. -Right, you should be writing this... where are... you should be writing this down! -Give me a beer. Give me a beer man. Tyler? -We should go lay down man. -Yeah we should. -Now would be really good time to go lay down. -No, man, I gotta go to bed right now. -Fuck that man, we gotta do this now while fresh! Tyler if I sit on this it is gone! -See, if I go to sleep, forget it man, I'm up for at least three fuckin' days. Now we gotta lay this right fuckin' now! -Pete! -I've had a really fucked up few hours! -If I don't go to bed right now, if I don't try and write off this day, it's gonna begin to spiral! -It's gonna gather speed. And it will plummet into a hellishness so fast I won't be able to recover. -And Pete I don't want that. I don't need that. There are things out there waiting to fuck up my life! -Hi. -Hi. Sorry, I was in a hurry so, I didn't think you'd mind. -Mind what? -Me taking a shower here. -Couldn't make it all the way home. -Oh right, yeah, yeah, that's no problem. -Tyler and I are gonna lay down a few tracks. -Maybe. -That's my man! Yeah! -Could we? Could we talk for a minute? -Nope. -Stop saying that! Just give me two minutes! -No, I've got errands to run and then I've gotta go to work, so no! -It's just that... I, I wanna talk to you before... -Let's go! -See! You don't have time either. -OK. What time do you get off? -Five. -Five, OK, um... -We'll talk then? -Super. -So long Paige! Let's go chum. -Nice. -What? -It was really just a thing man. It just took hold of me, it just grabbed me and said 'this is this'! -That's not something else man, this is this. -Back um, back um, back um... (mouth music) -We're just gonna go see Ernie man, he's got that machine, all those guitars. -I bet it's gonna work! Were gonna sit there all fuckin' day just creating man. -Doing our shit! -Yeah. I feel it today man, it is coursing through my veins! -It's the speed. -It is the speed. -But the speed's unlocked the door man. It was like the combinational lock that was holding 13 amazing songs. -It has made me... it has transformed me into the prolific songstress that I am. (knocking sound) -Did you just say 'songstress'? -Tyler knocked! -What do you want? -Is this a bad time? -Ahh...yeah! It's a bad time! -Dude, we need to use your foretrack today. -Come back at noon. -What? You don't work today? -What did I just say? -Something about coming back at noon. -Very good! -Fuck! God dammit! (knocking) What are you doing? -Last night's condom's still on your dick. (snap) -Noon. And not a minute before! -That was fucking foul. -That's like, that's like three hours from now. -Yup. -I'm not sure I can hang on that long. -Got any more speed? -I'm not sure, but I thing more speed now would kill me. -PETE! -Oh God! -Jesus! -Wendy! My little love! -Hey, did you come home last night? -No, I crashed at Steve and Tyler's. -Partying on their smooth again, ha? (laugh) -Wendy! Always good for a laugh. -Um, yeah, I guess there was an extra bed, hmm? -Well this is getting ridiculous. -Don't you people have anything better to do than gossiping about my personal life? Get a hobby. -That is my hobby. -Heh. -It's all over town you know. -Yeah, apparently. -Paige was pretty upset about it. -What did she say? -She said she was pretty upset about it. -Fuck sake! She does know! -Of course she knows, how could she not know? -Because it's 9 am-ish! -Why are boys so stupid? -Because we love you so much. -Oh, baby! -'We' doesn't include me. -I'll see you at the cafe at noon! -All right? -I wanna piece of this right now! (loud music) (loud music) (people having sex sound in the background) -Joe! -Did you just say your name? -OK, get off me, get off me... -Tyler! Thank God you're here! -Hey! Thank God you're here, too. -Hey Ty! -Veronica, looking quite flush this morning. -I just fucked Joe in the bathroom. -Yeah, so I've heard. -So, what did you do last night? -You don't know? -I didn't see you, why would I know? -I went home early, I read a book. -Yeah, it was a nice change of pace. -Where's Paige? -That's a good question. Where is your darling Paige? -I hope she's not to devastated to come to work this morning Tyler. -Devastated? Why would she be devastated? -She, she's gonna be... -Why would she be devastated? -She, she... -Why would she be devastated? -Because that book he was reading last night was about a 19-year-old stripper from the Big Easy. -That was you? -Oh, I guess she's read that book. -You are very bad. -Like you should talk? -Yeah, but Paige is so sweet. -Well Ted is also very sweet, but that didn't stop you from getting a 'burrito no cheese' from his friend in the man's -The bathroom is unisex. -Tyler, remember what we were talking about yesterday? -I was giving it some thought, I think that might actually work. -Oh, yeah, the one over at Bryant and Sixth? -That's the one. -Look, I went and checked it out. It's got two exits, and it's only a block away from the freeway. -That's two blocks away from Hall of Justice. -Exactly, that's the beauty of it. We're gonna be robbing a bank two blocks from the Hall of Justice. -Police headquarters right there, this is gonna be like invading Canada, nobody's ever gonna see this incoming. -No, no, oh... -But instead of cutting out to the freeway, we get a second getaway car. We park it at the Hall. -After we suck the life out of that bank, we can go straight to the lines there. -Then we switch the rides. -Not, ready yet. -We go into the Hall, we spend a day watching the trial. -Oh that's perfect. Like, some civil shit divorce trial. We might even recognize the people we know there. -You know, we could check out the bank robbery trial, see what those guys fucked up, do a little research. -That's good thinking. -Huh, shit! This could totally work. -OK, you guys have been hashing the same dumb fucking plan for weeks now. -Veronica, robbing banks isn't this sort of thing you wanna just stroll lightly into. -Tyler, you take one step from the bank doors, and take a dump. -That'd be a hell of a diversion. -Oh, please! -You're late. -Yeah, you're really slam, too. -Really, I have time to sit down and have a smoke. Hey, girl. -Hi. -You smell. -I haven't showered yet. -You should. -Yeah. -So what did you do last night? -I crawled up with a good book. -Funny, that's exactly what Tyler did last night. -You guys are so cute. -I gotta get to work. -Well, everything seems to be in order here, so, if nobody needs me I'm gonna go do something important. -Ciao! -See you. -I know that I have to explain, I know that. I don't expect... -What can I get you? -I'm not interrupting, am I? Well, you kind of are. -No, no. Shone, what do you want? -What time is it? -Ten till ten. -Too early for a beer, can I have a cup of coffee? -Sure. Look, I feel like a... -Can I have a sesame beagle, too? -I... I feel like I should say something but... but I don't exactly know what to say. -So don't say anything. -Come on! It can't happen like this! -That's funny because it is. -Hey, you want tomato with that? -Good God yes! -It's just that I worry it's gonna sound, um... trite, or something. -And I don't want it to sound that way. -I wish to God that we were alone right now, because I have a few things I'd like to say to you. But we're not, so leave. -Oh Paige come on. (phone rings) -I have to work until five, OK? -That's seven straight hours of all of our friends coming in and giving me their sympathetic bullshit. -That's what I have to deal with! -What I don't have to deal with is you following me all morning like a retarded puppy while I'm trying to work! -So leave, please! Go! Bathe! (phone rings) -That bathing thing... I'm with her in all of it. (laugh) -Shut up! -Oh good Lord! -Hey, crimestoppers! -Gosh! -Son of a bitch! -What's up? Come on, I switched to coffee, let's go! -Fucking up, chill out man. -Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, let's go, let's go, let's go! -Where are we going? -We're going swimming! -I'm not going swimming. I'm going out there to take a shower and then I'm going in there to go the bed. -No, no, swim and shower, it's the same thing, come on! -I really gotta go to bed. -No, you really gotta go. You will be missing something very big! -You think so? -Very big! (funky music) -Joe! -Hello ladies! -What's up spankie! -Hey! You bastards better have ice! -And you wanted to stay home! -I still wish I was home. -Check this. -Hello beautiful citizens of North Beach! -Hey Veronica! Hey Ty! -Hey dork! -To whom can I make sweet, sweet love? -You made it! -You better be a woman, please, be the woman! -Oh, Michelle! Oh, good God! -Of course I made it! It's not officially social until I show up! -Hey this is Veronica, and this is Tyler. Tyler... -I think you know Michelle. Michelle? You know Tyler? -I thought I did. -OK, all my work's done. Veronica, let's go find the blender! -Yes sir! -Bye. -How you doing? -Can't complain. -How's Paige? -So you know about Paige. -Not until I got here and said 'We should call Tyler'. -And someone said you were probably busy explaining to Paige where you were last night. -That's when I said 'Who is Paige?' That's pretty much how I found out about her. -Sorry about that. -Mhm. -Well OK then, I'm going to go get a drink and... -Go get one, then come join us. -Aaaa! (scream) -Hey bitch! -Hey! Hey, you owe me five bucks man! -Hey Tyler! -Hey, how you doing? -You want salt? -No, I'm good. -Have a nice reunion with your lost love? -About that, dick head! Why didn't you tell me she was gonna be here? -Cause you'd have done something stupid, like stay home! -He was just doing what's best for you. -Yeah. You need to confront your demons. -She is one spectacular demon. -Cheers. -Cheers! -Cling-cling baby! -God damn it's hot! -No shit! Let's hit the surf! -Maybe we should've invite Paige to stop by after she gets off work. -There are a lot of people who can give me shit, but after this morning, you are not one of them. -What happened this morning? -Sparky! Think mine are double! -Hey! -Hey, don't leave me hanging man. What happened this morning? -Nothing. -OK. Fuck you then. -How's the water girls? -What happened? Library closed? -Yeah! At least I go to class. -What did you mose do all morning? -Not much. -That's what I figured. -I'm gonna go change. -OK. -Ted, you're probably the only guy I know who carries his swimsuit in his backpack on the off chance of an impromptu a -That's right Tyler, it's a pool party. Lose the leg warmers. -Oh yeah, that's really funny book boy. -Couple of hoes is what we are. (pop music) (pop music) -What the fuck is 'sticky pumice' for? -The perfect compliment to apply that the mongolian beef would be a sexy -Well, what goes with redheads? -Compound chicken? Ouch! (pop music) -I have to go home. -What he hell do you have to do? -I dunno, something. -I gotta talk to Paige. -Haha, yeah! -You fucked her over good. -I still don't know what she was up to last night. -This is your thing, Paige didn't do anything last night. You're the one who fucked up. -What did you do last week? -What night? -Any night. Any night last week, what did you do? -Like... Thursday? -Yes, like Thursday, Thursday is fine. -I don't fuckin' know, I don't know what I did an hour ago. -I know what you did. -Do you? -The same thing you're gonna do tonight. And the same thing you did last week. -Why are you getting in my shit? -No, I'm trying to make a point. -You know, if you're having some crisis that you're going through, that's fine, but don't put your shit on me! -I am just trying to say... -Ahh, fuck it! -No, go ahead. -I think I'm lucid again. -I am just saying that we do the same shit every night, over and over again. Same shit, with the same people every night it's the same thing. -We could go to Berkeley tonight. -It's the same thing. -It's not the same thing, it's fucking Berkeley. -So yeah, OK, fine, we go to Berkeley. -And we take the same crowd because we can't possibly do anything without each other. So we all go to the same bar, we sit in some corner and bag on all the people we don't know. We drink the same drinks we drink in the city and at some point, we will all l decide that the East Bay sucks. -We jump on the bridge, and then go back to North Beach, and then there we are, doing the same thing we do every night. -But... it'll be a few hours later. -So we get a later start on the same thing. (splash) Woooohooo! (laughs) -Looks like I need another dink. (latino music) -We're all creatures of habit my friend. -We need routine. Routine makes us feel safe. -Routine is the friend you see every day, it's the girlfriend you wake up with! -Or that you're supposed to wake up with. -Yeah, but our life... -I'm not done talking yet! -Here, taste it. -More tequila. -Aahh! Thank you! See! -You want more tequila! -Because you are used to a certain amount, you don't wanna change! -Routine should count for, I dunno, 25-30% of our total being. -Is that an actual figure... -It's a public fact! Look it up! -It's there to keep us in check. (sigh) -Perfect. -But, the thing about routine is that even when you're deep into it there's always a chance that something will jump up and pull you out. -So you're never really safe. -Every day I stroll down at the cafe. -Mhm. -I get three cups of coffee, and I go get the paper, and I come back and have two more. -Joe and I sit there commenting on the news and planning bank robberies. -Paige comes in around ten, I hang out, talk to her for a while, then I go home. -I have no plans for anything beyond what I'm gonna do that night. -I am... totally and completely nowhere. (rock music) -Wake up! -Where am I? -Oh, I know you guys. -Get up, go sleep on my couch! -Can you carry me? -Go! -Shit! Do you know whose car this is? -Robbie's? -Robbie doesn't have a fuckin' car. -Hey Robbie! Whose car is this? -It's my sister's! She's in Boston for a week! -Okay, let's park it. -Could there be something down? -I don't see anything. -Don't look where I'm looking, look over on the other side, I got this side. -Anything, anything, anything? -To the right, to the right. -I'm not going that way, are you nuts? -Aahh! -Nothing. Nothing. -I'm very proud of you. -Why's that? -The 19-year-old. You didn't lay a hand on her. -Ohh! -I thought about it. -Thought about it. -Well, the old Tyler would've done a lot more than think. -What? So now I'm the a... new improved Tyler now? -No. Now you're in love. (braking sound) -That right there? -Hardly. -Woo! Nice car Tyler! -Hey! -You are, you know. -What? -In love. -And you think you need to tell me what I am or am not? -Aaa! Aaaa! -What!? -You just missed one. -Where? -Back there. -Oh, it's a fuckin' fire hydrant! -Oops! My bad. -All right, fuck this! -People have been asking me whole day: "What were you thinking?" -Yeah? What did you tell them? I don't know, nothing. Smile, walk away... -I don't know, I don't know what I was thinking. -You weren't thinking. You were just being you. -Thanks. -What? You weren't aware you had a weakness for the ladies? -Oh, come on, it's the same thing I do. It's the same thing we all do. -It's all about the game. You can't fart on our beach without every single one of our friends smelling it! -Jesus! Come on now, you're a girl, you can't go around talking about farts. -Shut up! -Look, we all know each other inside and out. And I mean that literally. -Since we pretty much all slept together. So, the only thing to do is play the game. -And since we all play it, normally its not a problem. Just Paige wasn't playing. -And you my friend told her you are out, so now you gotta pay. Or you could just shake it off. -That's what you usually do. -Yeah, I wish could. -I'm glad you can't. -So, you wanna go back to my lace and fuck? -Let's just go to the cafe. -OK. -You think Paige's still working? -Is it still Tuesday? -I don't know. -What the hell, like, I'm still going there. -Maybe i should hang back a little. -Why? -Well, you are a known slut. -Takes one to know one. -Ahh. You sure the car's OK there? -It'll be fine. -I put the hazards on. -Bitches! What's up!!? -Hi. -You look a little cleaner. -Yeah, I went swimming. -Pit's been here since noon looking for you. -Oh, fuck! I forgot about that! -Yeah, I figured but he said "Naah, he'll be here, my boy won't let me down." -Well I'm here. -Yeah. -And I'm sure if Pit wasn't in the middle of a meth crash, he'd tell you glad he is. -Oh, and he'd also tell you that you are playing tonight at the "Lost and Found". -What? -That's what the man said. -Pete! Pete! -What? Ouch! -Oh, Tyler, thank God you're here man, I'm so glad to see you. We're playing tonight at "Lost and Found"! -Told ya. -Sound check is at four. What time is it? -3:55. Shit! -Aren't you gonna go? -In a minute. -Will you come tonight? -Hmm... I don't think I can. -How come? -I kinda have a date. -With who? -Just some guy I met. -Some guy you met? -Yeah. -Are we breaking up here or what? 'Cause this is actually what I wanna talk about. -Do you wanna break up? -No, no, I wanna talk. -We can do that! -You are going on some date? -Yeah. -So, you're breaking up with me. -I know where you were last night, and you know I know. -And I'm sure you're expecting me to freak out, and cry, and ask you: "Oh how could you do that to me?" -I am sorry, I am not going to break up with you over it. But, because of it, I will be going on a date. -And I will act very impressed with his money and I'll compliment hi tie, and I'll drink, a lot. -So now, it's up to you. You can continue going out with a girl who goes out on Yappie dates or you can break up with me, and it won't matter to you who I go out with. -Keep your dignity dude, dump her! -He's right man! You'll look like an ass if you stay with her. -What are you talking about, he cheated on her. It's his fucking fault! -I do love you. -Pussy! -Would you shut up? -Tyler for fuck sake! -You're late for sound check. -You fucker! (hard rock music) (hard rock music) -Gimme a fuckun' A. That's an A. -That's an A. -Glad you could make it pretty boy. You wanna get to work some time today? -I'm just catching my breath here. -That cigarette will help. -Why are you using the PA, I'm right fucking here? -Trying to make you hacks feel like the big time. -OK, let's do this! -Testing, testing one, test... it sounds great! -Hey, where are you going? -Tyler, get your ass back on the stage! -We're supposed to practice dickwad! (hard rock music) (hard rock music) -She's gone man, I let her go early. -Pathetic! (laughs) (hard rock music) -Hey, Tyler! (puking sound) -Jesus dude! You ate the fish? -Ran from cafe. -Too much smoking. -Well you wanna go back to the cafe? That's where I'm heading, but I'm walking. (breathing heavily) -No! I... I would... -I'm just gonna go to the side for a while. -All right, OK. -Hey, I'll see you tonight, I hear you're playing. -Yeah. -Right, I'll see you tonight. -Hey! Paige's in there? -No! I haven't seen her since this morning. -See you at seven! -Aaaa! (scream) -What's the matter with you? -We're playing n two and a half hours! -Four blocks away, what's the hurry? -You haven't even looked at the new lyrics, I know because I still have them! -We're not doing the new stuff. -We have to! -Why do we have to? -Hey! -What's up? -Because we do! -Tyler, don't disappoint fellas. -You're ruining my day. -You're ruining his day. -Cross the path man. -How long has this been in your fridge? -It won't take long. No, I just need to talk to you. No, it has absolutely nothing to do... it is not a direct result of anything! -Come on man, chop, chop! -Hey, hey, hey! What? -Um, yeah, oh it's the band... -Thanks. So be late! -Listen, please just don't go. -What's up dude? She gave you the highest one? -Yeah. She don't wanna be late. -It's cold man, sorry. -Anyway, new lyrics. -It's better than shit you used to write. -Why are you here? -It's personal favor to me man. -Because I know all your songs by heart! Since you've been playing the same six songs forever! -Now you got this new shit! Which means, I gotta learn how to mix it, I gotta shop for my whole lighting package. -Lighting package!? -You got like a coffee can and some light bulbs! -You wanna play in the dark?! -Listen, I ain't got all day! So let's get the fucking show on the road there pretty boy! -Ty, I'm thinking to start with this little... -It's gonna... -Start with me getting out the door! -Come on man, we gotta do this shit! Fuck! -Great, great Steve! Go back there! -You are really fucking with the energy in here Ernie! -Hope you sleep well! Go, come on, Joe, it's time for practice... -I'm not messing with anybody's energy. -Where is she? -Tyler! -What a pleasant surprise. I thought you'd be off bonking some stripper. -Where is she going? -You're running all over town looking for her? -That's what I'm about to. -Good dog! -Come on, just help me out. Where would she go? -Sorry Ty, but I'm sworn to secrecy. -I enjoy watching you bag. -I've been chasing around all damn day and if I don't find her and explain things to her then... -I'm going to follow you around all night long, bugging the piss out of you unless you tell me where she is! -Knock yourself out. -I'll scream raunch. -Eeek! -She's meeting him here. -Oh God, thank you, thank you. -Why don't you keep him company? He is sitting right over there in the corner. -The dark candlelit corner? -Yeah. -Did you sit them there? -No. He sat himself. -Hi. -Hello. -Oh, um... are you my server? -My what? -Server, waiter... -Your server, ha, no, no, funny but no, I'm not your server. -Sweet suit. -Do I know you? -Do you know me? Like did we go to high school together, or were we like childhood friends? -Because no we didn't, and no we weren't. -Okay, is there something I can do for you? -Unbelievable. Tyler! -Hey, how you doing? God, you look great! -Am I in the middle of something? -No, no! -Yeah, actually. -I just wanna talk to you. -You have no right to do this. -I know, I'm sorry. -Then get the fuck out of here. -Sorry I'm late, I wanted to change out of my work clothes. I am so glad that we are finally doing this... -I'm really sorry about that. -No, no, he's right. -You do look great. -Oh! Thank you. -You're welcome. -Too-to-loo! (soft music) (soft music) -Shit! -Ladies and gentleman, the rage of the Yucatan peninsula... BINGE!! (applause) (crowd cheering) -I'm here, I'm here! -Super. -I'm here. -Thanks for showing up. -No problem. -Hey, how you doin'? We're Binge. -One, two, three, four (rock music) (rock music) -I don't know this song! -What?! -Shut up! -It's the new shit! -I said we weren't doing the new shit. -I said we were. -Freebird. -I got your freebird right there! -We are the world! -Little technical difficulty here, nothing to worry about. -Shit... -You see, Pit here... -He wrote a whole bunch of new songs... -Thirteen! -And, I've had a relatively bad day. -Actually it all kinda started last night. -I heard you had an awesome night! -Yeah, that's right, I forgot that everyone here knows everything. -Well the thing is... I messed up last night. (slow music starts in the background) -There's not much I can do about that. -I said there's not too much I can do about that. -'Cause last night I did something very stupid and I can blame it on being drunk I can blame it on what? My purine retrograde? -The thing is though... the fact that would matter is... -I fucked up. -I fucked up. -Today, I tried to fight a battle and I lost. -My chest is tight... up and down, it's crazy beat. -In dark kind of grooves in a... in a band with Pit! (crowd scream) -I spent all day today, all day, trying to fix what's broken, trying to make amends, trying to pull back what I spoke all day... spent trying to fix yesterday today... trying to fix yesterday... -Lost day... -And all this muddle, all this crazy shit clears up that I had been into the brothel... -Something was born... -Something was born... -Something, kinda big mothafucking attitude! -And something slapped across the head, something sad... (music) -Wake up! (music) -Wake up! (cheering crowd) (cheering crowd) (cheering crowd) -Good morning people, I'm up! -You rock Tyler! -And right now, I feel quite alive, and all of you helped me feel that way so... -So why don't you sign on up to the bar there and grab yourselves a drink and... you know, hang out. We'll see what happens. -I would like to dedicate this next song, Pete's new song, to Paige. She's not here right now, but she's the reason I am. -So, I'd like to sing her this little song called 'ASS FACE' Hit it! -Tyler, come one! Principessa! Tyler, Jesus man! -Come on! That was awesome, you're a fuckin' rock star! Where are you going? -I'm, I'm going to get her back. -Hey, cool man! Then let's go celebrate man! We'll have a beer! -There's nothing to celebrate yet! -Oh there will be man, I have faith. You'll get Paige back. -Come on, let's go, take the edge off! Get crazy! -Go get her champ! -No! God! (faster latino music) -What are you doing? -Jesus! Don't creep up on people! -What the hell are you doing? -I am... -You think they are banging in the bathroom or something? -No, no I... (slap) -That is for cheating on the sweetest girl in the world! (slap) -And that is for fucking up her date. -You're right. -It's my bad. I deserve that. -I'm not doing well with this whole thing. -Whatever Tyler! -Coffee? -That would be nice. -It's not like there isn't precedent for carnal bathroom... whatever... -Like Joe and Veronica. -How did you know about that? -I don't know, somebody told me. -Paige said they were just gonna go for a walk. -Go home. -That's too much inactivity right now. -I thought you are a big fan of inactivity. -That's the old me. -I'm the new improved 'taker the world by the balls' type now. -Good for you. -Keep your own balls in your own pants and it will be just fine.-Thanks. -I appreciate the help. -Tyler! Tyler! What's up man? -Hey, what's up? -Hey. Have you seen Veronica? -No. -After we all went swimming, you didn't see her? -You know what I was doing all damn day, why are you asking me all these fucking questions? -She's gonna break up with me, isn't she? -Why are you asking me? -Just tell me. Why?!! (crying) (sobbing) -How could this had happened? Oh, Jesus! -Tyler, you gotta get her back for me! -You gotta get her back for me! You could do it! You could do it! She's my life man. -I need her to live. Without her I can't breathe, I mean, you gotta get her back! -Didn't you tell me last week you needed to break up with her? -Yeah, but, I thought I needed my space. I thought she was smothering me, but... but, that is not the case! -I mean, I feel, I feel like I'm drowning! -I never knew you had a flare for the dramatic. -I feel very, deeply... -And what are you going to do about that whole Cameron thing? -Who's Cameron? -It's that guy, that Paige is dating. -Cameron? His name is Cameron? -Yeah. Yeah, nice guy all in all too. -He's a nice guy. -What?! -Fucker makes pang too. -How do you know this guy? He is a suit! We hate suits. -I dunno, from around. He's at a cafe in the mornings. -What does she do? -She works at the cafe. -I know where she fucking works! What does she do when he's after her? -She talks to him. -She talks to him. -Yeah. It's like 'Hey, how you doing' or 'Oh Gee, I'm flattered but I have a boyfriend.' -Shit like that. -I gotta go. -Hey! -I'm gong to find her! -Thanks for the beer! (cool music) (cool music) (cool music) (cool music) (cool music) (cool music) -Tyler! We've seen a lot of you today! -Can I get a beer? -You always see a lot of me. -Hey Ty, what's up? -Steve, what's happening? -I just got off work shift! -That's a long day. -No shit! -Hey Joe, two PBRs! -I already got one. -Oh, it's not for you. -Okay then. -So, I heard your gig went really well tonight. -Yeah, we did alright today. -I also heard that Paige had a date with some suit. -Thanks Joe, put it on my tap. -Yeah right Steve, you gotta job. Let's see some cash on the bar. -Love you too sweetheart. -I wouldn't put it that way. -It's just what I heard. -I think you heard wrong since it's a little more convoluted than that. -Well, then, that's probably why your gig went so well. -You haven't seen her, have you? -No. -I decided to spend the rest of the night... the rest of my life searching for her. -Was that Alison's place you came out of this morning? -Yup. -What's going on there? -I don't know, sometimes something. Sometimes something. -Yeah, I hear that! -So, where are you gonna look for her? -I don't know, I've already been everywhere. -Wandering around aimlessly searching for her. -Till I run into somebody I know, then I sit down, have beer with them, pick the brain... -Are you ready to resume your quest? -As soon as I finish my beer. -All right, you let me know. - And I'll let you know that she just walked in with the suit and sitting by the window. (giggle) -Go get them tiger! -That's what I say to him.... -Really? (laugh) -Hi. Might if I sit a spell? -Tyler... -Cameron right? Tyler. -Nice to see you again Tyler. -You guys don't actually know each other, do you? -No. -Oh, sure. We met at the 'Dillon' restaurant up the street, the one with all the candles... very cozy. -How was your waitress? -She has a big mouth. -You wanna get out of here? -No, no absolutely not. -Go away! -Will you be coming home tonight? -Wait a minute, you guys live together? -No, no! -Well we alternate. Sometimes it's my place, sometimes it's her place. -She lives on Russian Hill, so usually it's my place. -Tyler! -Well, you do! -You even have a toothbrush at my house. I don' have one at her house, though. Whenever I'm there we share. -You know what? Maybe I should go. You guys obviously have a lot to talk about. Paige, we can talk later. -There won't be a later pall. -That's it, get up! You stay right there! -I won't move. -I promise. -Really? Thank you. I'll be right back. -Crazy kids. You know the have been crazy about each other ever since the peace corps. -A Peace Corps? -Yup. Two years in Zimbabwe. -That's the couple bonding in equivalent of serving in them. -I just wanted to talk to you! All day long, I just wanted to talk to you. -I've been around all day. -I know but, you know, Pete, he waned to rehears, and we had a show tonight and Robby, he dragged me at lame pool party, and Lou wasn't much help. -Jesus! You gotta be the busiest fucking slacker on God's green earth. -But the second I am on a date, the second I'm busy, you've got nothing but time. -We could've talk last night Tyler, where were you then? -Last night, we didn't need to talk last night. -Last night is what we need to talk about. -No. We've needed to talk for a long time, but we're not doing it now. -Cause I am going inside and I am talking to my date. -Speaking of this date, what do you see in this guy? What is it? Is it the suit? Cause it's nice fucking suit and all but it's just a suit. Clothes do not make the man. -You know what, he's nice and I am having a nice time. -Nice, he's nice. -Yeah. -And considerate, and interesting and he listens. -Ha? What? -Oh fuck... -No, no, wait, come on! I'm kidding! I'm kidding! -I used to do all that considerate shit when we first started going out. -You better leave now because you are being a real asshole. -I'm sorry. -Naked as the day they were born... -Steve! -Paige! -I was just killing time with your buddy here. No hard feelings, right? -Yeah. -Bye Steve! -I am so sorry about that. He is like totally crazy and I don't know what to do about it. -Do you think that they went to the Crow bar? -Where else!? -Right. Nice to meet you pall. -Hey sailor? Can I by you a drink? -Come on, try not to get in trouble tonight. -It's Tuesday, what can happen? (pop music) I told you right? I fuckin' said, this is some kinda new, weird kinda day man, did I not? -All the doors have been opened man, tonight we hit the new level. -Yeah, we did OK tonight. -Yes we did. -Yes we did! -Well, well... what with all the big talk about breaking routine and changing your life and all that? -This is the last place I expected to see you. -Rome wasn't built in a day Robbie. -I do believe it collapsed in a day, though. -You wanna shoot some pool? -Yeah. -I've come to a new revelation. -Since earlier today? -I just kind of expanded on that one. -It has like fifty names up here! -There's five people in the bar. -Start calling me Dave. -Who's next Dave? -I believe we are Pablo! -Oh my! We're playing doubles. -All right girls... -It came to me when I was on stage. -Al least that's where I first start noticing it. -Noticing what? -That feeling. -Oh, right, on stage. -Right. -Excuse me ladies. -We're solids. -Pardon? -Solids! -Oh, it woild be good to know that. -So was it a good feeling? -It was just a feeling. It's the one I hadn't felt in a long time. -Kinda the way Paige makes me feel. She makes me feel like doing something. -Yeah. Well stick with the music thing because you were so good tonight. -My voice wasn't so hot. -Ever hear of Lou Reed? Man's a tone deaf genius! -Yo, speakin of Lou, she accused me of being chronically inactive. -Which one is Lou. -Paige's friend, she works over at Louise's. -Oh, yes, I know her. -She's unspeakably hot. -Yeah. -I should fuck her. -Yeah, you do that. -Just feel like I can do anything right now. With all the shit that happened today I gotta do something. -Stop doing nothing. -Hey look at that, your shot. -Very nice, very nice. A four rail scratch, that is unprecedented. -I had no shot. -It's just that I can go to the same places every day. I can talk to the same people every day. -It's not these edifices that are the problem. -Is that the right word? -Edifices? -Yeah. -I don't know. -The thing is that I can put myself into a routine, and I can take myself out of the routine. -It's up to me. -I find that empowering. -Super. -But can I tell you something? You need to think long and hard about the routines you take yourself out of. -Paige is a good routine. -Don't be a fucking idiot. -Eight ball, corner pocket. -We just lost! -Sorry. -Well, well, well, very nice ladies. Loser buys. -Oh, you guys are very cute... Hey! Paige! -Oh my God! -That's awful, what is that? (coughing) -Hi. -Hi. -Wendi. -Tyler. -Where's Camper? -Cameron. -Right. -He had to go home. He has a job. -Good for him. -Aren't you gonna buy me a beer? -Hey Joe, can I get to beers? -Yeah. -I'm glad you're here. -Paige! Darling, you've arrived! Clink-clink! -Barkeep, whatever this beautiful woman wants! -No, baby I'm good. -Splendid! -You going out with him again? -I dunno. He's not really my type. -Yeah, I agree. -I kissed him for a while though. -For a while? -Yeah, you know. -No, I don't think I wanna... Why did you kiss him for a while? -You know... -I was up at his place having a nightcap. That's the kind of drink people with jobs have before calling it a night. -He kept telling me how beautiful I am, and really wanted me to spend the night. -So it just made sense that I kiss him for a while. -Up at his place. -God it's huge, compared to yours. -Anything else happened? -Other than kissing? -I'm not gonna tell you. -What do you mean you're not gonna tell me? -Not gonna tell you. -I may have had boot slamming sex with him. -What, with that guy? Come on! -I may have only let him feel me up. -Or maybe I was thinking about you so much, that I made up the part about making up with him just to make you jealous when, in truth, I went home to my fluffy pink bedroom to write in my deary about how dreamy you are. -Or maybe I went down on him, wrapping my soft lips around his rock hard... -OK, OK!! -And the truth is, you'll never know the truth. -And any time you doubt me remember this, I can do whatever you can do only unlike you and your loudmouth friends, I can be discrete. -So you, you are no mad anymore? -I never was mad. That's what I found so upsetting? -Strangely enough, I think I understand. -So what now? -I don't know. -All I know is that you are pretty much all I've been thinking about all day. -That's a really good answer. "If you really love me you'll find me..." -I think you should take me home now. -Really? -Yeah, I really do. -I think you should take me home, drop me off, go to your own home. -Get a good night's rest. And tomorrow we'll both wake up with clear heads and meet for breakfast. -Does this mean you'll give me another chance. -If you wanna call it that. -Yeah! I do wanna call it that. -Fuck my liver! -Robbie, I owe you a beer. -Are you and Paige back on? -We're gonna figure it out. -Paige! Same time, 7 am! -Can't, I got a date! -So, I guess this means that you and I ain't gonna happen. -I'm single now, you know? -I know! And it pains me that I'm not! -Bye! -Fucker! (romantic music) (romantic music) The theory is that nothing ever changes here. Beginning to think that's not true. Sometimes I barely recognize the place. It's the people that are always the same. It's a pretty fucking sophisticated way to describe a bunch of dropouts from the slacker generation. But today, something knocked me out of my little rut. Maybe it was fate, maybe it was bad timing, so whatever reason, I fought something I can't fight. The Earth rotates once a day, evolves around the Sun once a year. Spring is always spring and there is absolutely nothing you can do about the holidays. Maybe Robbie is right. Maybe we are destined for routine, that's why we think we are able to see the future. I don't know. Beginning to think that doesn't apply to me anymore. The only thing I know is that for now and at least till half of tomorrow I'm with Paige. Whatever happens after that, it's up to me. Fuck fate! It's overrated. -You know what, I need some coffee or something... What are you doing? -That looks like my sister's car. -Weird. Why do you think she parked it there? -I don't know. -Oh, well... -She went to Boston for a week.
