What happened to the scanning report? Just come down. - I mean the neuro patient. - Okay. - Sir. Just come down. - I mean the neuro patient. - Okay. - Sir. Yes. - How's dad? Come. Are you asking me after driving negligently? Get first aid soon. - Is the injury serious? It's not serious. But he has lost a lot of blood. Aren't your blood group B+ve? - Yes. Test his blood. - Yes, Doctor. - Is there anything to be worried? Don't worry. I'll take care of it. - No. - Go. Give me a break, Thomas. Just a second. I'll call you back. Sorry. Okay, I head to the fast lane. It's my mistake. Sorry, Dad. That's okay. Thank him and come. Will it be awkward if I thank him? - Go. Stay here, Dad. I'll be right back. Okay? - Okay. - Yes. Good afternoon, Doctor. - What's this? Isn't this a hospital? Okay, then. I've prescribed medicines for him. Make sure that he takes them. Don't simply roam around. - Okay. Why.. Why are you being anxious? Whatever it is, tell me. Do you want to smoke? - Dad.. - That's okay, I'll handle it. Oh, God. So polite! Come.. Yes. Take it. Now don't.. - Sorry, I don't smoke cheap cigarettes. Is it? Thank you. - Why are you thanking me? - For giving back my dad. What did I do? I just treated him. One month. It was terrible. Is it so hard to adjust in my hospital? - Nothing. Dad was in the hospital, I was at home. The cook wasn't there. Dad was in the hospital, I was at home. The cook wasn't there. I was tired of cooking. - That's why you need to marry. Sir! I have a lot of things to enjoy. There are many entertainments like late nights, movies.. I have my studies and racing apart from that. I mean, I've so many things to do. So, were you practising racing that day too? No, I do it alone. - Why do you drive fast? Driving slow is really nice. Won't the guy behind us overtake us if we go slow? What if an accident happens? - I'll die then. Only two days, sir. That's all. Is life that easy? - Death is easier. Okay, It's easy for you. What if something happens to me? - You'll be lucky. I'll be happy. Great idea, sir. - Are you happy with my death? What did you mean by that? Do you like your life? You wake up every morning and come here. Then there will be the dean, the nurse, the operation theatre dad and me. Won't you get bored? Death is freedom. Freedom! What if your dad gets this freedom? What? He's strong. Nothing will happen to him. What? It's happening. Don't kill my dad as I talked about your death. Do you know something? You're funny. But don't joke. Look, Raja. Science is not a joke. What did you say? We'll always test the blood if an accident happens. We found an unknown cell growth in his blood sample. When I looked at it magnified, I found that it was MS. What's M.S? - Multiple Sclerosis. What is Multiple Sclerosis? It's normally found in countries with cold climate. That too in one in a million. Shanmugham is that one. Why did he get it? What is happening to him? - His culture reports came. What is happening to him? - His culture reports came. And? - Cell fission has started. It's spreading by every passing minute. No.. Tell me the way I can understand. Cell fission.. I don't get it. He will live for 60 more days according to my calculation. From the 61st day, each part of his body will start to fail. After that, the system will collapse. One fine day, he'll be free, like you said. Sixty days? - Yes. What's this, sir? Damn it! Why are you so calm? Shouldn't we treat him? Tell me the cost. I'll get it from the bank or sell the factory. I want my dad. How can you sit like.. - Hey.. Don't shout. I'm treating him. You don't have to tell me. He was my friend long before he became your dad. Nothing can be done. Nothing. Nothing can be done. Nothing. Does he know? - No. - What if he comes to know? That's the nature of this disease. It won't be visible until death. Neither the patient nor his family would know anything. What will I do, sir? - Live for him from now onwards. Didn't you get it? He came here with your mom, 25 years ago. Your mom passed away while giving birth to you. I asked him to go back rather than raising you alone here. Whether it was a burden or a loss he didn't want anyone to sympathise with you and so he stayed here. He lived for your happiness and he still is. Now, you've got a chance to return that favour. I'll do whatever it takes. Tell me. Your dad should be the happiest man alive for the next 60 days. Your dad should be the happiest man alive for the next 60 days. You can do it. What can't be cured with medicines can be cured by heart. Make him happy. Keep him happy. Go ahead. 'Your dad should be' 'the happiest man alive for the next 60 days.' 'You can do it.' 'What can't be cured with medicines can be cured by heart.' 'Make him happy. Keep him happy.' 'Go ahead.' Dad. Hi, Dad. What is this? What is happening? - What is happening? This is a hospital. - This is a hospital. This is not a mental asylum. - This is not a mental asylum. What the hell is happening here? - What the hell is happening here? What happened? - What happened? You, fool! - You, fool! Sreeni. - Sreeni. Come here. Ask him what is wrong with him. Ask him what is wrong with him? Enough games. - Come. Let him take rest. - Go with him. Take care of him. Go. - Okay. "Why is my brother" "Why is my brother" "so quiet?" - Apple? "Look at him, Sister-in-law." "Why is he like this?" - Hey! What is there in that movie for you to be engrossed in it? Just a nostalgia. Do you miss home? - A big house like this. A big family. We used to get together in the evenings. It felt like a festival. "Your sister-in-law.. - Brother.." I miss everything. "Congratulations.." "The union of two hearts" "is the most important of all the ceremonies." "Oh, God." "Oh, God." "Oh, God." Dad! - What? Why don't we go back to our hometown? No. - Why so? It has been 25 years. It has been 25 years. They haven't even sent a letter. I am as good as dead to them. Let things be the way they are. Something tells me that they are looking for us. Please, Dad. Why don't we just go? Agree to it.. Please. Okay? - No. No. - No, Dad. Look over here. What is there for us here? It is just a concrete jungle along with some lights. Remember how you used to talk about the mud roads, bullock carts and the trees.. What was it called? - Palm trees. Yes, palm trees. The village ponds and the village beauties that bathe there.. And.. - Hey, it is all okay. Is, it? Thank you, Dad. - No. I will complete all of the formalities. - No. Ticket, Visa and everything else. I will just be back. - No.. What? Don't get over excited. Please, Dad. - No, we shall not go! Dad. - No.. I'll drop it if you don't want to go. Is that okay? - Okay. Is that okay? - Okay. Is it okay? - Okay.. Is it fine here or back home? Yes! Thank you, Dad. It feels so good here, Dad. I had warned you against riding in a car. But you didn't listen. Did you go to school through these paths? We used to have classes under any random tree shade. That is.. - I know. That is a bullock cart. "Fresh harvest is enjoyed in its purest state." Get ready to be scolded by grandpa. You fled to some foreign land after all. Enjoy! Dad. Veeru. Hey! Get inside. I told you to go inside. Well, that goes for everybody. Dad! What is he saying? - I don't know. Did you understand anything? - I can't get a thing. Okay, come. What.. - Where to? Where are you going? I told them to leave. Who are they, Dad? Whom are you talking about? - I asked them to go. Don't you dare call them back! Keep that in mind. Damn! - As if.. I can't understand a thing. Damn! - Let us take a look. Who is it? Sister. - Who is he? Who is he? I don't know. - Brother. Stop right there. Are you fine? Oh, no! - Don't. Leave me. How many years has it been? We didn't even know if you were alive.. Why are you testing us? Let it be. Did you think about your sisters? I am sorry. I won't argue about my decisions. Come, let us go inside and talk. You are calling me inside and dad wants me to leave. He had barred me from coming in back then. I have come alone now. All alone. He didn't even invite me in. He wasn't sitting outside to kill time. He was sitting there expecting your arrival. Twenty five years of grief. That's what is in his mind. Let it be. Where is Gayathri? Okay, come in. That's my son, Sister. He is the little one. - What? Yes.. Glad you could make it before the wedding. Aunt Amritha. - Yes. Aunt Suguna and Aunt Bhaanu. Suguna, Bhaanu. - No. Aunt Bhaanu and Aunt Suguna. No, Suguna and Bhaanu. Suguna.. - No.. I am Suguna. - Bhaanu and Suguna. Am I right? - She is Suguna. Suguna and Bhaanu. - She is Bhaanu. Damn! Ask Thamara to get a lamp to greet him. Ask her to get that. He really has no shame. I had sent him off and now he has come back. What is wrong with the ladies? Dim-witted women! Jackasses. What on earth are they talking over there? Nobody in this house seems to listen to me these days. Give me the bag. I will carry it. Stand next to your father. - Oh, no! Bless you. Come. It is okay. Yes! Are you asking me to go there and meet him? Is that my grandson with him? - Yes. So what? Get lost. I said, get lost! Brother-in-law, look at them. Sister, where is your son? - He's here. - Leave him. Brother-in-law, this is my elder daughter. She's studying in college now. Get his blessings, dear. Come on. God bless you, dear. Brother-in-law, this is my second daughter, Divya. That's my elder daughter, Chithira. Isn't she the bride-to-be? - Yes.. You were not present for our wedding. Dear, you're very lucky. Your uncle is present for your wedding. God bless you. Wish you all the best. Shanmugham, go and freshen up! - Yes, Sister. I'll come. - Come. Come, let's have breakfast. - I forgot about that. Hey, Thamara. - Yes? - Wait. Where are you rushing to? Can't you see who's back? Go and get them buttermilk. Go, dear. No one told me about this girl. Brother-in-law, she is the daughter of a servant we had before, Moorthy. Oh, is she Moorthy's daughter? Do you know him? Yes, he wasn't just a servant here. He was also my best friend. I heard that he passed away. Leave it. So, is she a servant here? No, your dad considers her as a member of this family. So, he treats her as his own daughter. Oh, I see.. - Where are you going? This is too heavy. 'The respect and the goodwill of this family..' 'The lives of your sisters..' 'Do you consider your love above all these?' 'I'll tell you something.' 'Get rid of this girl and come back.' 'And if she's more important to you' 'you shall go away with her to wherever you want.' 'But don't come back to me. - Okay, Dad.' 'I won't come back. Don't worry.' Dad! How dare he call me dad! Traitor! I'm the king of this house. Hey, is it that toy that's speaking? Yes, it's me. What's your name? - Rekha. Good name. And what about yours? Nisha. - Why are you so quiet? Are you dumb? No, my name is Mukhesh. - What about you, dear? Hareesh. - What about your name? - Hemalatha. But you haven't told us your name yet. - It's Gori. What? I'm not the one speaking. It's this lazy fellow. Come. - Hey.. Idiot! Hi. Idiot! Hi. So you were the one who was talking till now. - Yes. What's your name? - Raja. I'm the grandson of your grandma's grandpa. Oh, no.. Oh, you're from abroad, right? No, I'm from around here. Hey, don't.. Can we be friends? Yes, friends.. Do you know magic? - Yes. Please, show us some tricks. Even we can do that. - Oh, my God! What! - Huh? Go.. Hey.. It fell into my pocket. With this single plum.. - Wow! There are two plums now. How did this happen? Hey! Wow! Super! Hey! Nice.. Leave all that. Can you imitate the sound of my puppy? Not only the sound of your puppy I can make the sound of any puppy. Then imitate the sound of Bin Laden's puppy. He has made himself at home. - He likes kids. Hey, what's all this? How come he knows these many tricks? Did he really study MBA? - You know.. - Well.. Even I doubt that now. Did he learn MBA or MBM? - Dad! What's MBM? - What? Master of Black Magic. He's always like this. He dances, sings, performs magic ventriloquism, mimicry.. But he doesn't know one thing. What's that, Brother-in-law? Cooking. - Dad! I cooked breakfast and lunch for 15 years.. Okay.. He's a good cook too. - Don't underestimate him. Even if he doesn't get a job he will live somehow with his tricks. Better you arrange a show of his. We're ready to watch it. So he doesn't want to do a job. I'm not interested. If you want, you may proceed. Hey, I was just joking, right? What's all the fuss about? What's happening here? Let's go. Father-in-law is here. - Go inside.. - Let's go inside. Grandpa! I thought his dad was a trickster. But his son is worse than him. "I'm half man, half God. A mixture of both." Hey.. God will give everything to the bad guys. But he'll abandon them. He will test the good guys a lot. But he'll not abandon them. Yes.. Hey, what's that sound? What did you do? 'He is notorious.' Hey.. - Hey, no.. Your dad's habit! - No, my grandpa's habit! What's your name? - Raja. Krishnamoorthy. That's my name. That's my name too. He didn't love his family. Why did he want my name? You don't consider us as family. You don't consider us as family. Be grateful that I was named after you. That's why we came back. - 'I dug my own grave.' So what? I can never forget the past. But I'm new here, Grandpa. Can't you forget everything for me? Oh, shit! I had brought you a gift. I forgot to give you. What's this? Is it a walking stick? Yes, a strong one for you. I had told the dumbos many times to buy something like this when they go to town. No one obeyed me. Now you have bought this for me even though I didn't ask you. I'm really happy, dear. Now, why do I need this old one? Look, Grandpa. You forgot about the old one when you got a new one. Likewise, forget the past and forgive my dad. Okay? This is made of wood. We can throw it out whenever we want. But your dad has hurt me deeply. I can't easily forget it. So, it's been many years So, it's been many years since I forgot about him. Please, Grandpa. Can't you give him some love for me? Why some? I live to be with you. Come, dear. Come. Come on. Do you know how many gifts I have bought for you? I got to know that I had a grandson five months after you were born. From that day onwards I was waiting for you to come here. Check this out. I bought this when you turned one year old. Two years, three years, four years.. I never forgot to buy gifts for you when I bought one for my other grandchildren. My instincts came true. I expected you to come back one day and you did. Dear, wait.. I had bought this for you. Silk clothing. Did you like it? It's beautiful, Grandpa. This is for me. What's there for dad? I won't talk to you if you keep talking about him. Mind it. Grandpa, that's not what.. No, Grandpa. I was asking you about your long moustache. I oil my moustache. - You oil it! Hey, dear. What are you looking at? Is he a director from Hollywood? Yes. He had set off to America. But wandered around for a while before settling here. - Oh. Hey, everyone else becomes a director by making a movie. He became one without making a movie. Wait there. He is a great person. Let's go meet him. Come, let's see. Go inside. Hi, 'Ship.' - What? Do I look like a ship? Call me uncle. Rajan, this is your cousin. - Oh. The director, who is actually a terror.

Note, half an inch for his eyes. - Oh, God! - Stop.. Note, three inches for his ears. Shoulders, one and a half. Hands, two and a half.

Like you. Why are you interrupting an artist-director conversation? Nonsense. Hey, note, mouth one and a half inches. You've been measuring a lot of things. But why my mouth?

Do they look like they were bought from a local market? - Yes. Posters. - Yes.. Sir, I don't just have movies in my mind. My mind is much bigger than that. - It sounds like a tsunami! To be honest, I am a book of knowledge. If you open that, you'd see.. - That it has been dilapidated. Sir, from that book, you can know everything that you don't know. In short, I am a godown of knowledge. And this family is trying to set that godown on fire, sir. This moron too. He carries a matchbox for it too. Sir? Mr. Ship.. What should I call this gentleman? - Brother. No. He's my cousin, fool. Cousin, what have you brought for me from abroad? Cousin. Would you listen to me? - Yes. If you'd speak less.. Or..

I was not hurt when you called me crazy in front of those people. But I got hurt when you said you didn't know me. What did I ever do to you? Why are you pretending not to listen when I'm talking to you? What is it? Won't you talk to me? Can't you hear me? Say something. - Give me a break! Hey! Get lost! No matter how angry you are, I am still your grandpa. Did you think I'll run behind you if you stopped talking to me? One day.. Not any day. Today itself. Right now! You'll talk to me. What did you think about me? Even the Englishmen are scared of me! Hey! Won't you talk? Won't you talk to me? Hey, I am this happy only after you came. I can't bear it if you stop talking to me even if for a while. Hey! When you stop talking I feel like.. - Yes? It hurts, doesn't it? Your heart burns if you don't talk to me for half an hour, isn't it? We only have two weeks of bonding. It's been 20 years.. He came back because he wanted to talk to you. Aren't you ignoring him every time? I know how much he is hurting inside. What he did was wrong, wasn't it? - What you did was wrong too. Didn't he come back forgetting everything? Are you justifying him? - Okay. Tell dad that you have forgiven him. That won't happen. Then, we will leave. Hey, I thought at least you would stand by my side till the end. You have shown your father's nature after asking me to forget the past! You have shown your father's nature after asking me to forget the past! Get lost. You can leave. You'll hear the news of my death soon. I won't come even then. I'm not able to forget the past. My father is old news because I'm here. If I leave, you can talk to my father, isn't it? Okay. I'll leave. Hey! Are you threatening me? No, Grandpa. I don't know any other way to make you talk to each other. You should talk to each other, even if I'm not here. Hey! Raja fell! Oh, no! Raja fell down! You got stunned for a moment, didn't you? Stunned? My heart stopped for a moment. Come up first. - No, I won't. Oh, God! Hey, come up, dear. - I'll come if you agree to talk. I'll talk. Come up now. Promise? - Yes, promise. One moment. Oh, God! Grandpa, give me your hand. I'm scared. - Be careful.. Oh, my God! Hey, I couldn't love my son the way you love your father. So, will you talk? - Okay. Come up. Good. If you had told this.. Oh, God! Your son.. Go and talk to him. Go and talk to him, Grandpa. Go. Grandpa, I love you. Go.. Well.. I'm not here to argue about who is right and wrong. You have been treating me like an enemy since I came here. You have been treating me like an enemy since I came here. You might have the right to be mad at me. But he doesn't know that. I am the only one he had for the last 20 years. Since he came here and saw all of you he is happy. He is living. He is enjoying. You could act like you are happy at least for him. I am leaving. That's all. Okay. Shanmugham. Dad. Have you eaten anything yet? No, Dad. I haven't. - Didn't you? It's almost 1 o'clock. What are they all doing here? Yes. Come. Come on. - Yes. Come. - Yes. Eat up. - Sit down. Sit down. - Come.. - Sit down, Brother-in-law. Hey! Both of you, get up! - Father-in-law!

No.. - We have some dignity, too. We won't eat anything else from here. - Yes. - Come on. Let's go upstairs. - Yes. - Take some more. - Get lost! Thamara! - We can eat from there. - Yes. - Come here. Where is everyone else? Call them! Okay, Grandpa. - Dad, don't.. - Just sit there and eat! Come on, quick. Don't saunter. - What is it, Dad? What? - He has three sisters. Did you serve him breakfast yet? Shanmugham, what is dad saying? Why are you just standing there? Didn't you hear me? Bring him the food he wants. Yes. Go on. Go! - He always eats this late. - Come on. Bring the food! Yes. Come on. Yes. Come on, quick. Here. Yes. Are you done? You can go now. - No, Dad. We will serve it to him. - Didn't you hear what I said? Grandpa, I will serve.. - I can serve it to my son. You may leave! Come on. Let's go. Enough, Dad. - Eat some more, Son. - Enough. Aren't you going to eat? - I will eat later. What? - There is no fan. Hey! Why are you just standing there? Bring him a hand fan! Come on, you fool! Make it quick! Yes. Go on! Here. - No, Dad. I am full. What is this? I told you to bring a fan. - Okay. Sorry. What? - Okay. - Really? Director. - Grandpa? - Your movie isn't happening. - Yes. At least take a photo of us. Come on. - Grandpa! Thanks for at least letting me take a photo. - Come on. Hey! All the Hollywood movies are sad nowadays. - Really? Hey! All the Hollywood movies are sad nowadays. - Really? Wasn't there a new Titanic movie in 3D? - Yes. They could have made it a little better. - Yes. - What? Hey! Why is he torturing me like this? Director. - Yes. - Do you know why he is doing this? - Why? He wants a role in your movie. - How do you know that? Don't you know anything, sir! - What? Do you know how Mr. Rajini got a role from Director Balachandran? He took a cigarette and lit it up in style. That's what is happening here. - Yes. - Really? - Yes. Really? - Yes. - I didn't know. Do you have a matchbox? No! - Okay. Tell him that we will give him a chance.. - Yes. ...and get his matchbox. - Okay. Hello. - What? - The director.. - Who? That idiot wants to borrow your matchbox. Okay. - Thank you. What? - He said he would, if it's to burn you. Did he really say that? - He said something else, too. That was.. Hey! I knew this would happen if I send an idiot like you. A decent guy like me should ask him for it. Watch me. Go and get it all. Please, Cousin. - What? - Please. Here. Stupid! I didn't mean your finger. I want fire. Here. - Thanks. - Okay. Do you see this? Oh, God! Thanks. I will see you later. Is this him? Didn't you say that you had a photo of both of you? This is your father. The nose. He has the same nose. Just like me. But the cheeks and forehead are not like mine. You are like your mother. But you have the heart of your father. Moorthy was a good man, dear. Can I keep this photo? - Yes. Thanks. Hey, wait! What is it? You look more beautiful today. You look happy. Hey! Fine.. Your eyes are like butterflies. Your face is shining. You are happy. So the cow must have given birth. - What? Did any of your prayers come true? - No. No? Hey! What is this? Hey! - Give it to me! - Why do you have my father's photo? - Come on. Give it to me! That is my father with him. Okay. Is that why you are this happy? Yes. - All right. You have never seen your father, right? - No. - Take a good look. Be careful. - Why? - If those kids see you.. - What? ...they will be scared. My father is more handsome than yours. - Hey, Thamara! My father is more handsome than yours. - Hey, Thamara! Thamara! Thanks. - What is this? - For showing me my father. Thanks. Thanks. She was thanking me for giving her father's photo. My God! She is just amazing. I have been watching her since we got here. She works here day and night. She looks after everyone. She is the perfect girl. I am sure that she will take good care of her husband's family. Her in-laws are lucky indeed. That is, her husband will be a very lucky guy. 'Wake up to this heartbeat of mine.' The pulse won't stop even if you stop this. Do.. You.. Do you.. Like me.. Like this.. Do you like me? Like this. Do you like me like this? Like this? Like this. Like what? I was asking you to hold it like that. She is right! Coffee. You can take the glass back. - Yes. Do you like me.. Like this? Do you like me like this? 'Raja.'

I would be quoting Santhosh Pandit if I say 'not to catch a flying bird with a ladder.' If I ask for apologies, I would be quoting Achuthanandan. I would be mocking Sharreth if I say that 'it isn't good.' I would be mocking Sharreth if I say that 'it isn't good.' Dude, give me one dialogue that I can write today. Say something, dude! Don't stare at me like an imbecile. Am I going to make a movie on mutes? Rascal! Get lost! Don't show me your face again. Scoundrel! Why is he sitting here? Has he started writing stories? Maybe. If the story is good enough, I'll fish it out of him. Excuse me, Cousin. What are you thinking? Cigarette? Cigarette? Oh, no.. I have quit smoking to start drinking. Don't you want a story? - Story! Yes, Cousin. If you have a family themed story tell me. Bring it on.. I will tell the story. A beautiful village. A loving father. A son who loves his father more than anything. An unusual friendship between the two of them. Why didn't you tell me that uncle had such a serious problem? I kept it hidden until now. I can't anymore. That's why I shared it with you. He has got two or three months left. After that, my dad.. I am training myself to live the rest of my life alone. Cousin, let no one else know this secret. Okay? No, you can't keep this secret. Promise me. Cousin.. I won't tell, Cousin. - Thanks. Cousin, we have everybody at home. Your father will be happy to see you getting married. Shall I ask my mom to search a girl for you? It's already fixed. Already fixed? - A girl chosen by my father. Who is that, Cousin? - Thamara. Thamara? Really? She is really good. I will go home now itself and make the necessary arrangements for your marriage. - No. I love her. But I don't know whether she loves me. If everybody tries to convince her for marriage and if she rejects I won't be able to gift my dad a good daughter-in-law. I am trying my level best to fulfil his wish. I am ready to wait my whole life for her love. I am ready to wait my whole life for her love. But until then, my dad.. Everybody loves God. The same God feels like taking my father along. That's the reason God is calling him back quickly. Cousin, when you were born, there were many to take care of you like father, mother, grandfather, aunt and uncle. Isn't it? But I didn't have.. From the time I was born, the one who fed me sung for me, comforted me and fed me was my dad. I need him badly. Cousin, I thought you were going to narrate some story. But you narrated our family story and made me cry. I never expected it. Raja.. Astrologer, you mentioned about Shanmugham's assets and reputation. But you didn't say anything about his life. Astrologer, what does Shanmugham's horoscope say? Astrologer, what does Shanmugham's horoscope say? Shanmugham will be alive until 90 years old. The change in his stars is favourable. The moon is at its peak and it indicates a long life. Here it is. Son, pay the astrologer's fees yourself. Yes! 'Shanmugham will be alive until 90 years old.' 'Long live, Shanmugham.' Sreeni.. Do you mean to say that my son cannot be saved? No. No. I don't.. I don't believe this. He is.. He is all right. He doesn't have any disease. Science can never be wrong. - That means you are wrong. Isn't it? How did you diagnose his disease? How did you do that? He donated blood for you. We normally test the donor's blood. We identified an undefined cell in his blood. When cultured, it was confirmed as MS. I mean, Multiple Sclerosis. - He is young. He is still a kid. I need my son. I need him. You may do whatever you wish. - There is no cure for his disease. It usually affects one in a lakh in cold countries. I don't know how it affected him particularly. What shall I do? What am I supposed to do? I won't have anybody now. I don't have anybody dear to me. Listen, he only has 60 days more to live. He should be happy for the next 60 days. Take him to meet your family. Take him to meet your family. But he should be unaware of it until the end. Come on, Sreeni. Come on. It's not a child's play. You know, he is intelligent. What will we do if he comes to know about this? You needn't worry about that. It's the peculiarity of this disease. The disease will never show any symptoms. Both the patient and the people around him will be unaware of it. No. You are giving the wrong advice. I am not an actor. I will be shattered. How will I.. I raised him without exposing him to the difficulties of life. I had always seen him happy. The remaining days.. I want to ensure his happiness in his remaining days too. I can't bear it. Sreeni.. Let's do something. Shall we tell him that I am the patient and to keep me happy? If so? He will surely make me happy and I, in turn, can see him happy. Let us make him believe this for at least a few days. Please. Don't be foolish. - I am mad thinking about his life. Listen to me. Please help me keep this a secret. I know it's against your ethics. But you must tell this lie. I don't find any other solution to control me, Sreeni. Please.. Please! Okay. You must give him certain medicines without his knowledge. Thank God. Thank you. Hello, Dad. It might be the rain of happiness. It might be the rain of happiness. Yes! Those are the tears of the sky. - Why is the sky crying? The clouds may be sad. - That is possible. Dad, listen to this joke. Lord Ayyappan gets missed calls from a number regularly. When he called back, it was Lord Padmanabha from Trivandrum. He said that he didn't have balance to call and that his wealth was confiscated. He advised Lord Ayyappan to hide his wealth and that the cellars of Sabarimala would be raided soon. Here is another joke. There was a dead body in front of the police station. Dad. I'm Tom's fan. - I'm Jerry's fan. That is funny, right? Oh no, it's a power cut. The electricity department is to be blamed. 'I'm scared, Dad.' 'Of this silence.' What are you doing? The electricity will be back anytime. Shut up. You should obey me. High voltage could kill you. Look at this. Hello. Anybody home? What? Oh, no.. - It's a power cut. That's all. Sorry.. - Oh, no.. Oh, no. - Please come out! Oh, no! My arm is stuck! - I'm scared.. Come here.. Oh, no! My arm is stuck! - I'm scared.. Come here.. Oh, no! - Oh, God! Oops. What? Show us. Your act is superb. That's enough. "It's a long time since you.." "In the moonlight." - What? Hi. - What do you want now? Don't you know what I want? - Tell me something else. Okay. What is 'Pappukodu'? - What? What does 'Pappukodu' mean? - 'Pappukodu'? Weren't you playing with the kids saying 'Pappukodu'? You said 'one for father, one for mother' and so on. And even one for the dog. As you gave one for the dog, can't you give me one too? - No. Then, tell me. - What? - That you love me. I'm sorry.. You can't say, right? That's because your hands are not free. I will help you. I.. - Yes. Love.. - Yes. - You.. Thanks. I like you. For what? - For saying that you love me. I never said that. - You are lying. You should keep your word. You are very.. I'm so happy.. - I never said it.. - My God! I'm happy. - I never said it. - I'm happy. I never said that. - Don't forget me. I will come for you. Somebody, please.. Thank you. - It was good. - Uncle, once more, please. The show is over! Out.. It was.. Oh, my God! It was a great show. From now on, they would call you Uncle Joker. From now on, they would call you Uncle Joker. Uncle Joker? - Why didn't you show us these acts all this time? 'All these are for you.' Okay.. Hey, Raja. What are you doing? Are you playing with him? Why are you dressed like this? Joker. That's enough. Everybody is waiting for you at the table. That's enough. Go downstairs now. He is funny. Do you still consider him a child? We have to think about getting him married. We want to attend his wedding since we couldn't attend yours. We want to attend his wedding since we couldn't attend yours. Sister, your intention is good. But we have to get him a girl he likes. Do you know why I came here? To talk to you privately. I have a lot to talk about. It's not necessary that you talk. This is my heart. That is my true love. What are you doing to my heart? Are you burning it? Oh, no! You can burn it. - Water is here. - It's ash now. Oh, no.. Give it to me. I will pour it. - I will do it. - I'll do it. - I will. Do you need any help? - No.. I'll do it. Why are you drinking water just after taking a bath? Because my son just had his lunch. I will smack you. Stop there. Don't make me run. Stop there. Like father like son. "When my heart will go on" "and go on and go.." Thamara. Won't you talk to me? You don't have to talk a lot. Just keep replying to me. Move. I need to go and wash clothes. No, I won't. One moment. Tell me something. Are you scared to fall in love? Okay, we'll marry first. After that, whenever you want, we can fall in love, okay? How is the deal? Are you still confused? You won't understand my urgency. All you care about is visiting the temple and doing the daily rituals, isn't it? Temple.. Temple.. God! Thamara, one moment. I love you. Do you love me? The tailor didn't do his work properly. Did you like it? - I didn't like this. So you like me. - I hate everything you do. Don't you like me? - I hate English. What about Chinese, Russian, Japanese? I will talk to you in whichever language you like. Hey! It's me, Sreeni. Yes, tell me. - How is he doing? He is fine. We are giving him his daily medication. I hope he's happy. - In fact, he is keeping me happy. Listen to me. It's been one month. He is in the first stage of his illness. He might feel headache, body pain and nervous weakness. One more thing. He might slowly lose his perception of colours. He might visualise black as white. He might get blind spots. You need to make sure that he is always happy. Make sure of it. - Okay, I will take care. Make sure of it. - Okay, I will take care. You must be calm and composed. I am doing some tests to know more about this illness. I am trying my level best. Okay? Take care. Bye. What are you doing here? - I am meditating. What do you have in your mind? - Only you. Please go outside. - Then, I won't be able to talk to you. Please, no.. Hello. Thamara, what's all that commotion? Oh, God! Grandpa. - What happened? Oh, God! Grandpa. - What happened? She is crying. - What happened? The bucket fell down. Really? I thought that you got scared seeing something. Come outside. What did he say? Hadn't I told you to go out? Please, leave. Should I stay or leave? - Stay. Should I stay or leave? - Okay, then leave. Let everyone know. I will kill myself if that happens. - What is your problem? Has everybody arrived? Let's go. - You are killing me day by day. Have you ever shown any affection towards me? Thamara. Let's forget everything. I am not asking you to marry me. At least, you should become my dad's daughter-in-law. Okay? What is this? Nice? - What is this? When I tore your dress yesterday.. Leave all that. This is not just a sari. It's my heart This is not just a sari. It's my heart If you wear this, I will think that you have accepted my love. Wear it. If you don't wear it, I.. I'll have no other option. - Stop. Shucks! You can take this back. I am asking you to take this and leave. - Damn it! Give me a break. Are you so resolute not to wear it? You are making me scared. Please leave before anyone comes here. - Hey! I don't have the habit of taking back my gifts. Listen! I won't leave this place without conquering your heart. Did you get scared.. Oh, my God! Really? I was just trying to scare you and I succeeded. Please wear it. Are you okay? I am sorry. Do wear it. You must not cry. Okay.. Oh, my God. 'He might slowly lose' 'his perception of colours.' Please blow it up carefully. There was a total of ten balloons. You popped nine of them. Now we are left with only one. Be careful. Be careful. This is our last chance. Even I am in a similar situation. Did you too give her balloon? Yes. On the first day I met her. Yes. On the first day I met her. What? You should have blown it for him. If you don't use it, it might get ruined. Now you will ask me for this balloon. How did you know? Give it to me. - I won't give it so easily. Sorry. Here, take a gum. I need money. - Money? Okay, I will give it. Take Rs. 5. - I need Rs. 50. - Rs. 50? Rs. 100. - It's just a balloon, not gold. Rs. 150. - That's enough. She is more crooked than the Marwaris. - Make it fast. It's the price of her breath. - It happened to be my need. Take Rs. 150. - I should have charged you more. Such a mischievous girl. He is such an idiot to pay Rs. 150 for a single balloon. I don't understand. When I grow up.. - Okay Even my room would be filled with balloons. When you come and ask for it.. When you come and ask for it.. I won't give you the balloon blown by me. Did you understand? Such an idiot. So much maturity at such a young age! "Dear, don't leave me.." "Dear, don't leave me.." "Don't leave me.. After stealing my heart." "Don't be so cruel.. By leaving me alone." "Don't leave me.. After stealing my heart." "Don't be so cruel.. By leaving me alone." "Cinderella.. Oh, Cinderella!" "You are.. The rhythm of love." "Cinderella.. Oh, Cinderella!" "You are.. The rhythm of love." "Dear, don't leave me.." "The rainbow embellished the sky" "and painted the moon a shade of crimson." "Let's explore the sky." "I will create a garden in the desert for you." "I can describe your beauty poetically." "I will even make the people sing chorus with us." "You have gone crazy." "Hey! You, get lost.." "Cinderella.. Oh, Cinderella!" "You are.. The rhythm of love." "Cinderella.. Oh, Cinderella!" "You are.. The rhythm of love." "Dear, don't leave me.." "I will slowly caress you as a breeze." "I will shower on you as a rain of love." "I want to be your hero." "Be the colours of my life, darling." "Can you be my girl forever?" "Can you be my girl forever?" "I am ready to die for your love." "Are you really insane?" "Hey! You. Get lost." "Cinderella.. Oh, Cinderella!" "You are.. The rhythm of love." "Cinderella.. Oh, Cinderella!" "You are.. The rhythm of love." "Dear, don't leave me.." Hey! What is this? - Hey.. - Why did you bring me here? You said it would help in doing my work, but it is not. Keep quiet, sir. Scriptwriters of hit movies come to such places for creative ideas. If you simply sit idle in a room If you simply sit idle in a room ideas won't come to you. Come out of that room and explore the surroundings. Only then will you get new ideas. That means you guys are useless. Isn't it? - He is a useless fellow. Look at him. He looks like a loafer. I should be whacked for hiring you guys. - Whack him! Whack him right now! To hell with his dialogue! He is a mechanic, it seems! Okay, take your tool. It's right below the bench.. - What! Did you find it? Take it. Fasten the screw. Tighten it up well. Ask Ramaswamy to help you. Okay, continue to do it.. Turn it on now. Yes, okay. He is taking too long to repair a vehicle! Okay.

Even these guys have music in their heart. Music is present even in you. Make it clear, sir. Don't you understand? - My God! Why did you harm me? - Did you listen to a sound now? Yes. - Even that has a rhythm. My God! - Did you listen to that? My God! - Did you listen to that? Even that has a rhythm. My God! - Didn't you listen to a different rhythm now?

There was a study on Raja's disease at the Regional Research Institute. Is it true? I contacted the doctor and fixed an appointment for Raja. God is great. Okay, what do you want me to do now? What should I do? - I have sent you the tickets. You must come here at the earliest. Why are you silent? There is no harm in trying to see if it works. Okay, I will try. That's good. Call me when you get the tickets. - Okay. Yes. Raja.. Hey, Raja. Son, please be careful. Didn't I tell you? Are you okay? Hey, come on.. Get up. Get up, my dear. Why are you being childish? It's lucky you didn't get hurt. I think you are fed up with this village life. I think this is the time to go back. Murali called me and said he can't manage the work by himself.. You have to be there to sign the new contract. Before I could say anything he booked the tickets for us. I think we will have to go back. Come. We should sell the business and live here. - What did you say? We should sell the business and live here. - What do you mean? We should sell the business and live here. - What do you mean? We came here to meet everyone. Now we have to go back. There is nothing more here. We can't explain it through words or drawings. We have to feel it on our own, Dad. Sreeni, the tickets are here. But I'm not sure if we are coming. What do you mean? I have a dilemma as to what reason to tell the relatives and Raja to let me leave the house. You have to come up with some reason to leave the house. You might miss the appointment. You might miss the appointment. Sorry, you shouldn't miss the appointment. You have to make it here somehow.

Stop. - Yes.. Come.. - Stop there. I will catch you. - No. You can't catch me.. - Stop there.. Stop there. - Come on.. You can't escape. - You can't catch me. You can't escape. - You can't catch me.

Black and white everywhere! Green. - Uncle, this is not green. This is bud rose. - Where are you, dear? Yes, Mom. - Come down. - Yes, Mom. - Come. - Uncle, you are out. Out. Shanmugham, why are you not attending my calls? Where did you go leaving your phone? - Why are you so angry? Are you at least as concerned as me? Did you get your relatives to agree? What? Then, forget about them. Have you convinced Raja? - Yes.. Have you convinced Raja? - Yes.. Hey, Shanmugham. We don't have any time to waste. Raja is at a crucial stage. His disease would have started spreading now. He is almost reaching his final stage. He is nearing death day by day. With God's grace, he is unaware of his disease till now. But be careful. He keeps getting frequent headaches. And sudden discolouration in sight. - That's right. There will be blind spots. It can cause nervous instability. Hey! I have been telling you the same thing again and again. Once he starts experiencing this discolouration all our secrets will get disclosed. Somehow, get him here. Hey, Shanmugham. Don't you know his attachment towards me? If he gets to know that I was lying to him till now how will I ever face him? Hereafter, every single minute is crucial for him. Okay, see you. My patients are waiting. I will keep in touch. You should call me. I will take care of everything. Hey, be cool. Don't get tensed. Hey, be cool. Don't get tensed. Bye! - Bye. Thanks. Dad! Dad. Dad.. I am so happy to hear that you are totally fine. I am so happy! I am really happy for you. But when you got to know about my illness you would have got really upset, right? My dear Shanmugham! You just mimicked my illness and gave me your sorrow and told me to make you happy. My happiness was a relief to you, right? Scoundrel! That was a good game, Dad. A match-fixing between a father and a son. But how could you do this, Shanmugham? With all the grief, how could you smile at all my pranks and plays? I am not scared to die. I am not scared to die. But how will you tolerate my separation, Dad? That thought upsets me. In our next birth, let us exchange our relation. Okay? I want you to be my son. And I want to stay alive. All right? Okay. You did not want me to know about this, right? Okay. Let that remain as such until the end. All right? I promise you. Hey, Rocky! - Hey! - Be careful. - Bye. Hey, what happened? Your eyes are reddened. Something had fallen into my eyes. Hey, wait. Which eyes? Show me. Is it fine now? It is still inside, Dad. - Hey, wait.. Open your eyes. Are you fine now? - Thanks. Okay, go.. I had kept my phone for charging. I am the little devil! Hey! Run.. - Run fast.. He'll catch us! - Run.. - He is the real devil! Hi, Cousin! - Hello! You look happy. - Yes! Actually, I have got a new climax for my story. - Is it? The doctor examined the father and said that he was fine. How is it? - Really? Superb! Hey, I have a better climax. - What is that? Tell me.. The son is ill and not the father. How about this climax? - What? You? - Yes. Isn't it better? Cousin! - Hey! Take it easy. I liked this climax. Hey, nobody should get to know this. Promise me. Thanks. - Hey! - Yes? Then what about your love? - It's gone.. That love is gone! Yes! Right, left.. - It's gone! - Right, left.. - Right, left.. - Right.. - Left, right, left.. - Right, left.. - Right.. - Left, right, left.. - Right, left.. Right, left, right, left.. "Whatever happened was unexpected." - 'Ananda Vikatan.' "What was expected never happened." "What was expected never happened." "Whatever happened was unexpected." "I have none to support me." "Not even a mother." "Not even a mother." "By the time my enjoyable days began" "my life is on the verge of getting over." "These colourful flowers" "will adorn me after my death." "Is this just?" "Is this my fate?" "Oh, God! Why did you give me this life?" "Whatever happened was unexpected." "What was expected never happened." "What was expected never happened." "Whatever happened was unexpected." Do you love Raja? You are yet to say this to him, aren't you? The peace and happiness of this family was lost because of love around 25 years back. We returned and brought the happiness back. We returned and brought the happiness back. We celebrated all these days like a festival. We'll return tomorrow. I don't want to spoil the happiness.. Hey! - Are you against love? Never! I am not against love. We came to bring back the happiness and we did it. You should happily see us off tomorrow. That is what I need. For you, it's your family. But for me, it's a sanctum. I'm just a servant. As I am obliged to this family I have hidden all my feelings till now. But this was beyond my control.. That is love. Real love will succeed once. I understood what you said. Have a safe journey. - Okay. Thanks. Sir. - Yes. Sir. - Yes. Will you come back for sure even if it's late? Yes, surely we will come back. Not for my family but to take you with us. Sorry, dear. Dad. - What is it? Are you still interested to drench in the rain? Just leave it, Dad. I hate this place. Just leave it, Dad. I hate this place. It's really a dry land. Muddy roads, bullock carts and that tree. What is it? Palm tree. - Yes, palm tree. There are ponds here and there. But the water is not fresh. So boring, Dad. Shall we return to Hong Kong? Colourful life, pretty girls disco tracks, fast cars. - No.. No. - Dad, I miss that. - No. We are not going. Dad is happy and he forgave me. He has become old. Let him be happy. Even if we want to go, he won't let us go. I can't even talk to him about it. Dad, I can talk to grandpa. - No. Please try to understand me. - I said, no need. Okay. If you're okay with it, even I am okay. Okay. What does it mean? Are you ready to stay here or to go back? Dad! Yes! Wow! Hey! Wow! Sorry, Dad. You were trying to take me back. Weren't you? Did you bring the coconuts inside? Keep it in the store room. Dad. - Okay, come. I was waiting to talk to you. I gave the details of our assets yesterday. I gave the details of our assets yesterday. They will prepare the document today. - Okay. If you and Raja come to registrar's office tomorrow and sign the documents, the formalities will be over. - Dad, but.. Don't worry. I have divided the assets in the right way. I.. Not that.. - I am following the path of my ancestors. Do you want anything more? - We.. I wish to return. But you came back after a trip recently. I.. Not that, Dad. We are planning to return to Hong Kong. Are you going abroad? Do you want to return abroad? Is it your native place? Don't you like to stay with your family? Or do you want to be away from us? My business is established there. I thought of settling it. - Hey! So you are here to cheat me purposefully, aren't you? I thought you wished to stay with us forever. I thought you wished to stay with us forever. Only now did I understand your intention. Is this a motel? Dad, we are planning to come back after settling it all. You! If you try to cheat me anymore I won't spare you.. Son, you needn't fulfil your duties as a son. But please leave your son here to stay with me. I am begging you. Dad, why are you saying so? Please don't hurt me with such words. Bye, Grandpa. Hey, did you see this.. He is at least ready to bid adieu. But Raja is all set to go back. They value money more than relations. For them, money matters more. Hey! - Sister. - We are rich enough for our future generations to lead a luxurious life. There is no need for you to sacrifice your life to earn money. There is no need for you to sacrifice your life to earn money. We are filthy rich. To hell with your business! Please, listen to me first. I said I will be back. I am not leaving you forever. My business is all there. Let me dispose of it. - What's it? You eloped and got married. They wish to see your son's marriage at least. But it can be conducted even after that. - You.. You are the same stubborn fellow even now. You can go if you want. Let him stay here. Aunt, my books and certificates are all there. Let me take care of it. I'll return.. - Yes, you are his son. So you would be stubborn like him. If you want to go, just go. Go! - Hey! Aunt! - Hey! Sister. - Listen! - Hey! - He came after 25 years.. Don't try to create issues unnecessarily. - What? - Dad! Dad, please. Am I creating issues? - Yes. You are purposefully.. - Don't try to blame me.. You are not bothered about us. - Sister. - Tell her to shut up. I'm losing my temper. - What the hell.. I may become angry. - Brother! Whatever you.. - Grandpa. Just stop it! - Hey! I don't want anyone to fight here anymore. I don't even know for how long I will be alive. If you have your own priorities.. No more explanations. - ...I'm happy for it. - Dad. I can stop you from going back. But I can't stop your son from going back. Go happily. If you don't return, I will wait for your arrival till my last breath. - Grandpa! Try to come for my cremation. - Why are you saying all these? I told you that we'll be back. We will be back. We'll be with you until your last breath. Hey! Dad. - Yes. Promise! - This is enough for me, dear. What is it, Grandpa? This is my chain of life. Our ancestors lived up to 100 years by wearing this necklace. Why do I need this? Aren't you the traveller? You board many flights. Let this guard you. Thank you. Thank you, Sister. For getting me the permission. Hey, I just presented your idea. But I feel like I overdid it. Sorry. - It's okay. Many people anticipate your return. I agreed because of your business, you kid's education and certificates. Okay.. Go on, finish your affairs and come back soon. Hey, there! Naughty! Should you go? Should you go? Yes, sir. So you won't listen to me? - Sorry, ma'am. Who listens to old ladies nowadays! Old lady, you! Yes! - Show us a trick! Shall I drop her? - Yes.. - Yes.. I'll drop her here. Oh, no! Magic. Hey! One second.. Wait.. Wait! Wait.. A minute.. Go and say goodbye. I'll come. Okay.. - Bye.. - Okay.. Bye. Bless us, Grandpa. - Raja, my boy. Come back quickly. I want that. - Come back soon. - Dad. We'll be on our way. - I'm not done seeing you. I forgot something. My dear! Bye. Cousin.. Hey, Cousin. We're leaving. Bye. Take care. What happened to the story? Did you finalise it? It's completed. The character named Raja is going back. But he returns soon. He joins everyone and marries his beloved. He has a lot of kids and after their marriage, they have kids and he becomes a grandfather. After that he sits over there and celebrates 'Diwali'. The story begins from there. How is it? Cousin, there's another important thing. I have a good title too. Shall I tell you? Yes. - King! Hi! - Hey! Hey, you! Breath. I have no change. That's not needed. She gave this to give to you. Promise! Have you forgotten everything? Bye. 'This is not just a sari.' 'It's my heart.' 'If you wear this, I will think that you have accepted my love.' No matter how many days, I will wait until you come back. I'll be back. Bye, everyone. We're going. Come back soon. - Bye, Brother-in-law. Sister. - Bye. Little ones! Bye. Dad! - Bye. - Dad! Let this car remain here. When we come back, it will be useful. He is correct. The vehicle will remind us of him. Velu! - Yes? - Shift the luggage to the other car. Velu! - Yes? - Shift the luggage to the other car. What you intend to do will go perfecty. After that, come back soon, dear! Sure, Dad. Sugunan, take care of dad. - Okay.. Bye, little ones.
