THE LAST WITNESS The year 1980 is a time when old evils are being cleared away and new order is being established. I want to talk candidly about the truth and lies of the past through a detective who devoted himself to protecting humanity. Both the story and the scenes are dark. I hope such darkness would be gone in the 1980s. Director Yi Doo-yong Who are you?

Produced by Kim Hwasik Directed by Yi Dooyong Munchang Police Station You are the only one with a college degree not only in here but also in all other stations of our county. So why weren't you assigned to any position yet? Because I'm incompetent I guess. Too much modesty is not a virtue! Remember last year's Yongwangri reservoir case? I called you in because of that case. You mean the murder of the brewer? Right. I think you can solve the case. Why would you pick someone incompetent like me... People always have someone whom they want to ask for help when they're in trouble. -I don't think I can -Don't say no. I'm retiring next year. I've worked for the police for 30 years but I haven't done much. I should at least solve the cases in my jurisdiction before retiring. I want to end my career without leaving anything incomplete. Here is a gun and some money. Report back to me secretly. But you don't have to report everything. Hey. mister. Come in and have a drink! Come on. honey! Hey mister. have some fun in here. Our rooms are nice and warm. It's freezing cold! You're so pathetic! Get the hell out of my sight! You're always getting on my nerves. Stupid! I wish I didn't have a son like you. So pathetic! Sorry. You always drink alone. Ah. right. Maybe I should drink with you tonight. May I have a drink? Okay How is your business these days? It couldn't get any worse. If I had a couple of pretty girls I would have more customers. But I can't afford it. Yes. Making a living only gets harder. People kill even in places like this. You know the victim. Mr. Yang. It's not fair to talk about a dead man like this but... Anything to talk about him? He was not popular. Look. have you seen anyone who is sad because of his death? No. I haven't. Though everyone likes money Anyone as greedy as him is bound to be punished You're right. I sure am. And there was a fuss at his funeral. Fuss? About what? I guess I'm talking too much tonight. Who cares? It's just the two of us. Uh. we're out of liquor. Bring some more. No one knew that the woman he lived with was not his wife. The day he was killed. a woman showed up with her family and made a scene. She turned out to be his wife. They badly beat the woman Yang had lived with. It must have been awful. It sure was. They stayed for several days and created a ruckus . His wife is not from this town? No. she isn't. Do you know where she lives? Well. I don't remember... -Pungsan. -Huh? Damn I thought you were asleep. Don't interrupt our conversation. Either go out and make some money or study. Detective, he is my only child and I don't know what to do with him. Can't you get him a decent job? Have a nice day. Thanks. Hey. mister here is Pungsan. Wake up. I'm from the Munchang Police Station. I'm looking for Yang Dalsoo's family. Yang Dalsoo? I have no idea. Why don't you ask the villagers? You mean the dead man? I know him. He lived in this village. I heard his family still lives here. That's right. Where do they live? Go straight along the main street and you'll find a village called Hyodangri . Hyodangri? Yes. Ask anyone there. It'll be easy to find. Who are you? I'm with the police. Police? Honey. someone from the police is here What? The police? Is there something wrong? Are you Yang Jongtae? Yes. I am. You live with your mother Yi Boksoon. right? Yes. she is sick in bed right now. Why do you ask? Can we talk in her room? Hey. hey. I'm so sorry for your loss. How unfortunate I am! You guys haven't found the killer yet? No. That's why I came to see you. I need to know about Mr.Yang's background. Huh? You want to know what? You haven't found a clue yet. What on earth do you want to know? I heard you took his assets and things from Munchang May I see his things? There weren't anything special so I threw them all away. Anything will be okay. Let me take a look. You stupid! What do you take them out for? You know they make me sick. When did your father leave here for Munchang? About 20 years ago. Is this your father? Yes. Why did he leave Pungsan alone? He was crazy about a girl who was young enough to be his daughter. He deserves whatever he got. Lawyer Kim Ah.. Was he involved in any lawsuit? How would we know that? Can I keep this diary? Huh... Excuse me. Sure. go ahead. Where can I find the Seniors' Hall ? Go straight up this street. What do you want to know about Yang Dalsoo? I want to know what he did around here 20 years ago and why he left this village for Munchang. That's because of a girl. No. that was not just about the girl. As far as I know He made a fortune. That's why he left here. -Have some drink. -A fortune? Here are some food and drinks. Thank you. What do you mean? He made a fortune? During the Korean War he led the youth association of this village. There were a lot of communist guerrillas in the Jiri Mountain. He received a reward for capturing 13 guerrillas No kidding. Do you remember how much the reward was for one guerrilla? It was no more than the price of a sack of rice. So you can't say he made a fortune with that. Moreover. he captured just four not thirteen. Because the rest of them were killed in battle. Right. Hwang Bau and Han Dongju were not guerrillas. No. they weren't. You said four guerrillas surrendered. What happened to them? We have no idea. At that time there was a middleman between the guerrillas and the army. He probably knows about that well. Who is he? Jo lkhyun the principal of Pungsan Elementary School. I see. Thank you. Ah. my bag. I really appreciate your help. -Thank you. -Take care Talking of Yang Dalsoo reminds me of the Korean War. It's cold. You should go in. -Well... -What? Would you come again and see me later? -Why? -I have something to tell you. You do? Why not now? I pity Hwang Bau. I feel really sorry for him. This is just between you and me. Ok. I see. -Oh. My! -Excuse me. May I help you? I'd like to see Mr. Jo lkhyun the principal. -You know it is Sunday. -Sorry. What do you want to see him for? -What? -Does your child attend this school? Yes. that's right. I need to talk to him regarding my son. What grade is he in? -And what's his name? -Do I have to tell you that? I'm on duty so it's my job to write down things like that. Visitor's name purpose and... Then never mind. I'll come later Mr. Jo is not here. right? If you have to meet him I can help you. Why didn't you say that earlier? I'm busy. What's funny? -You're not a parent. are you? -Excuse me? Parents don't come to school on Sundays And they usually want to see the homeroom teacher not the principal. Yes. you are right. -I am from the police. -Wait. let me see that more closely. -What? -Because you don't look like a police officer -Take a look. -Thank you. You are a good-looking police officer. Please don't waste my time. Can you tell me where he lives? Draw me a map if you can. Ok. I will. Thank you Did Mr. Jo do something wrong? -No. -Then why do you want to see him? I have something to ask him -Is it important? -Yes. it's important. -But you can't meet him now. -What? He went to Gwangju on business. -Then why didn't you tell me earlier? -Because he is coming back this evening. Excuse me. -I'll probably see you again. -What are you doing here? This is my place. -Then what about Mr. Jo? -He is my uncle. Here comes the man I told you about. -Excuse me. -Have a seat. She told me about you. What do you want to see me for? You know Yang Dalsoo who was killed a few days ago? I heard that you helped him capture 13 guerrillas during the Korean War. Yes. I did Nine were killed and only four surrendered. I want to know where they are and how they are doing. Have some tea. -Kang Manho. -Who? Go and see Kang Manho and you can learn of everything. Hwangsan Station Can you tell me which way is Gupori? -It's on the hills over there. -Thank you. Hwangsan Post Office -How much is it? -Registered mail is 320 won. Is there something wrong? Why is the police looking for me? Kang Manho is your father. right? Yes. but... I have something to ask him. Ok. I see. A detective is here to see you. He wants to talk to you. How are you doing. Mr. Kang? You are from the police? I am sorry to bother you. Yang Dalsoo was murdered in Munchang. And while investigating. I learned that you and he had been close. So I thought I could get some information from you. -Can I have a cigarette? -Sure. But I don't think it's good for you. I am dying anyway so why quit smoking? But... So he died that way after all. His story goes way back to the Korean War. At that time I was a guerrilla hiding in the Jiri Mountain. -Comrade Kang Manho. where are you? -Here I am. The commander is looking for you. I am here. sir. -Are you okay? -Comrade Son Jihye. I am fine. I received an order from Pyeongyang. They ordered us to launch an all-out attack against the four counties surrounding this mountain and bring them under communist control. What a stupid order! Knowing we are in hopeless circumstances. they ordered us to make an extensive attack. There are a lot of treacherous men in Pyeongyang who are waiting for us to be wiped out. I will not follow this order. The commander Son Sukjin was from a large landowner family, but he was fascinated with communism. During the Korean War, he was appointed the commander of people's guerrilla unit hiding in the Jiri Mountain. He was somewhat eccentric. He even brought his only daughter with him when he moved into the mountain. I heard you were looking for me. sir. Well. I can feel that I am going to die soon. -What are you talking about? -I mean I know when I'll die. So I want to ask you to take care of my daughter if something happens to me. She is my only child. And I don't have anyone else to ask. Take this. I hid the fortune I inherited from my father somewhere in this mountain. And this map shows the way to the place. You are probably surprised to hear that an ardent communist like me would do such a thing just for his own good. Looking back on the past I feel I have been deceived by communists. I believed in the communist revolution. but I now realized that it doesn't make sense. So I'll do whatever it takes to save my daughter. And this is what I want to ask of you. Take it and go. I'll follow you later. They are looking for my father. We got an order from Pyeongyang to relieve you of the commander post and execute you by a firing squad. But as a new commander I think it's too dangerous. So we will stab you to death. A few days later the guerrillas were nearly wiped out. Get out of here! Hurry up! Follow me! Damn it! Move forward! Only 13 people managed to survive the attack Ten guerrillas including me Son Jihye, Hwang Bau, a forced laborer and a civilian named Han Dongju. The rainy season has begun. Barley will start rotting. Oh. dear lady! Please stop him! Oh! dear lady! Hey. hurry up! Ah. captain! Captain! Please save the lady! Stay away comrade Kang! We are not sure if we will survive. So what's wrong with having some fun? You beasts! Don't make a fuss. She's not even a virgin. She's pregnant. What? What is this? Look at her. She looks dead -Move aside. -Oh. my god! How horrible! Attention! Bow! Have a seat. You know what class this is? It' music class. That's right. Let's sing the song we've learned in the last class. Yes. ma'am. Ready. start! My hometown was on the hill that was, full of peach blossoms, apricot blossoms and baby azaleas. I miss the time when I played in the colorful flower palace It was then that I decided to surrender. The next night Hwang Bau and I came out with an excuse of looking for food. -Hey. is everything okay? -Yes. sir. -Keep alert. -Yes. sir. You could have escaped if you wanted. Why didn't you run? Because of the poor lady. -How old are you? -I am 43. -Got wife and kids? -No. I don't have anyone. Why not? I spent all my life working as a servant. -You are from this village. aren't you? -Yes. I am. Then do you know a man named Jo Ik-hyun who lives in here? Jo Ik-hyun? He and I attended school together in Japan. I saw him strike the school bell this afternoon. Ah. you mean the rich guy? Yes. I know him. Who are you? Quiet! -Are you a guerrilla? -It's me. Don't you recognize me? -You are Manho. right? -Yes. I am Kang Manho. Really? It is you. Manho. That night I told him I wanted to turn myself in. And he agreed to help me. He said he'd help me surrender safely, by introducing me to Yang, who led the youth association in the village. So I made up my mind to surrender and left. Don't tell anyone about what happened tonight. -I won't. -Let's go! -Who are you? -It's me. Comrade Kang! I brought some food. Have some. Unpack the bag. now. Food is here. We're starving. Comrade Kang. You did a good job tonight. -There is even some rice cake. -Oh. god. Have some rice cake. It's been ages since I've eaten rice cake. Oh. god. How horrible... Who did this to you? Poor thing! Who did this? Lower your voice comrade Kang. Son of a bitch I'll shoot you all. She seemed to go mad. so I ... Even you raped her. I'll kill you. Calm down. If you shoot and expose us we will all be killed. Please forgive me. Please. please. You're a civilian. how could you... Oh my. poor lady Have a nice vacation! Always be good kids and take care. Yes. ma'am. And make sure to do your homework. Yes. ma'am. Don't eat anything raw because you could get a stomachache. Yes. ma'am. Do I have to boil watermelon. too? -What? -Hahaha. Who laughed in a deep voice like a grown up? -We didn't... -It's not nice to play tricks. -Yes. ma'am. -Well. you can go home now. -Good-bye. -Bye-bye. -What's this? -Keep it somewhere safe to yourself. This map shows where Jihye's father hid his fortune. He gave it to me. If something happens to me today. you give it to her later. -How do you mean? -I've decided to surrender. What? I'll surrender first and try to save you and Jihye. You do as I tell you. Promise me to save her no matter what The day I was supposed to meet Yang Dalsoo, I went there by myself. -lkhyun. -Ah. Dalsoo. -You are here by yourself? -Yes. I am -Come in. -He's not here yet? No. He'll come soon. Maybe he's too scared to come? Have a sit first. Let's have a drink. Ah. why don't we wait until the guy guerrilla red guy gets here? -Okay. -Where on earth is their hiding place? -I don't know. -You said there are thirteen of them? They will all surrender if you guarantee their safety. I guarantee it. That must be him. Manho? Oh. come in. Manho. Come on. don't worry. Well. I'll introduce you two. This is the youth association leader Yang. This is Kang Manho. Because I am friends with both of you you two should could become friends. too. Come on. say hello. Don't be nervous. Let's talk over some drinks. -Thanks. but I won't drink. -Why? -Who would drink in my situation? -Ah. right. -Are you here by yourself? -Yes. I heard about you. Are you serious about this? -As long as you assure my safety. -I promise. How? Under instructions from the chief martial law commander of this province. surrendering guerrillas are to be released after some investigation Who investigates? The martial law enforcement office gives the final judgment. but my opinion is crucial. Now let's talk about how to surrender in detail. Where is your hiding place? -We are in the basement of the school. -What? Hurry up! Go there! The first platoon. Come this way! Who are they? They are South Korean forces. right? Attention. you guerrillas. You are surrounded. Stop resisting and surrender. Otherwise you will be all killed. Get down! They must have informed them. I'll kill you! Stop! If they are the informants. I think it's better to hold them hostage. -You're right. -Good idea. Let me talk to them. Okay. go ahead. Hey. use this. Comrades. I'm Kang Manho. Give up your arms and surrender. They promised not to kill you if you surrender. Son of a bitch! Betrayer! Bullshit! You damn anticommunists! I will surrender. Don't shoot me. Don't shoot him. He wants to surrender. Help me.. Throw in a hand grenade. No. You promised not to kill them. Son Jihye and Hwang Bau are in there. -Get out of his way! -No! Get down! No! Don't give up! Let's go out! I don't want to die. Go away. I'll save her. If you go out. too. who can I rely on? No. I don't want to die. Let me go. Lady! I want to surrender. Long live I am for South Korea! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Captain. please help her! -No! Don't go -Captain. where are you? No In the end they survived and were interrogated by the police. And after being taken to the martial law enforcement office for investigation. I served my sentence of two years. Since then I've shut myself from the outside world. because I was ashamed of myself. I've spent the past 20 years like this. I'm totally exhausted now. You said you were released from prison after two years. Have you ever seen Son Jihye since then? No. I haven't. Have lunch. -Thank you for your time. -Why don't you have lunch? No thanks. Take care. I know this is rude but aren't you the father of Son Ji Hye's baby? -What? What are you talking about? -It just popped into my head. You didn't take care of her even though her father had asked you to. May I guess the reason? Maybe that's because you couldn't. Maybe that's because you couldn't. I mean because you were the guy who got her pregnant. But you didn't want other guerrillas to know about that. so you kept away from her and didn't take care of her. As a result. she was brutally raped by the guerrillas. Therefore I can say you were successful in concealing who the baby's father was. At least from everyone. except you and her. of course. But I guess you weren't so shameless. considering the fact that you did give her father's fortune to her. Maybe you felt some sort of guilt. You did the right thing. You did the right thing. I don't mean to blame you at all. Anyway. this is not the case I'm investigating. I'm sorry to remind you of the past. Everyone makes a mistake. Father! Father! Was I too harsh? He isn't the murderer after all. But he should be punished at least in an emotional way. Isn't Son Jihye's life too pitiful? -Stop! Stop! -Why? Father. my father .... -Father! -Mr. Kang! Mr. Kang! Please hurry up and help him. doctor. What happened to him? -Father -No! No! Father You are the police? You've killed my father. What kind of a policeman tortures a sick person to death? Bring my father back to life! Bring him back! Gwangju Public Prosecutor's Office It's freezing cold. Yes. sir. Detective Oh. you can come in. I'll root out illegal slaughter in our province. Am I clear? Sit. have a smoke. I want to remove myself from this case. I know how you feel. But you think that makes sense now? Come on. start again from where you left off. You said Son Jihye is your second suspect? Let me give you her address. Get Son Jihye's address from the provincial headquarters. -Excuse me. would you like to drink with me? -Sure. thanks. -Where are you headed? -I'm going to Seoul. Really? Me. too. Nice to hear that. I am a little nervous. I've never been to Seoul. By the way. why are you going to Seoul? I'm going there to make a living. Isn't it better to stay in the country? No. it's better to go to Seoul. Even if I have to do rough work. Don't you have any family? I had a son. but he died during the Vietnam War. And my wife couldn't recover from the shock and died. Since then. I've led a wandering life like this. Hey. I told you not to play outside. It's too cold. I cannot afford to take you to a doctor if you catch a cold. Excuse me. Son Jihye lives here. right? She's not here now. Do you know where she is now? I have no idea. Go inside right now. Look at you. You must be freezing. -When will she be back? -I said I don't know. Please help me. Why don't you ever listen to me. boy? He is so cute. Here. go get some cookies with this. Do you have to see her? Tell Bongsun to come! -Here you are! -Okay. Are you trying to rip me off? Take this. -Make sure they order as much as possible. -Okay. Is there a woman named Son Jihye? -May I take your order? -Get me a bottle of soju. Hey. Bongsun. Sing us your favorite song. Shit. Bastard! He never tips but always flirts. How long have I been away from my hometown? After ten years of being away from home, my youth is gone. Have a nice drink. I am so heartbroken when I think about where I am. I open the window and see the dreary sky... -Hey. let me kiss you. -No. stop. Shit. She bit me. What? She bit you? Who do you think you are? Get out! Calm down. She is so arrogant. Yeah. with her looks. she thinks she can get away with anything. Have a drink and enjoy yourself. Bottoms up! Let's make a night of it. Cheers! She ruined the atmosphere. Hey. Bongsun. Are you okay? What a bad day! I'm not paying. Who does she think she is? She shouldn't work here if she doesn't like how she's treated. Calm down. please. You'll sleep with me the next time I'm here. Keep that in mind. Hey. help her up. What? Who are you? What did you say? I told you to help her up. What are you? Are you kidding me? You want to die? -Help her up! -Yes. yes. It serves those mean rascals right. -You were so great. -Go in the room. What are you doing. Bongsun? Go in the room with him. Go on. Have a drink inside. Half of your bill is on the house tonight. Have a seat. please. What a mess! You sit down. too. Hey. why don't you play us your accordion? Show us what you've learned. Okay. -Thank you for helping me. -You're welcome. May I have a cigarette? Move closer to him. -Son Jihye. -Who are you? Don't be afraid. I don't mean to harm you. -You must be from the police. -Yes. I am Oh Byungho from Munchang. The police are really meticulous. Coming all the way here to find me. Sorry. I didn't want to bother you. But I didn't have any other options. Well. what brought you here? -You must suspect me of murder. -That's not really the case. But I heard you didn't like Yang Dalsoo. Didn't like him? I hated him. I even wanted to kill him. Why? -I can't tell you that. -You must tell me. Otherwise you will be under suspicion. -I'd rather like that. -Ma'am! Please arrest me and kill me. Life is too hard. I'd like to end it. Please don't think that way. ma'am. I heard from Kang Manho what happened to you. After surrendering. you lived with Hwang Bau. Kang Manho? Is he still alive? He died. It was partly my fault. Before he died. he told me the whole story. So please tell me. I know it's not easy for you. I guess I have no choice. You already know everything. You know Hwang Bau saved me from the school on fire. I owed him my life. And he took good care of me. Even better than he did of his own life. So I was quite willing to live with him. And I gave birth to the cursed baby. My little boy. Taeyoung. Sweetie. why are you crying? We decided to find the fortune my father hid. At that time, no one was allowed to go into the Jiri Mountain without permission. So we asked Yang Dalsoo to get the permission. He helped willingly. We all went into the mountain together. I felt him stealing glances at me. But I didn't know what it meant at that time. Watch your step. It must be somewhere around here. Let me take a look at it. I guess we came to the right place. It must be this cliff It must be here. Dig. I'm sure it is. Find anything? Hurry up. Pass it to me. Pass me the box. Open it. Father... But from the next day things started to go wrong. Why are you doing this to Bau? He didn't do anything wrong! What's wrong? You know Han Dongju. right? Hwang beat him when you surrendered. He was sick and now he's dead. His family filed a lawsuit accusing Hwang of his death. But Hwang will not get into trouble. Everyone knows he is innocent. He will come back soon. Taeyoung is crying. Go look after him. But he never came back and a month later he was put on trial. The prosecution argued that Hwang was a communist who was willing to work for guerrillas. And he stabbed Han Dongju to death in order to cover up his crime. I had no idea at that time. I was only 18. So what could I do? So I turned to Yang Dalsoo. He said he would help me. Kim Jungyeop -Can I talk to prosecutor Kim? -Okay. -Let's go inside. -Yes. Excuse me. I hate to bother you. but she's so eager to see you. So I couldn't say no to her. I'm sorry. -Please help my husband... -OK. follow me. Go ahead. follow him. Please. help my husband. If anything should happen to him. I won't be able to live. It's up to you. You need not do this if you don' want to. I don't intend to force you. As mentioned above. the crime committed by Hwang Bau the accused was cruel and intentional. Therefore the court should not sympathize with him. Under the criminal code. the prosecution is seeking the death penalty against Hwang Bau. Bau. Hello. I guess I will have to spend the rest of my life in here. So you should marry another man. If raising the baby is a problem. you can ask my sister to take care of him. Go to the village called Sangwon and look for the widow living with a crippled son. She will be easy to find. Tell her that I asked her to raise him. She will gladly take him. Yes. I am sure she will. Don't worry about me. And don't come to see me anymore. -Bau. -My Taeyoung... The wicked prosecutor lied to me. But there is nothing we can do now. Let bygones be bygones and start a new life with me. I couldn't even cry. I was too stunned to resist him. After that, I came to live with Yang. He and I moved to Munchang and set up a brewery there with the money my father had left me. We had been together for 20 years until he died. I guess I talked too much. Why am I so talkative tonight? What is the use of talking about a dead man? Whatever he's done. we were together for 20 years and even had a daughter together. I just feel sorry for Bau. I really feel sorry for him. She is not the killer. Though she loved and hated Yang Dalsoo for during the 20 years of her life, she is not the kind of woman who could kill someone. Then who is the murderer? Hwang Bau? He's in prison. Ah, I have a bad headache. Hello. Social Affairs Department. Reporter Eom? Hello. Printing Department. Who? Reporter Eom? Hey! Eom. There's a call for you. Hello. Eom speaking. Who? Byungho? It's been a long time! Yes. it's been a long time. Nice to talk to you. -Yes. what's up? -Can I borrow some money? Hey. you won't come if it wasn't for the money? Come right now. Let's meet at the coffee house in my office building. You've changed a lot. Really? So did you. But why are you standing here? Why aren't you inside? -I have no money for coffee. -Come on. let's go inside. Hey. what happened to your face? You didn't even shave. -I have been busy... -Have a seat. -May I take your order? -Two cups of coffees. please. You haven't changed. You know how life is. -How much do you need? -30.000 won. I read an article about you. It said you were accused of torturing a suspect to death. -Are you okay now? -Yes. I'm fine. It would have been something to see you in prison. huh? I wish I could live like him. But I have to find the third suspect. Pungsan Station Who are you? -What's the matter? -The man... Hello. Detective Oh! Hello. long time no see. Yes. it's been a long time. When did you come back? -Have a nice day. -See you tomorrow. -Let's go. -Yes -What brought you here this time? -I'm here to meet someone. I'm not that someone. am I? You look shorter than the last time. I feel I'm getting shorter and shorter. It must be because of the case. You think so? Tell me about your wife. She died last year in a car accident. -Excuse me. -Good to see you again. -How have you been? -Fine. thanks. I'll tell you something. Let's go over there. I've been waiting for you. I knew you would come. The reason I wanted to meet you has to do with poor Hwang Bau. I feel sad when I think about him. You know he was found guilty of killing Han Dongju and was sentenced to life in prison. Yes. I know. -But Han Dongju is still alive. -What? Here it is. 20.000 won. Deal the cards. -Yes. good. good. -Today is not my day. How are you. Mr. Park? Good. -Are you sure your father is in here? -Yes. he's been here since last night. -Dad. did you win any money? -Ah. hey! Sorry to bother you. Can I talk to you. Mr. Park Young Jae? What? This is Detective Oh from Munchang Station. Let's run. Hey. what's wrong? I was just watching. Take it easy. You said you have seen Han Dongju? Well. I am not sure. I just caught a glimpse. Hey. what are you talking about? You told me you saw him. Yes. I did. But I'm not sure now. Maybe it was just an illusion. What? An illusion? Tell me exactly what happened. No. I didn't see him. Don't talk rubbish. Are you trying to make a fool of me? -I'm sorry. detective. -That's alright. Would you excuse us? Don't be hard on him. He's still my son. -How much money did you get? -I didn't win any money. No. I mean how much were you paid by Han Dongju. What? I've already found out that he's still alive. You can't deny it. If you don't tell the truth. I'll accuse you of gambling and perjury and put you in prison. -You saw him. right? -Yes. I did. -When? -Two years ago. -Where? -At the Gwangju Station. -Is this the place Han Dongju's family live? -Yes. -Are you the owner of this house? -Yes. Why do you ask? I'm from the police and I need to look inside your room. What? Why? When did Mr.Han pass away? He passed away a long time ago. during the Korean War. Could you open this for me? Is this man your husband. Han Dongju? Yes. -Bae Jeongja. this is your name. right? -Yes. Who wrote this letter? My cousin. Can I keep this letter? What? Well... -Miss Han. -Yes? You haven't received the result of Gochon's compost productivity campaign yet? -Mr. Han. -Yes? He's waiting for you. -Are you Han Bongju? -Yes. I am. but why... Nice to meet you. I'm from the police. May I have a word with you? Wow. it's cold. -You don't look well -Yes. I have a chronic stomachache. -I'm sorry to hear that. -Huh Welcome. -Have a seat. -Yes. Where is your older brother. Han Dongju. now? What? What did you say? I asked you where Han Dongju is right now. What are you talking about? He passed away a long time ago. Really? Of course it's true. The whole world knows that my brother is dead. It's true. Really? Yes. of course! Why in the world would you say that? Is it really true? Why don't you believe me? Listen. How can you say such a thing? -Let's go -Where? Hey. where are we going? Why are we going to the police station? -Just follow me -But... -Nice to see you. Kim. -Hello Ah. everyone is working so hard. Hello. Jeong. -Nice to see you. Oh. -Hey. look. -Just let me be. -Hey. hey. Hello. Shim. I need a room -to interrogate him. -Wait. He says he's from the Munchang Police Station and without any explanation he wants to interrogate me. Please do something. Come over here. Hurry up and do something. Okay? I'm Kim. the chief investigator. You're from the Munchang Station? Yes. Why are you investigating Mr. Han Bongju? Because I need to. So what is it that you need to investigate? I can't tell you at this point If you're investigating in our jurisdiction. don't you think you should tell me what you're up to? Since it didn't happen in Pungsan. I don't think you really need to know. What? Are you really with the police? Let me see your ID. Now that you've seen it. please give me a room. Give him the room in the back! Not the interrogation room. -Let's go -Huh? The room in the basement is damp and musty. This room is much better. I don't know what you are investigating. but please don't be too hard on him. He is a friend of our chief investigator. So try to be nice for our sake. If you need our help we can look into some things for you. Don't worry. Okay then. Why are you lying? I don't know what you mean. -Ouch... -You know Hwang Bau. right? What? A man called Hwang Am. who was arrested because of you. I know. Do you know what happened to him? He is in prison serving a sentence. -Why? -He killed my brother Why are you doing this? I didn't do anything wrong. Why are you beating me? Beating? You reported him. right? You accused him of killing your brother. -Didn't you? -I did. Why accuse a man of something he didn't do? Your brother Han Dongju wasn't killed by Hwang Bau. Hwang beat him. but he didn't kill him. You secretly hid your brother and accused Hwang Bau of murder. Why? Tell me why you did that. Because of your accusation. Hwang's been in prison for 20 years. That's a really serious false accusation. Have you ever thought of what he's been through? Tell me! This is outrageous! This is really unfair. It's bad enough having my brother killed so wrongfully. How could you do this to me? Who on earth would say someone is dead when he is actually alive? Tell me. Can you prove that your brother is dead? Yes. How? We can dig up his grave. -Okay. let's do that right now. -No. It will enrage my family's elders. Let's dig later. at night. -At night? -Yes. Let's go. It's cold. Why aren't we going? Kill him. Die. you bastard. Die. Die. What? He killed Han Bongju? Arrest him for murder immediately. -Should we cuff him? -Of course. Don't go easy on him just because he's a policeman. Put on an alert and report to the headquarters. -Yes. sir. -I will report to the chief. What's wrong with you people from Munchang? Hello. Look. Chief Kim. Do you want me fired? How could you let your man murder someone in my jurisdiction? Sorry. Chief Choi. Is that all you can say? Do something about it. Of course. I will take care of it as soon as I receive his report. What report? Bring him in immediately. We already put him on the wanted list. You know that no one on the wanted list gets arrested. Stop talking to me like I'm one of those reporters. And tell me the whereabouts of that detective. I told you I haven't received any report from him. What? Why are you being like this? I heard that you personally asked that detective to handle a case. So if you don't know what's happening. who does? -I can't tell you. even if I know. -What? He is currently investigating something of a great consequence. something that all of us should be held responsible for. -Responsible? -Yes. responsible. That man is carrying the cross instead of idle people like you and me who should be held accountable. So how can I have him arrested? Under no amount of threat. would I allow myself to arrest him. That's the least I can do for my conscience. What? There's an urgent report. Chief. Must be from the headquarters. Such a pain in the neck. -What is it? -Waiting for you on the line. Okay. Bolt up -It's me. -It's me. Oh Byungho. I know. but why did you kill him? I shot him because he tried to kill me. So it's self defense? Got any witnesses? Yes. but they are all his men. How can you be so stupid? I ask you to solve a murder. but you go off and kill someone? -Turn yourself in first. -I can't. sir. I can't do that. sir. I really want to solve this case. There's no other reason. I will report to you if you give me a few more days. Then I'll turn myself in and also turn in my badge. So please let me solve this case. How much more time do you need? Two weeks. sir. Okay. I will give you a month. Thank you. Thank you so much. -I have to go. -You need to recover... It's okay. Don't worry. this is what we do. Oh! Ah...ouch. I'll wrap this up for you. Thank you. See you next time. When? If it's meant to be. we'll meet later somewhere. Good bye. Who are you? Are you Park Yongjae? What? Who are you people? -We're from the police. Let's go. -What? Where? To the police station. I won't gamble ever again. So please let me go just this once. Come with us. Okay then. but not like this. I need to put some clothes on. -This way -To the hill. What? To the hill? But the station is that way. Why go to the hill? Shut up and just come. Are you really the police? I want to see some ID. Like hell you will. Whatever it is. please let it pass just this once. Are you going to kill me? What's going on? We brought him. -Sit. -Oh! -Yongjae. don't you recognize me? -Dongju. That's right. It's me. Han Dongju. I have lived in hiding for twenty years. Now I am an old man. During the twenty years. I couldn't sleep peacefully for a single night. I know it's because of something that I've done. I wanted to be safe. even if it meant hiding like this. But now it's all over. Because of your big mouth. my safety is jeopardized. Even after being paid. you broke your promise. I can't let a blabbermouth like you live. I know we had some good times. But for my sake. you must die. Bury him. I want to know what Youngjae did wrong. What's happening? Why did you take my son? Give my Yongjae back. What do you mean? We didn't take him. No. you took him last night. Is this some kind of a joke? Anyone here see Park Yongjae? Please. sir. Tell us exactly what happened. -You tell them what happened. -I will. Last night people came to our home and kicked me like this and took my husband. He liked gambling. but this is too much. This is nonsense! Kidnapping in a small village like this. Go get that gambler's wife. I need to ask her some questions myself. -Kim. -Yes. Are you going to get Oh or not? -I'll get him. -Then hurry up. Ah... Mother. Please eat this before it gets cold. Magpie's New Year was yesterday and our New Year is today. I wear a pretty ribbon in my hair and put on new shoes. -Detective Oh? -Yes? Chief Kim sent me. I'm his brother-in-law. Yes. I have been told. I'm Oh Byungho. Noh Hongjin. -Here's money for your investigation. -Thank you. You have to be careful. Even here there's a warrant for your arrest. I know. My brother-in-law is in an awkward position these days His superiors are trying to hold him responsible. But he doesn't care and wants you to keep on investigating. He seems especially devoted to this case. I'm afraid I have failed him. I don't know what you and my brother-in-law are up to. But I also became a policeman not just to make a living but to do something I believed in. -You've done well. -No. I haven't. I have avoided difficult tasks for the sake of my career. What you did really made me think a lot. You are very much like your brother-in-law. He is a great man. Yes. this is the District Court. Look. it says Gwangju Songjeongdong 250... Where can I see the records? -Come this way. -Thanks. Take a look over here. Here are all the trial records from October 1952. Hwang Am(Hwang Bau) Hwang Am Yang Dalsoo Yang Dalsoo Prosecutor Kim Jungyeop Kim Jungyeop. Kim Jungyeop. Kim... Lawyer Kim? Kim Jungyeop the laywer... Wow. it's really cold this winter. It sure is. Chief. there's a call for you. -I'll get it. -No. I'll get it. -Who is it from? -The station. sir. Really? Please help yourselves. It's me. what is it? -It's Detective Oh. -Really? Connect him. You are connected. sir. Chief. it's me. Oh. Yes. what is it? How are you? I'm fine sir. remember the murder of lawyer Kim Jungyeop that took place last winter in Seoul? -Yes. I do. -Is it still open? Yes. it is. Why do you want to know about that? I think Kim Jungyeop's murder and Yang Dalsoo's case are connected. What? What do you mean? Twenty years ago. the prosecutor of Hwang Bau's case was Kim Jungyeop What? I found Kim's name and phone number written in Yang Dalsoo's notebook. Hwang Bau must be the murderer. Ah. this is a major problem. Did you check whether Hwang Bau is dead or alive? Not yet. sir. I'm planning on doing that. Hurry up and find him. Now this has turned into a double murder case. Yes. sir. -Let me go inside your office. -You can't. sir. -Please. -No. business hour are over. Gwangju Correctional Institution Damn it -About Mr. Hwang Am. -Yes. I've located him. You did? He was here for five years and then transferred to Suncheon. Suncheon? Mr. Hwang Am came here in 1958. He was then transferred in 1962. -To where? -Mokpo Correctional Institution. Please... Sorry this is all I can do. Mokpo... Hwang Am was here from February 1962 to September 1967. Where was he transferred to? To Wonju Correctional Institution. Wonju Correctional Institution Hwang Bau was released last year on May 10th. What? He was supposed to be discharged at the end of last year. But he was discharged early on parole for good behavior Why so early? Didn't he receive a life sentence? He is a decent man. I haven't seen anyone like him in my life. He would do all kinds of chores whenever he was asked. He lit up the institution and inspired his inmates. Because I was moved by his character I taught him how to read and write. I ended up learning about the greatness of human beings from him. Hwang Bau is the conscience of the Korean people. I still can't understand how a person like him murdered someone. Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? -Who are you? -Are you the owner of this house? -Yes -I'm with the police. What is it? Does Mr. Hwang Bau. or Mr. Hwang Am. live here? He's not here right now. -Where is he? -He said he was going to Seoul. -When? -Why do you ask? What did my uncle do this time? You people locked up an innocent man for 20 years and what more do you want from him now? Why? Why? Who are you? -I'm from the police. -From where? He's a police officer. He is here to see uncle Bau. Then don't just stand there in the cold. You should come in. It's humble. but come in. Sit over there. That spot is warm. So what brings you here? Did Bau do something wrong again? No. I think Mr. Hwang Bau was wrongfully imprisoned and also... And what? Oh. it's nothing important. so you don't need to know. For the sake of Mr. Hwang Bau. Please tell me the truth. Where did Mr. Hwang go right after he was released? He was here all along. He had nowhere else to go. Please answer carefully. It's an important matter. My uncle didn't get out at all. except for this time. He went to Seoul to meet Taeyoung. Who is Taeyoung? He is Bau's son. his one and only son. Tell me more about Taeyoung He is the most pitiful child. It was 18 years ago when his mother moved in with Mr. Yang. When Mr.Yang started being cruel to the boy, his mother decided to bring him here, just as Bau told her to. Is this Mr. Hwang Bau's house? Yes. Why? What is it? Tell me. Who are you and what happened to Bau? -He is in prison. -Prison? Oh. Bau in prison. How can this happen? What can we do? Who are you? And who is this child? -This is Bau's son. -Oh And I am Bau's... Ah. you are Bau's wife. So good to have you here. Oh. so this is Bau's little boy. It's nice that he has a child at least. I though he would never get married. Then 18 years later on a spring day. Mother. Uncle is here. mother. What? Who? -Uncle is here. Mother -Uncle? -Oh... -My dear sister. Oh Bau. Bau! -Bau! -My dear sister. Mother. I'm home. He's your son. Taeyoung Taeyoung. my dear boy. You have grown so much. This is your father -Taeyoung... -Father... Nobody told me. Father. where have you been all this time? Because I've been bad and because I was stupid. I had to wander around. Then Taeyoung changed one day. After meeting someone in town, he stopped going to school and sat crying for days while looking at his father. Taeyoung. give this to him. -Here. father. drink some water. -Don't go. stay here. I will make you a nice pair of shoes with the skills I learned. He disappeared and could not be seen since. Bau went to Seoul to look for his son. How do you know he went to Seoul? -Did Bau tell you? -No. He left abruptly after receiving a letter from Seoul. From whom was the letter from? I don't know. It didn't have a sender's address. It must be from Son Jihye. Then it is almost certain that Taeyoung is the murderer. Taeyoung must have killed them before going to Seoul. I should go to the site and check. I'm with the police. Are you here because of illegal butchery? No. I just stopped by to keep away from the rain. Come in. Come this way. -Sit here. -Thank you. -Dry yourself. -Yes. thank you. -You live here alone? -Yes. that's how I ended up. Don't you get scared living alone in a place like this? What choice do I have? I don't have a home. so this is where I live. And what is this place? The owner asked me to take care of this place. I don't know why. But people don't do farming anymore. He asked me to stay and take care of the machines. So I'm staying here secretly butchering cattle and pigs. -Since when were you here? -I came here last spring. -Here you go. -Thank you. -Exactly when in spring did you come? -Around March. Then do you know about the murder that happened at the reservoir? Why? You think I was involved with that murder? No. I'm asking to see if there was anyone who stopped by here on that day. I don't know. I wasn't here that day. Where were you? I went to the village to get some liquor. Liquor? You like to drink? I drink sometimes But that day. I went to buy my friend a farewell drink. A farewell drink? Did you bid farewell to someone? Yes. a young man who stayed here with me for about a month left on that day. By any chance. is the young man's name Taeyoung? That's right. I hadn't known him before. But I let him stay because he said he had nowhere else to go. He must be Taeyoung. She moved away the day after you came by. -You don't know where she went? -No. I don't. Oh. Well. she didn't want me to tell anyone. Especially you. It's okay. tell me. All right. then. She gave me this number because she owes me money. I think it's a coffee house. -Good bye. -Good bye. -He paid. right? -Yes. -Madam. -Yes. sir. Welcome. Please get me a pack of cigarettes. Oh. I will. sir. -A pack of cigarettes for table 13. -Madam. Yes. Come sit here and drink coffee with us. Sorry. but I'm a bit busy right now. But why are you leaving? Thank you. please come again. Hey. I thought you weren't coming. I was late because of some work I had to finish. Oh. I see. -Thanks. it was very useful. -You can pay back later if you want. -No. it's okay. -Wow. feels like winning the lottery. -I need your help this time. -What? Me? I need to tail someone. but I'm already exposed. So I need your help. Okay. I'll help. but you've got to tell me what it's all about. Hello. sir. It's freezing. Sit here. it's warm. This way. please. You know about the Kim Jungyeop's case? Yes. it's still open. What about that case? It might be solved. What? Where did you hear that information? I didn't hear about it. I investigated it. I found out some things while working on the Munchang reservoir case. What? In short. I think the reservoir murder and the Counselor Kim's case are connected. What? Tell me more in detail. What do you mean? How could that be? Before I tell you everything you must promise me something. I know you want to write about the case. But this case is special. You can hurt a lot of people if you write about it. So don't think of this as an item for a newspaper article. But listen to this objectively. Okay. whatever it is. hurry up and tell me. Wow. it's cold. Ah. it's freezing! Eom! Hurry up. Why are you dressed like that? It's cold. But still... Let's go inside. No. if she sees my face she will run again. Until when do you plan on standing there? -Until she comes out. -And when is that? She'll come out before the curfew. Do you want to freeze to death? Put this on and go inside You need to warm yourself. I'll stay outside and keep watch. Okay. but take off your coat and keep low profile. Good evening. sir. -What would you like to drink? -Coffee. Yes. sir. So we have a date this evening right? Oh. alright. Why isn't he out yet? Hey. what are you doing? Where is she? -Is that her? -Not too loud! Wow. she must be really popular. Stop talking and hand me a cigarette. I'll get going now. Sorry for leaving early. -I'll be off now. -Okay. Good bye. -Yes. see you later. -Bye. Last bus! Last bus! Get on quick. Yes. hurry up. Please move to the back of the bus. Hurry up. The bus is leaving. All aboard! Please move to the back of the bus. There is plenty of room. Yeongseop! Stop boarding so many people. No more passengers! Hey. Hurry up and get off. Yeongseop! Wait for your turn. It's cold. Hey. what are you doing? Sorry. I lost her on the way. Gosh. What kind of a detective are you? Sorry. Did you follow her all the way ? Your motel room is terrible. How can you stay in this cold? -Come stay with me in my hotel. -Alright. Did you find out where she lives? I'm not like you. -Of course. I did. -Great! Excuse me. but I'm looking for the person who is renting this place. The couple just went out a few minutes ago. A couple? Yes. the husband and wife. Does the husband look old? Yes. an old man with silver hair. I don't know why such a young woman is with him. -Does she have a son? -I don't think so. Did they say where they were going? No. they didn't. I'll take a look that the room. But hey. who are you? I'm with the police. Yongin Mental Hospital Internal Medicine Hwang Taeyoung Hwang Taeyoung? Yongin Neuropsychiatric Hospital You are here to see who? Hwang Taeyoung. A couple just came by. Ah. Taeyoung's parents must have dropped by. An old man with silver hair came. I see. How are you related to the patient? I'm his uncle. Alright. Please go wait in the interview room. -Nurse Hwang? -Yes. -Follow me. -Yes. To cure his illness. the family really needs to take good care of him. He looks fine. but his mental state isn't. He should eat well. But the food here isn't nutritious enough. So if you leave me some money I will get him some good food. -I see. -The interview room is that way. You have five minutes. Hey. give me a cigarette. You're here because Choi contacted you. right? Why aren't you saying anything? If Choi wants to take me. he should go ahead and do that! Who is Choi? Give me his name and I will take you to him. Tell me. I will get you out right now. Mister. this guy says he'll get me out! Uh... -You are here. -Yes. Police was here. -You are a persistent man. -Excuse me. but can I go inside? -No. -I have to meet Mr. Hwang. No. I don't want him to know. But he has to know at some point. So why avoid telling him? It's not much. but please take it. Someone from the police is here. How is Taeyoung's condition? -Have you been to his hospital? -Yes. today... Why are you doing this? Why won't you leave us alone? I understand why you are being like that. But I have my duties to fulfill. Now. I ask you. when did you meet Taeyoung? May of last year, when I was alone at home. I heard some sound and there was a young man outside. I asked who he was and he told me that he was Taeyoung. I cried without saying anything. Then I asked him to come inside. But he wouldn't come in. He asked me to never think of him as my son. Then he told me that he had something to ask. He asked if I knew that his dad was wrongfully imprisoned because of Yang. I just cried and couldn't say anything. He said his father was released after 20 years and is staying in Sangwon. I asked him to kill me. He said that I wasn't worth it and left. Mom? -Honey -Mom. I'm home. I'm home. Oh. she's like that again. So stiff. A few days later. Yang Dalsoo died. According to my investigation. this is what happened. Taeyoung was surprised when his father. whom he thought was dead. turned up after 20 years. Moreover, he somehow learned of his innocence and became enraged with vengeance. So he came to see his mother to check the facts and decided to find the villains and murder them. He waited around Kim Junyeop's house to murder him. Then he went to Munchang and hid at the butcher house. He attacked Yang Dalsoo on the day he came fishing alone. Afterwards. I mean. after Yang died. Taeyoung must have met you again. When and how did you two meet? After Yang died. I was forced out of the house. And when my daughter killed herself. I went to the station to go to Seoul. That's where I saw him. standing there in rage. Even though he was crazy. Taeyoung must have bragged how he got back at his father's enemies. You were shocked by what he said. so you took Taeyoung to Seoul and admitted him to a mental hospital to not only cure his illness but also to hide him. Then you wrote a letter to Sangwon. got Taeyoung's father to come to Seoul and you two reunited after 20 years. I can understand how you had to work at bars and coffee houses to pay for Taeyoung's hospital bill. Sir. arrest me. I have met Taeyoung and his mom. Now I can die in peace. Arrest this old man. Please take me. instead of Taeyoung. No. Take me instead. Arrest me. please! I won't arrest either of you. Don't worry. Under the law. the mentally ill are not incarcerated. Moreover. you are innocent. Moreover. you are innocent. Really? Can Taeyoung live? Can Taeyoung really live? -Yes. sir. -The law is fair. The court will show sympathy to Taeyoung's motive. And your innocence will be proven if you request a new trial. Really? Is that true? Can my husband really be cleared of all the charges ? Yes. he can. As a proof. Han Dongju. who is said to be dead. is alive. -Is that true? -Yes. it is. Everything will be solved once we get him. I will get him no matter what. Sir. please catch him and get my husband... No. it's okay if I die. but please let my Taeyoung live. I will. I'll come back again. If anything happens. please call me on this number. Thank you. Thank you. -Hey. Byungho. -Yes. You're looking around like you've never been in a place like this! -I'm feeling sorry for the marble floor. -Oh. don't worry. -A civil servant's shoes should be like that. -But... So did you catch the killer? -No. I couldn't -What? Why? -He's in a mental hospital. -What? Hello. And there's something else that's fishy. What is it? There is an instigator behind the murderer. This just gets worse! So many things remain unknown Who is it? But is it really important to the case? Yes. someone told everything to Taeyoung and then all this happened. So someone who told Taeyoung everything is the actual killer. Then you must go and look for that person. Um... You are really going to get busy. won't you? Wow. why is your room so nice? You must be rich. Stop joking! The company rented this room because they wanted me to write about this case. But still. Where's the bed? Over there. -You must be tired. -How much is this room per night? 100.000 won. That's half my monthly salary. Yes. but you should try sleeping in a place like this. I don't know if I can sleep. -Ahh! -You must really be exhausted. Yes. I am. What should I do? They want me to write a story. And I want to expose all this. too. Okay. write about it. But like this... Urgent news! Urgent news! I wonder how it feels to be innocent and be locked up for 20 years. I'd go crazy. But are they sure he is innocent? The man he allegedly killed is said to be alive. So the police are digging up the grave to confirm it. This is going to be interesting. -Dig. -Yes. Start digging. They are digging...digging Dig a bit this way. Hey. let me take a look. What? That's Park Yongjae! Why is Yongjae lying in Han Dongju's grave? This is a fake grave. Someone killed Yongjae and put him here. Hello? Ah Eom. how did it go? It was a great success! You were right. The grave was a fake and Bae Jeongja turned really pale. She will probably go somewhere. I will wait and tail her just like you told me to. Okay. Be careful. Hello? Oh. hello. Sir. Taeyoung is missing. I'm at the hospital They said that some men came and took him. Who could that be? Don't go anywhere. I'll be right there. Get me out of here! Why are you hitting me! Why! -Sir -What happened? Are you crazy? How can you release a patient without the guardian's consent? How can this happen? Get me the director! Take your husband home and stay there. I will find him. Yes. Let's go Good job. But who is that young guy? He's too young to be Han Dongju. -They are entering the market. -I know. Driver. don't stay too close. Hurry up. Wow. it's dawn and everyone is so busy. It's not easy making a living. We should do something about Kim. He is dumping. Take him out. -Who? -Kim of Wolseong Trading. Okay. -It's 1 .5 million won. -Put it in here. -I brought the lady. -Hello. -You are here. -Please sit. -Honey. I have some important news. -Really? Hey ... Put this in. -Let's go inside. -Follow me. This way Don't move! Turn off the lights Freeze! Get down! Get down on the floor! Freeze! -Han Dongju! -I'm Choi Daesoo. Han Dongju! 20 years ago. you disappeared from the hospital. Why? Yang Dalsoo and prosecutor Kim came to me and threatened to arrest me for being a communist. Then they told me that they would frame Hwang Bau as my murderer and that I am to hide forever. I'll tell you what happened next. While in hiding and living as a dead person. you became angry at Yang Dalsoo and Kim Jungyeop. So you met them.
