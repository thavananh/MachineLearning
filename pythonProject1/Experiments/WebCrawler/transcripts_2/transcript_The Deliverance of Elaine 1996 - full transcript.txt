Oh. Here's the letter I was telling you about. Oh, right! Thank you so much for doing this. Thank you for the letter. Sure. Thanks, Mary Ann. Bye. (woman) Bye! See you next week! (man) Yeah, good-bye. (mouthing silently) (woman) Bye now. ♪♪ (Elaine) Dear Mr. Skyler, your letter was forwarded to me by my church. I was asked to volunteer to be your pen pal. I'm not much of a writer, so you'll have to bear with me. I don't really know where to begin, except to introduce myself. How do you do? Don't you wonder what we will have in common? Maybe we will become the best of friends. (security guard chattering) I have opened a post-office box, and I will check it every day for your response. Write soon, please. People in my life see me as a patient person, but I'm as antsy as they come. Be well and know that God looks after all his children. Sincerely, Elaine Hodges. There you go. (grunting) Ah! (sighing) I should do us both a favor. Die in my sleep. We a little grumpy this morning? One good myocardial infarction, get the whole damn thing over with. If I go, will you be all right? Edna's not here yet, and I'd like to get an early start. Well, to hell with Edna. Answer me, Daddy. I gotta go. (Addison) I'll be fine! (door closes) All right, well, the juice is in the fridge. And the coffee's on. I'll see you tonight. Hey, Bobby. Miss Hodges. Well, what are you doing walking? Flat tire. Oh, well, hey, here. (whirring) (Elaine) There you go. (Bobby laughing) Miss Hodges. What's so funny? Oh, nothing. Yellow. What's yellow? The classroom was yellow. Yes, it was. I can read books. No one tried harder than you, Bobby. The classroom was yellow. Yes, it was. All right, chapter four. Everyone on 32? Benoit? Okay... "Three days later, Nicky was walking home "from his tuba lesson. "It was his birthday. "He gave a little skip of excitement. The day of the party had finally come." Are you following along? "When Nicky got to his little house, it was all dark." Sheri. "His heart was going..." (all) "Thump! Thump! Thump!" "'I'd better act very surprised,' thought Nicky." (gasping) All right, pull up, Sheri. Come here, pull up to the table. (indistinct chatter) (Charlie) Dear Elaine, I'm happy you replied to my letter. It is as though I've reached through the bars and taken grasp of a hand. Yours. Thank you. Hodges. Elaine Hodges. I like the sound of it. It speaks to me. Sure. (Charlie) There is a reason you and I, out of all the people in the world, will be friends. 'Cause I believe there's a reason for everything. Most in here don't want to face that, but I see it as a healing thing. Okay, everybody, hurry up! (Charlie) I kept your letter. I find that it heartens me at night knowing that we have so much in common already. Yes, already we hold a curiosity about each other, a bridge across a moat of loneliness. So what do you look like, Elaine? Send me a picture of yourself. (bell ringing) I wanna see your face. I'll bet you're pretty. I will think of you until you write again. Your truly, Charles S. Skyler. (camera shutter clicking and camera beeping) ♪♪ (pounding on door) (door opens) (Addison, echoing) What are you doing here? Get out of my house! You must be out of your mind! Put that gun away! You hear me? (woman shrieking) There's a gun! Addison! (gunshot) Mommy? Daddy? (Addison) God, you're out of your mind! (gunshot, Addison shouts) (man speaking indistinctly) (gun clicking) (gunshot echoing) Had my dream again last night. Oh, please, you're not gonna go through that again, are you? Sorry. It's always the same. It's-- Monotonous. To you. I can't stop myself from dreaming it over and over. I wish we could talk about it. No, you don't. Yes, I do. I never know why you say that. I do wish we could talk about things. You'd learn nothing. How many times have I said this? Something snaps in someone's mind and blood spills. It happens. We were unlucky. Just plain unlucky. Now, can we talk about something else? Edna's birthday is coming up. What do you think we should get her? I fired her this morning. (Addison groaning) Oh, why do I have to put up with this nonsense? Hey. You didn't think I'd leave just because he fired me, did you? I wouldn't blame you if you did. See, he knows that I know. I don't mean to rat on the man, but seeing as how he wants to treat me this way, I want you to know I found another liquor bottle. Hidden. Where does he get it? (Edna) I don't know how he gets it. Smuggles it in there somehow. All right, I gotta go. (Addison) It's not in the right position! What the hell? All this time you've been working with me, you should know where to put it!

(clock chiming) (groaning) (grunting loudly) (Addison groaning) Oh, I don't want-- Why did I-- (groaning) Thank you. Ah... (Elaine) Dear Mr. Skyler, your letter is surprisingly poetic. My goodness. You will be an interesting pen pal indeed. I teach the first grade in our local elementary school, and I love the enthusiasm of six-year-olds. I live with my father in the same house I was raised. I take care of him as he is an invalid bound to a wheelchair. Oh, there are moments, when I look at a brilliant sunrise, for instance, and then I think of what other kind of life I might have led... out there beyond the horizon... in some exotic place. But those are silly thoughts. Enough about me. Now, you tell me who you are. Write to me. I look forward to your next letter. Sincerely, Elaine Hodges. (Charlie) Dear Elaine, I'm sorry to hear about your father, but with due respect, I could puke at your letter. You piss on your freedom, but it's the only thing that makes you something. But choose a door and open the damn thing. Did I tell you I'm a cook in the prison galley? It is slop, I'm afraid, but I can't cook what I choose. One day, I will. One day. (Charlie) Hey. Hey! Boy, everything you touch ends up smelling like an armpit! Son of a-- oh! (whimpering) Oh! (Charlie) Tell me about your father and what he's told you. He's crippled. Why is he in a wheelchair? And what put him there? I need to know. Yours truly, Charles S. Skyler. P.S. Your letter smells of perfume. I thank you. (Addison) What are you doing here? Get out of my house! Are you out of your mind? (woman) There's a gun! Addison! (Addison) You shot my wife! Oh! Aah! (gun clicking) (woman) Oh, my... (gunshot echoing) (Elaine) Dear Charlie, late at night, when I was six years old, an intruder murdered my mother, crippled my father, and then committed suicide. My father will not discuss it. If I try and talk about it, he gets angry. Sometimes he stops talking to me altogether for days. (Addison) That's it! (Elaine) You should not judge me harshly. He's my father. And if a person has no loyalty to their own family, then I... I simply just don't know what else there is. I live the way I do because it's what I want. I'm sorry, but you've touched a nerve. There is a door to open. Let it be your own. I will join you in prayer for that day. Sincerely, Elaine Hodges. (man) Have a seat, Charlie. (door closes) Okay, Charlie. Your time's up. You're out. But... I think you're a bad bet. All you've ever known is trouble and the four walls of your cell. You'll be back. (Charlie clears throat) Yeah, I'm not a threat to anybody. All I wanna do is put my life back together and get a job. 'Cause I got a skill now. I could be a fry cook to start and maybe... maybe someday work in a fancy restaurant. You won't see me again. See, this time... I'm out for good. Somebody cares now. I'm not alone. I want to be a part of that world out there. And I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to be a part of that world. I can taste it. (phone ringing) (phone continues ringing) Hello? Just a minute. It's for you! Gentleman caller. (Elaine) Hello? Elaine, hi. Hi. (Addison) Your pasta is turning to paste! We, uh... didn't get a chance to, uh, speak at the school. Weren't the kids cute? Yeah. You looked really, really beautiful. I've been thinking a lot about you lately. If it's true love, he'll call you back! (Addison) Blah, blah, blah. Mm-hmm? Talk to him about your menopause! That'll shut him up! (Elaine) Yeah, I'm... good. No. Mm-hmm. (grunts) (clock chiming) (Elaine) Mm-hmm. (Timothy) Do you think... we could get together? A cup of coffee or something? (grunts) Elaine! (groans) There you go. Your legs are burnt, but I doubt they'll blister. I wish I would die. Now, now. Just a foolish, helpless old man. Shh, you just rest. You'll be all right. I'd be lost if you weren't here. I couldn't take care of myself. You know that. Daddy... What did Tim-- uh, why was he calling? Just to stay in touch. Oh, well, you'd have never been happy with him, never. Well, don't leave. I'm not going anywhere. No, I mean now. Sit, huh? Stay with me till I go to sleep, please. Okay. (bed whirring) (Addison groaning) No. No, you never would've been happy with him. Never, no. (dog barking in distance) (indistinct chatter on TV) I've gotta go now. Early day for me. What? What? What? (slowly) I've got to go now. Why? It's my birthday. Oh... you wake me up just for that? Well, I just thought you should know I was leaving in case you decided to choke yourself to death. Have you got any money on you? Oh, if I did, I wouldn't give any to you. No, I mean borrow it. With you, loaning it is the same as giving it. I'll pay it right back. Huh? 10 bucks? Just as soon as tear it up, throw it to the wind. So, go. Stop making such a big production out of it. Hope you don't have a car accident. I bet you can't swallow one whole. (plate clatters) "I.O.U." (Charlie) Dear Elaine, by the time you get this letter, I will be a free man, released. I credit your prayers. (mimics engine revving) I've dreamed of my freedom for so long, but it's not a life I know. And it's one I've been denied so many times before. They said things at the prison. They think I will fail. My blood runs cold when I hear their words because... I'm afraid they're true. That's why I need you, Elaine. I'm setting sail with no compass. You will be my eyes. You'll speak the language. And you need me, Elaine, in ways that you don't even know. The key you hold in your hand will unlock nothing less than the truth. (knocking on window) (gasps) Oh... Hector. You're very nervous, Elaine. Do you want to speak to me about something? I got heart palpitations. They say it's nothing, but I go to an HMO, and I don't trust them. Mm-hmm. Your father was a wonderful doctor. It's too bad he doesn't practice anymore. Yeah. I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm gonna have to go. Does he ever think of coming out of retirement? Oh, I don't think so. I gotta go now, Hector. Okay, well, let me know if he changes his mind. Okey-doke. (clock chiming) (dishes clattering) Oh, darn! I banged into the sideboard, damn it. Broke this family heirloom. Bull. This vase has been in the family for generations. I gotta fix it before Elaine comes home. Came all the way from... Scandinavia, damn it! Looks more like the five-and-dime to me. You'd be heartbroken, you would be, if you knocked over something like that, like an elephant tusk or something that your great-grandmammy lugged all the way over on a slave ship. I ought to push you off a cliff. Come on, Edna, help me! And why should I help you? Get the glue for me. It's down in the basement. It's probably on a work bench. How do you know what's down there? My basement, isn't it? Huh? Mm-hmm. Aye, good girl, good girl. (locks clicking) (Edna) Let me out of here! Wait! Let me out of here! (Edna pounding on door) Rat-faced snake-hearted gimp! (exhales) (indistinct chatter on TV) (meat sizzling) (bell ringing) Thank you. Mm-hmm. Say, you like your cook? Well, he shows up, works hard. I got no complaints, I guess. (door closes) How come? Mm-hmm. Just curious, I guess. I'm a chef. Oh, yeah? American or, uh, cuisine? Uh, French. Uh-huh. Yeah, you might've heard of it. It's called, uh, "En Prison." Oh, yeah, I think I heard of that place, yeah, sure. Right on. Whoa! Oh! Holy cow. Hey! Fire! I got it! I got it! What's going on in here? I got it! All right! (overlapping shouting) He got out and he knows where I live. I closed my post-office box, and this morning, that one came to the house. It unnerved me. I don't know what I was thinking. What can you expect from a person like that? It's okay. We all make mistakes. It was nice to hear from you the other night. It was nice talking to you. Look, I'll, uh... I'll go talk to him. Thank you. Anytime. I don't mean to overreact. He seemed a little crazy and-- I'll take care of it. You make a handsome family. It's worked out for me. Some thing's I'd never change. The woman I married wasn't my first choice. You know, I, uh, I looked out my window the other night. I could swear I saw you watching us. Were you? I need your help. Let me talk to your cook. Sure. Oh, he's a trained chef, by the way. (Charlie groaning) Elaine and I go back a long way, and she's had a hard go, and I'm not gonna let scum like you make it any harder for her. You understand? You've been warned, Charlie. (panting and groaning) What's going on here? (indistinct chatter) (Charlie) There you go, Miss. (woman) Thank you. You're new. Hey, I started last week. You cook this? Was there something wrong with it? I wanna shake your hand. You, sir, are a genius. I've never seen anything like-- (stammering) Who'd have thought... this cheese? Explain the... Well, that's cream cheese. It's, um, it's herbed. "Herbed"? Yeah, it's, um... it's tarragon, savory, thyme, little salt and pepper, and the tiniest bit of mint. Yeah, I experimented with the mint, actually. This is the best cheese omelet I've ever eaten in my life. I appreciate that. Stick around, sir. Gourmet. Nothing less. (Charlie) Dear Elaine, I said I meant you no harm, but you're hiding from me. Why? I've done nothing to hurt you. We can help each other. I know it. We can help each other be free of everything that's gone wrong in the past. You don't deserve the life you've been forced to lead. And I can say the same about myself. Though we're so different, we're kindred. We're family to each other. And you'll come to know that in time. In time. So don't cry. Don't be afraid. Your friend, Charles S. Skyler. Hello? (Charlie) I could smell your perfume from down the hall. Mr. Skyler. Mmm. Your-- The door was open. So, dear Elaine. I'm glad you came. Thought you would. I don't believe in locked doors. You look as pretty as your picture. I'm not sure what you thought you'd accomplish by coming here. You should never have come to this town. You never thought I'd get out. Right, Elaine? Well, I understand. I do. You wanna hear something true? Some die behind bars, but most get out one day or another. It's time and will. That's the secret. I volunteered to correspond with a pen pal. That was all. If I misled you in any way about my life or my intentions, I'm sorry, that was wrong. But you frightened me coming here. And that lieutenant? Is he a friend of yours? Did you send him to frighten me? He enjoys his power. But he's weak, you know? I seen that look a thousand times in a guard's eyes, standing over me. I liked your letters. "Dear Charlie. Dear Charlie," and "Sincerely, Elaine." That's a nice way for people to talk to each other, isn't it? It's decent. Why are you here? You tell me about it, that night a long time ago. What? The night your father was shot, your mama murdered. Why? Because it's important. Cruel things like that, they shape a person's life. That's true. And they say it helps to talk about things that hurt the most. Well, you're hardly the person I would talk to-- Losing everything so soon, it's like tying an arm behind your back and pushing you off a plank. How you gonna learn to swim? It's not fair. I appreciate your concern. I'm proud of you though, Elaine. You sacrificed. You kept yourself pure. I could never have done that. Look, Mr. Skyler-- It's Charlie. Charlie, I don't-- With everything that happened to you, with everything you'd given up and lost... you never hurt anybody. Why would I want to hurt anyone? Well, you'd be surprised. Yeah. See, a guy like me could learn from you. I need you more than I can put into words. Everything good that could happen to me from this point on depends on you. Don't say that. The world and I, we're at odds. And they know that back where I came from. They know I'm lost. Lost like a baby just born with nobody to help it. These people running this way and that way... running in all this open space. All this light and choice. You know, I went to a store the other day to buy a bar of soap, and I stood in the aisle for half an hour trying to figure out which bar to buy. (giggles) It made my dizzy. See, you can help it stop spinning... No, I can't. ...because it's your world, and you've got no reason to be afraid of it. There's nothing I can do for you, nothing. Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, everything you give, I'll pay you back. I'll pay you back and I can set you free! What are you talking about? Come on. There are a lot of ways to spend life behind bars. Now, you thought about leaving him, about having a life of your own. You can say it out loud! Don't you talk to me about my father, hmm? He's helpless. You don't understand the situation. Yeah, do you? You know what happened that night? Lies are every bit as much a cage as steel bars! Who are you to talk to me about these things? You're in jail, Elaine. You forget that, you'll never get out! I've lived with you forever. Sometimes I'm not sure who you are or what you feel about things. I let you know how I feel about you. Always tried to protect you from everything that I thought might cause you pain, like fathers do. I don't think we know how to talk to each other. What's gotten into you lately? You seem to be even worse than-- There's more to what happened that night... Don't start. ...than I have been allowed to know. Don't run from me! Who shot you? Why? You never stop, do you? I need to know! I mean, if there's something hidden away, I deserve to know! But I told you over and over and over it was a stranger. Now there's no more to tell. Then why do you get so angry when I ask? Because you're asking me for something that I can't give you. Or won't? I lost my legs and my wife. It was senseless. A lunatic with a gun shot us. Now, that is all I know. What was his name? He was a stranger! How the hell would I know his name? I don't believe he was a stranger! Please, do this for me. Out of my way. Just say his name. Am I being held prisoner in my own house? Addison! Are you looking for this? Who are you? Oh, I'm a friend. I don't have any friends! I didn't say I was your friend. I'm a friend of Elaine. Get off my property. Go on! Get the hell off of it! You're an alcoholic. Doesn't take a genius to see it, Addison. How do you know my name? What do you want? Boy, you bring nothing but misery, old man. What's the draw? I'm calling a cop. What? A good gig, old man. Make life hard for everybody and they just play along. If I could get out of this chair... You tell me who shot you. Just what is going on here? You know, somebody put you in a wheelchair. You must know who it was. That is my business. And I don't talk about it! You know, if you still had your legs, what do you think the odds are Elaine would still be hanging around here, wasting her life taking care of a piece of work like you? You hide behind your legs, Addison. Why? Why would I hide? I'm not guilty of anything. Guilt? No. I'm talking about punishment, Addison. Kill me or get out. Whatever it is you're gonna do, just do it! (Edna) Addison, I swear, when I see you... Don't you ever do that to me again! I swear to you, Addison Hodges, one day you're gonna just push me too far! I'm gonna make you rue the day that you were born! I won't be shoved around by some stupid, uneducated, no-good punk! I won't! What? What do you mean? I was just threatened by a maniac in my own backyard! Who? Your friend! That's what he said. He says he's a friend of yours. What did he say exactly? Well, I don't know. He was looming over me. I was afraid any second he was gonna crack my skull open! Who knows what he said? But he's crazy and he's going to kill us! Well, why do you say that? (stammering) Well, because he-he-he-he-he's insane. 'Cause he's-- Because it's random? No. No, not this time. Someone picked us again? Are you forgetting the little matter of you writing to this bastard? I'm surprised you didn't sit out a-- an extra place mat! You're upset. Damn right I am. Man like that will do anything. There's no conscience, no-no-no-no logic. (stammering) It's-It's reptilian! And we are at the mercy of it! Why are you looking at me like that? Huh? Why? (groans) (horn honking) (Elaine) Mary Ann? (engine turns over) (tires screeching) I'm sorry! You okay? Tim, I'm sorry. That was reckless of me. I'm sorry. That was a close call. I wasn't paying attention. I just-- sorry. What are you doing out here? Um... I'm sorry. You all right? I'm fine. God, I miss you. Oh, Tim. I miss you so much. Oh... ♪♪ (congregation singing in distance) ♪ Ocean depth of happy rest ♪ ♪ Thou our Father, Christ our Brother ♪ ♪ All who live in love are Thine ♪ ♪ Teach us how to love each other ♪ ♪ Lift us to the joy divine ♪♪ Mary Ann! Elaine. I need to talk to you. What is it? You're upset about something. I saw you the other night. Wednesday night. On Main Street, coming out of the apartment house. Yes. Of Charlie Skyler? You know him. You were there seeing him. Yes, that's true. What is this all about? What are you doing? Look, I'm very sorry, Elaine. I didn't know he was going to get out. The poor boy spent most of his life in prison. A boy? He's a dangerous man. And you led him to my door. Elaine, he won't hurt you. How do you know that? You can't say that. But you have no right to point a finger. He's not a piece of garbage. I pity him. (engine turns over) (Timothy) Come on, kids. It's cold out here. Come on. (door opens and closes) Boy, you miss things you don't even realize. Like squeezing a ball of dirt in your hand. (sniffs) That's peperomia? Used to read books in the prison library, and they had one on horticulture. Can remember everything I read. What do you want? I told you what I want. I don't know what this is all about. Mary Ann gave me this letter. Who is she to you? Mary Ann Rutherford married Sanford Rutherford right here in this town, 27 years ago. Her maiden name was Skyler. Look, I would've found you someday anyway. Even before I sent my first letter, I knew you lived in this town, and I knew the name Hodges. I knew the old man was shot and crippled. You torture me! Just say what you know! Well, the truth is like everything else. Nobody comes to it unless they're afraid. Stop it! Well, what are you afraid of, Elaine? Are you afraid of me? The hold your father has on you? Or are you afraid of the years to come? Now, that's a fear that'll rise up in your throat and choke you every bit as much as a crazy man. And when you think you can't breathe, you'll do anything. And even the truth will seem like a friend. Now, you ask him who she is. You ask him. I need to talk to you. So, talk. Who's this? Do you recognize her? Oh, I don't know. I think she was a patient of mine. It's such a long time ago, I don't-- What's her name? What? Where'd you get this? I want to know everything about this woman. Now, how would I know everything about her? She was just a patient of mine. I don't know, maybe... well, I think she lived around here somewhere. Matter of fact, I think she died rather suddenly. How? Oh, hemorrhage or something. "Or something"? You watch your attitude, young lady. I've had just about enough of this. (phone ringing) Hold on, whoever you are! I'm here! I'm here! Hello? (Elaine) Tim? Ah, just a minute. Kids, okay, that's enough. Come on, Daddy's on the phone now, all right? Just hang on. Okay, okay, that's it. Come on, go, go! (sighs) This is not a good idea to call here. You won't look at me. Now you don't wanna talk to me? What have we done? Uh, I think that my situation is pretty obvious. Uh, really? Not too much is obvious to me these days. Are you all right? No. I took you to my bed. Elaine... That meant something. Okay. I'm gonna hang up. Wait. Good night, Daddy! You have a beautiful family. I know you'd never want to see them hurting. I need you to do something for me. Do you understand? (door closes) This file... this file was never released to the press. The old chief and your father, they were good friends. Maybe he was a patient. Both. I-I don't know why you're doing this to yourself. Yeah, well, you're kind to worry about me. I do worry about you. There are things in there you shouldn't see. Not alone. Oh, my mother! Who would d-do some-- (stammering) Just tell me what it says. What does it say? The file doesn't contain a motive. And it doesn't identify the assailant except to say that it was a woman. A woman? (gun clicks and gunshot) How can that be? It was a woman? (Elaine groaning and grunting) (Elaine retching) Honey, you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. I'm just-- I'm tired. I just gotta get dressed. You're pregnant. What? Don't be ridiculous. You don't wanna lie about a thing like that. I think you'd be a fine mother. (Elaine sobbing) Oh, honey. Come-- oh, I-- Oh, it's o-- oh. Look, you're not alone. You remember that. I'm not so sure about that, Edna. This is... This is so stupid. It's a gift. It's something you can call your own. Does he know? My father? Oh, no, goodness. Your man? No. I haven't found the right moment to tell him. She was my mother. She was insane. Now, that's too easy. She and your father were lovers. I don't believe you. Oh, you think you're special, you should be spared? From lies. Well, no more lies, Elaine. I was ten when it happened. We lived in a little house maybe 15 miles or so from here. We were poor and she got sick. We came to your dad and he made her well. And she was pretty. He liked that. He was rich, a doctor, and he used her. I don't need to hear this. She knew he lied, but she grew to love him. To need him, yearn for him. Then she was a fool. Yeah, of course she was! Your daddy knew that. Your daddy likes being with a fool so he can get what he wants! You know that key I gave you? She wore it on a chain that hung around her neck. It opens up that little house in back where he'd practice medicine. What do you think of the truth, Elaine? I can't say it's a blessing. It's ruined my life. And again, the lies ruined yours. I gotta get out of here. He's cruel! He takes from people and he doesn't give back! You want me to hate my father for something that's over! It's done! You look at us.
