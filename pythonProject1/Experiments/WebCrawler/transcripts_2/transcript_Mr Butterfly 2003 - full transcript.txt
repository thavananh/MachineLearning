Eunji. There's an old saying that says send horses to an open plain, and send people to big cities. In short, whether you're human or animal, you need to get out in the open and mix with the crowd. So we're going to Seoul? Catch what I'm saying here. Not us, me. I don't know who said it, but I sure have respect for the guy. And that's why I need to get out of here. This place isn't for Yun Minje. You understand, right? Why do you always have to cry like that? I swear on this snow. I'll be back in a year on a snowy day like today. You trust me, right? Look. You trust me, right? You know how true our love is. How do you do? Go home. The shades aren't too dark? They're just fine. I told you. What are you doing? Your collars are up. Get with it. This is a fad in Seoul. What? I'm just worried. About what? Girls in Seoul will all chase after you. Eunji, you're more beautiful than most girls in Seoul. All they have is makeup. Have a good day. Go home now, I'll see you. I'll see you soon, okay? You have to let go. There's nothing in it. Let go. The train's here. Let go. I'm leaving to better my life. What are you doing? Come on, please. Eunji, let go. Minje, Minje. Don't worry. Just go home. I'll come back looking good, Minje so don't worry and go home Eunji, don't worry and just go, okay? I'll be waiting for you. Just go now. I'll be waiting for you. Hey Axe, didn't I tell you to get out of my way? Come on, just let me go. Let me go! Boss, I'm here. Boss! It's me, Minje. Relax. Calm down and come sit. What did you tell me when we first met? You said you wanted to live in style, right? And that's why you said you wanted to become a gangster. And now you want out? You'll just leave us? Why? I thought I'd live in style if I worked for you. But evidently, there's no style. I want to end my thug life here. So then what? What will you do? I'm going to become a philanderer. I'm going to seduce rich women and get them to pay up. You may go now. Boss! Just go. Thank you, boss. One more thing, Minje. I could care less if you become a philanderer or a playboy. Just don't tell anyone you worked for me. It's a goddamn shame. Boss, you sure you should let him go like that? He's a catch, but he's no thug material. The kid has too much heart. Sister dear... Love is eternal. Imagine if there were no love in our lives. I just can't stand people that try to buy love. Sister. Yeah? You believe in love, right? Thanks. What for? You're right. Love is eternal. I must've lost it. My husband didn't hit me out of hate. It was probably all out of love. And he probably stomped on me without knowing that it was me. He probably knew. Thanks to you, I regained my rationality. Thank you so much. No, you see... Have a good life, honey. Sister. It's way too late. I need to go fix him dinner. Wait, I didn't have dinner either. Hell. You're no good as a philanderer. You should become a marriage counselor. Shut up. You need to stop that love bullshit. Just get straight to the point. And look, if you're trying to play the game, You don't want to be all nice. Get to the point. I got some good stuff. Wanna check it out? Thought I almost had it this time. It doesn't Heot to look. Hey, Dongshik. I'm just trying to be a humane philanderer, you know. I mean, being a philanderer is a servicecentric profession. But then we got all these inhumane suckers, you know. Especially for you two, I'm willing to offer you the best, and the most advanced, you know? Get out. For almost nothing. I said, leave. Good day. Just watch. I'll get another chance. Sure. That's what dreams are for. I'm telling you. I'll find someone, hit it big, and live in style. You'll see. Hey, Dongshik. I'll show you how it's done today. She's mine. It'd be great if you could help, but if not, I have a plan. Just remember when you first came to our store. If I blurt it out, you know your old man won't be happy. We'll talk over a drink. What an honor to be getting a drink from Hemi. That's for your medical bill. If you're thinking the old Hemi, think again. I make a call, you're dead. Keep calling if you want money for medical bills. I can't pay you a penny other than medical expense. You bitch! Since when did you... turn all arrogant and condescending. You damn whore! Who the hell are you? Damn... Let's run, ma'am! Get him! It should be safe here. This place is temporarily closed. You're all wet. Ma'am, if it weren't for me today, you would've gotten in big trouble. Choi back there... he's known for beating women. Anyway, he must've really loved you, huh? Stupid bastard. Ma'am, love is eternal. Imagine if there were no love in our lives. You believe in love, right? Ma'am! Well... uhhh... You! all you do is rip off women? I don't rip off anything. You said you would go hit it big in Seoul. And all you are is a philanderer? What did you used to tell me? Wait, because you'll be back? It's been five years since you left. Eunji. It's really you, huh? Wait a second. Is it really you? Was it that hard to make a call? No... I never crossed your mind? Of course, I did. I thought you were dead. You know what, it would've been better if you were dead. What's this now? Well... I thought of killing myself. But it's me we're talking about. You know, Yun Minje. Remember? I wanted to hit it big and live with you till death do us part. Has it really been five years? One thing though, do you have to be that rude to me? What's wrong, Eunji? I'm OH Hemi. The Eunji you know died five years ago. What? Eunji? Hey, Eunji. Eunji, you can't just leave like this. Let's talk and catch up. Hey, Eunji. Locked, huh? Hey, roll down the window for a sec. Eunji! Come on, roll down the window! I swear on this snow. I'll be back in a year on a snowy day like today. Eunji! Don't worry. Just go home. I'll come back looking good, so don't worry and go home. Eunji, don't worry and just go, okay? Let me get another bottle please. That's enough. I won't put it on the tab, don't worry. Sir, how about a shoe shine? No thanks, I'm good. Come on, I'll shine them real good. Give it a try. I said, no thanks. Come on, you know you want it. I got some good stuff here. Want to take a look? I'll make it shine like a mirror. It doesn't Heot to look. You bastards. Don't you see I'm trying to get some reading done? Hold on, who might this be? Do you know me? I had dreams about you, and you don't remember me? I think you're mistaken. You're Gwangpal from Kyungsang province alright. It's me. WANG Dochul from Cholla. I'm not CHO Gwangpal. Hey, lowlife. You ruined my life and you don't remember me? You stinking bastard. Relax, Dochul, will you? It really wasn't my fault. I got the stuff all for you. I didn't know that it would have sideeffects like that. Dochul, I'm trying to move on with my life now. I even have a wife with a baby inside. So you were living happily while my family was getting screwed. No, man. I'm barely getting by. You bastard! Do you know what happened to my dick after I took the pills you sold me? It won't get hard and it's been sleeping ever since. It's sleeping? It won't get up. Really? No more erection. None? I turn impotent overnight. My wife hits it off with this guy next door. I'd have to kill you to make up for what I've been through. Anyway, you're dead today. Come here! Hey, drugs cause different reactions on different people. What? Don't come near me. I'm gonna run. How fast do you run a hundred meters? Thirteen seconds. I can do that in twelve seconds flat. I ask for your mercy, man. That's not happening. Damn! You stinking bastard! Congratulations, sir! Colonel, it's about time you find the right woman, sir. Your nephew's had enough hard work. That's right. That's right. tell him to come in. Is someone here? They sent someone from the 32nd division. Isn't that the Samchung Revival Camp? I guess he's in a Heory for relocation. Captain Hwang from 32nd division, sir. Happy birthday, sir. Leave your gift there and leave. Hey, where are you from? What, sir? Where were you educated? United Armed Forces academy, sir. UAF? No wonder he's running errands with a captain rank. I don't think where you come from is important as a soldier. How dare you... Wait, wait... Then, what do you think is important? It's one's patriotism for his country, sir. That's respectable. I should have someone like that under me. Since you came, have some dinner before you go. This is no place for him to join. No, no. Since you're here already, eat before you go. Wash your face with this. There's a guest. He said he was a hometown friend. Eunji. Holy cow. What brings you here? You can go now. This house is awesome. What's this here? Are you crazy? Where do you think this is? What? I'm just here to visit an old friend. What happened to you? Did you find a gold mine or something? How did you find me? It's not too hard. How many people in Korea do you think drive fancy cars like that? Hey, Eunji, those are all expensive stuff, huh? Are theses antiques? Eunji, are these real gold? You found a gold mine, didn't you? With just a few of these, you could live in style. You want them? Of course. Then take them. Really? You sure I can take these? As long as you don't get caught. Who's going to catch me? Don't you want to know who the owner is? No. It's someone that can easily kill any one of us instantly. Then don't tell him. Then take them. I'm really taking them, okay? What the hell, why not? Hell with it. I'm not taking them. If I take them and go into hiding, they'll never find me as you said. But then, what's going to happen to you? You said the guy can kill any one of us, so that includes you too, right? I'm okay, but you shouldn't get Heot because of me. You look really good. Look at where you're living. You have a slick car and everything. Don't get in trouble because of me. You need to learn, girl. Anyway, this is some style we got here. What brings you home at this hour? I was nearby. Just wanted to get changed. Ummm... the thing is... Take my clothes first. Are you still smoking? What did I tell you? I said bad habits are better rid than done! Once you taste something new, you forget the value of the old. Don't go anywhere and stay home. Eunji. Eunji, look, you okay? Eunji. Just go. What's going on? talk to me. Just go. Eunji, wake up. What's going on? please go. You're in danger, go. Eunji. I'm begging you. Just leave. You can't stay here. Just go. Eunji. please. Come on, go. please go. You gotta go. Go. Minje, go. So you're home, huh? Remember me? You know, the day you threw noodle soup at me. Look at what you did. How is it? Looks good, right? Why don't you try running again? Now that I know where you live. couldn't you forgive me? You little lame ass. My dick's dead. So now it's your turn. You dog! They call me bulldog. Dear... Stop right there! Stop, you fool! Stop! I said, stop. Stop. Get him! Hey! Move! Sir, listen. please help. What are you two? Excuse me. I just need to get him. So just do as you were. Come here. what? I just have a personal business with this guy to take care of. Come here! Crazy nuts. I think your expression is a little excessive. Don't you know where this bus is headed to? This bus is going to the Samchung Revival Camp. Fine. Just take me anywhere, but here. I don't care what camp it is, just take me. Revival sounds good. You bastard. Either you let the both of us go, or take both of us. I'm not leaving this bus without him. Stinking bastards. Kill them! Do you like it? You can never leave me unless I dump you. Eunji! Are you crazy? What are you doing here? Follow me. I'm sorry. Only if I hadn't showed up. It Heot a lot, right? What does he do anyway? Why do you have to live with a guy like that? Two years after you left for Seoul, everyone in town left because an army base was moving in. That's when Butcher Palbong offered to find you for me in Seoul. And? The day we came to Seoul, Palbong sold me to a Geisha house and left. Palbong... damn bastard...scum. It's all my fault. Then I was introduced to this soldier who said he could find you. He said he could find you for sure. I was stupid for believing him. If I had known the shore was this close, I would've came already. It's great here. Thank you god for finding Minje. Eunji. Hey. Eunji! Eunji! Eunji! Are you here for Hemi? She's been shocked by a sudden external impact. She needs to rest. What now? What about it? Isn't it pretty? It doesn't sting? For me. I'll go with this one. Get him the butterfly just like me. Butterflies aren't for men. But it's something to remember me by when you go to Seoul. Christ... Well then. This one's okay, I guess. Happy? Why do you have to cry like that? Okay, okay. Let me get the same one. Minje. They said you'll be okay if you get some rest. I'm really not the old Eunji. I've changed a lot. That's okay, Eunji. Can you forgive me? You didn't do anything wrong. There's nothing to forgive. I'm the one that should be asking for forgiveness. Can you keep a promise? Don't go anywhere and let's run away together. Okay, okay. I won't ever leave you until death do us part. You said you liked the sea, right? We'll live in a place with a sea view. I'm talking about where we're going to live. With huge palm trees and a hammock, sipping freshly squeezed juice. That's right! We'll put up a camp fire and cook up rabbit like before. Let's do that, okay? Let's live like that, Eunji. Sit. Yes, sir. Why did you want to see me? I want to become one of your men, colonel. What did you say was the most important thing as a soldier? I said patriotism, sir. Then, where should you be showing your patriotism to? My country, sir. Your country, huh? Let me ask that again. Where should you be showing your patriotism to? You, sir. Hey! You're really giving me these clothes, right? Yes. Are you serious about leaving? You don't need to know. I'm going to go live in style with Eunji in a remote place. Live happily ever after, you son of a bitch. I'm out. See ya. Yun Minje. Take him. What's wrong? What is it? What the hell? Get off of me. What are you doing? Let's go. Hey, Dongshik. What's wrong? Off of me. Dongshik, Dongshik! What is this? No, I'm not. Yun Minje. Odaesan crime family member. Okay, okay. I'm one of them, are you happy now? Now let me go. Eunji's waiting for me. I said Eunji's waiting for me, you son of a bitch! Hey, Dochul, I guess this is it. I feel like I'm back in the army. It can't be as bad as the army. You never know. I bet this place is way worse than the army. As far as I know it could be worse than the army. Look at their eyes, man. Did I ask you? I'm just trying to be nice to you boys. Show some respect, will you? Who do you think you are? what? Hey, dipsticks. Just shut the hell up. What are you on a picnic? Damn. You suckers. You'll repeat what I say. Trainee rule of conduct Number one. I'll do as told. One, I'll do as told! Two! I'll take all beatings. Two, I'll take all beatings! Three! I'll eat as served. Take off everything you're wearing except your skin and bone. You have ten seconds. Execute! Execute! Take off your watches, necklaces, and rings. Freeze! Freeze! You will salute the commander with 'allegiance'. Salute like a man, and bellow forth your 'allegiance'. Got that? Yes, sir! Now only put on your pants. Execute! Salute to the commander. allegiance! allegiance! allegiance! At ease. Most of you were delinquents in the real world. Our society will no longer tolerate people like you. With regards to this, the army has decided to help you revive into a worthy human being. The program will last for weeks with its focus on rebuilding your body, spirit, and mind. I'm Captain HWANG Giduk, your unit commander. I hope you'll follow your instructors' lead without trouble. Salute to the commander. allegiance! allegiance! Stay still! Can you please leave that? Shut up. Can't believe you're cutting it. I said, shut up. It Heots. Next. You don't have anything to cut, scum. Dreaming of Miss Yang from Daemyung adult barbershop. Shut up and get out. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're dead once we're out of here. You think they'll let us out to eat? How the hell can you be' hungry right now? You stupid bastard. I'm cold and hungry, man. Shit. Patience, Reflection, Patience, Reflection, Patience, Reflection, Patience, Reflection, Hemi? Who are you? I'll explain that to you later. I have something to tell you. You know Minje, right? You know, Yun Minje. That's right. A bunch of soldiers dragged him away that day and next thing I know, I get this notice in the mail. But you see, the Samchung Revival Camp is supposed to be way more than four weeks of revival training. They say it could take anywhere from six months to a year. Once you're in, they don't let you out safe can prepare about ten grand, he may be able to work something out. You know, that's the money. For about a thousand, he said. But I just can't afford for that money so I come here to... Get out. If it's too much five is good. I said, get out. Well then maybe two grand? Get the hell out! Want me to get out? I should've gone with two grand from the start, shit. Man, I was too greedy. Is this a butterfly? That's a pretty sorry butterfly. Stay still. Boss is trying to take in the art work. Go away. Go away? You damn... Do you have a death wish? You disgusting flab of meat. Hey, why would you wanna bother this scrawny kid? Get off, you fat jackass. You okay? You don't look like you belong here. What brought you here? No way. You were a gangster? You? How scary. What's your name? Yun Minje. I'm WANG Dochul. Think of me as your big brother from now on. As long as I'm here, you don't need to worry. I got your back. Hey, listen. If any of you gets near my boy here, I won't leave you alone. You got that, or what? What's wrong with those guys? Damn. Come on, move. Wash what you can for the next one minute. Come on, Heory up now. Over there, sir. How are you Captain Hwang? Sorry for intruding like this. That's okay, Hemi. What brings you here? My cousin's in the camp. Oh, so he's a soldier? No, the police had some things mixed up and brought him here. I was thinking maybe you could help. If it's your cousin wouldn't it be a lot easier if you ask the colonel. Well, the thing is... The Corp commander is paging you, sir. Hey, I'm sorry. I need to be excused. Hold on, wait. What's his name? Minje. Yun Minje. He should be out safe in four weeks. Can I see him now? I'm sorry. Visitings are prohibited. But, let me see what I can do. Thank you. And one more thing...

I told him that you were my cousin, so act accordingly Got that? Okay. You should be out in no time. Okay. Allegiance! If it's okay, I'd like to take you out to dinner.

What about me? What are you doing, you idiot. Sir, one sec! I think there's been a mistake. My name wasn't called. Number 2126, Yun Minje. There's no Yun Minje. Is that clear? There definitely is. That's impossible! There definitely is! You jerk. I need to get out! I need to get out, you bastards! I need to get out! Freeze! This is where you boys will be staying starting today. There's no agenda for today. After six months of volunteer work, you'll be sent home. It's been a while. I have one little question I wanted to ask you. What is it? Did you know that Samchung Revival Camp was like this? I didn't have a clue. So you didn't know, huh? You stinking bastard! What's with you? You got me into this. Off of me. What do we do now, huh? What now? Stop crying. Leave him alone. I feel him. Shut the hell up. You are a living nightmare. Whatever man...it's you that got us on the bus here What did you just say? Hey. WANG Dochul, you. Shut up. Who the hell is this now? Okay, so you wanna test my patience today, huh? Okay then, let's go. Come here you little punk What? I said, come here. He doesn't understand that. You need to call him as if you would a dog. You bitch. Do you wanna die? Do you boys have a death wish? I own a barbershop. One day, this cop came in for a hair cut and a hand job. Then he would leave without paying. So I said he should at least pay the chick for the hand job. Just for saying that, he tried to arrest me. So I beat the crap out of the cop, and that's how I ended up here. I may be a mere barber, but I can never stand injustice. During the Park administration, I used to be a Navy Seal, you know. Anyway, after Park's death, things just got tangled up. KIM Jegyu's a bastard for assassinating President Park That was just foul, you know. Enough! Sit! Next. Number 3202. Load personal story! Load! Fire! I'm a doctor. And I chose to come here. Bullshit. Please listen to my story. I used to roam around the country practicing medicine to help out the needy. I worked gruelingly to serve my patients with utmost care. But one day, I met this woman who was suffering from a clogged artery. Why is that a big deal? Well, if you don't prevent the artery from being clogged, the artery will expand and eventually result in death. The good thing is, I knew the proper cure for the disease and so I slid my rod in her clam, attempting to save her life. But ignorant people thought that I was trying to rape her, which in turn got her husband furious. So I decided to go into hiding. The end. Go into the cathedral. It's freezing out there. Man, I need to get out of here before my son sees birth. But guess that's not happening anytime soon. Son? He's just going to turn into a thief like you anyway. Shut up. His mother's smart, so he'll probably get the brains from her. Yeah, whatever. Like father like son. How smart do you think he can possibly be? Besides, your wife's probably banging some guy left and right. Shut up, you loser! If you talk about Mija again, I'm going to kill you. Mija...? That's right. WANG Mija. Now that I come to thin of it, she has the same last name as you. She's really something though. Did you say, WANG Mija? Yeah. What does she do for a living? She's a hair stylist. So it's WANG Mija that cuts people's hair? Yeah, man. She has a mole here? And how do you know this? You stinking bastard... that's my sister. Oh, so you're the Yunger brother that ran away after getting expelled from school? Holy mother lord. Oh my god. This stinking bastard and my sister... How dare you...you stinking... So you're my brother in law. That's fantastic, brother. You're my brother in law for real. Nice meeting you, man. Please cut that out, will you? That crazy son of a bitch. Why would you want to take off his pants, you homos? Are you out of your mind? Damn right. Freeze! What's going on here? Cut out the crap. I'll give you another chance. Back to sleep. No violence, gentlemen! Thank you, Minje, Mr. Be nice to our new boss now. We'll call him Mr. Butterfly. If you don't call him that, I'll kick all your asses. Good night, boss. Can you tell me where Minje is? Why didn't you tell me the truth from the beginning? Your relationship with Yun Minje. I didn't mean to lie. What good is it for you if you know where he is? Please help. I just need to find him. Please tell me. He's not for you. Why not? Because he's a gangster? It's not like I'm any better. I'm just a mistress. Don't degrade yourself like that. I love Minje. I don't buy that love. I don't care what you think. What I need is knowing where he is right now. Please. Okay, fine. But I'll closely be watching the love you just talked about. We searched everywhere but couldn't find anything. But I did issue a warrant. We should be able to find her soon. Forget about it. I know what a man like you wants. And I have the power to give that to you. But the question is, what can you give me? Leave it up to me. Should I? I already swore my patriotism to you, sir. Give me a chance. That dude... Why the hell is he here? Attention! You were all given an opportunity for revival at the Samchung Revival Camp. But you were all sent here because you didn't make it there. You gentlemen must change. If you don't get better here, you won't have another chance. And the entire unit will take responsibility for one's action. If one messes up, the rest will be disciplined. And if one of you decides to betray the group for personal benefit, I'll teach you why it was a bad choice. Prepare yourselves. The end. He's changed completely. He was nicer than that before. From what I'm seeing, I guess he messed up. Or else, he wouldn't be here, right, brother? Don't call me brother before I kick your ass. You need to accept our relationship. Shit. Settle down, brother. As long as I'm here, there will be no more fighting. I'll teach you discipline from now. Get started. Yes, sir. Authorized personnel only, miss. How about visits? I said, authorized personnel only, miss. Do you know Yun Minje? Does anyone know Yun Minje? Anyone? Anyone know Yun Minje? Hold on. Hold on. Wait! You can't go in. It's the same butterfly tattoo as this. tattoo as this. You know Yun Minje? Yun Minje? She was calling out your name, boss. And she had the same butterfly tattoo as you. Eunji?! Eunji! Stop! Minje, be careful! No, Minje! Boss! Eunji! Eunji! Minje! Eunji, what are you doing here? Are you okay, Minje? I'm okay. You sure? Go back now. I'm okay. Minje... Don't worry and just go, Eunji! Minje, I... I'm going to you later. Minje... Minje! Minje! You dip shit! Don't hit him! Please stop! Please just give me one second. She came here to see me, okay? Minje. Just a minute, please. Don't hit him! I was hoping that you wouldn't show up. What are you doing here? Did the colonel send you here? I'm sorry. It's all my fault. So, can you please save him? I'm begging you. He didn't do anything wrong It's all me. Let him go. This is my last warning. Don't ever come back here. Will you let him go, if I leave then? You're going to kill him, aren't you? Do you think I'm here to kill Yun Minje alone? Hey, Sergeant, get her out of here. Yes, sir. If you see her again, get rid of her. Hey! Do you think she's still here? Of course man. She's boss' woman. She didn't look like she was going to leave anytime soon. What a kiss ass you are What's Mr. Butterfly to you? Are you talking shit about boss? Well, if you think about it, butterflies may look fancy but in reality they're really a lonely and poor species. You need to live as larva for six years underground. And for what? So that you can fly for maybe a couple of weeks? With bad luck, you can even get hit by a rain shower on your first day. They're some poor species. So no larvas for snack when you boys are out of here. Got that? What about the broth? That you can. Larva broth with a shot of Soju is the best. Shut the hell up. How can you be talking about Soju and larvas right now? Hey, you little coldblooded. Eunji... Eunji? Eunji... How did you get here? How did you escape? I knew that you would be here. Minje, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I think all of this happened because of me. Stop saying that. I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. It's dangerous here. Let's go, okay? Let's go. Minje! Minje! No, no. Please don't shoot. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Please don't shoot! Take him. No! Please, no! Let Eunji go, you bastards! Don't touch her! Eunji! Minje... Minje... Let her go. What about her, sir? Put her in my car. Off of me! Go back to the corps. Allegiance! Out! Get out! Off of me! You're not even human! That's right, I'm a soldier. My duty is to kill all enemies. Foreign and domestic. And Yun Minje is an enemy. If he dies, so will I. Wake up! Why would you want to risk your life for a scum like that? I never disobeyed higher order up until now. But you smiled at me when everyone was laughing. You acknowledged me as a soldier when no one did. Yun Minje would've been dead a long time ago if it weren't for you. I never asked you to sacrifice. Where's Eunji? Where's Eunji? Where's Eunji, you twirp? Please don't shoot. I'm back. So don't shoot. Hey, brother. So you're back, huh? So you ran and couldn't go farther than a kilo? Eunji had it in her hands. Where was it, huh? Heads! CHO Gwangpal! CHO Gwangpal! You can't die! Let's run away! If I'm going to die, I want to die in style. Mr. Butterfly! Mr. Butterfly! Reload the magazine! Sir, there's no more! Out of my way! Is it Yun Minje? I'll gather a search team right away, sir. Eagle, Eagle, Tiger. We have a problem. Backup needed. Inform the location, and contain this mess. Eunji. Eunji! Eunji! Eunji! Eunji! Get up. I'm here. It's me, Minje. Come on, Eunji. I'm here. Eunji, you can't die like this Eunji, you can't die like this. What happened to our promise that we'd live on the beach with palm trees and a hammock drinking juice. I thought we were going to live happily ever after just like that. Eunji, this can't happen. We need to live together in style, remember? Wake up, Eunji! Wake up. Come on! Why did you kill her? Why? You scum! Why did you kill her? Why did you kill her? Did you have a wedding and everything with my sister? Of course. At this huge wedding chapel in Namwon. Did she look good? Brother! You know damn well how good she looks. You know damn well... At least Mr. Butterfly's with his woman. Good thing he'll be with his love. I mean, it's a long way.
