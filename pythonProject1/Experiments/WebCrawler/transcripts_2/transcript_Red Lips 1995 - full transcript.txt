Now, remember you have to wait at least six weeks before you can sell blood again. - Shit, I need more than this. It's not enough. - Well, I hope we see more of you here. You know, you have an extremely rare blood type. - Well, you can have some more right now if you want to. I could use some another 15 bucks. - But I'm afraid that's against the rules. We have to wait a full six weeks before we can accept blood from the same person again. - And I bet you're a real stickler for the rules, right? - Well, I can't accept another blood donation now, but you could be of great service to this clinic and be paid generously for the effort. - How generously? - How does a hundred dollars a day sound to you? - A hundred dollars a day? You're shittin' me, right? - We can begin now if you want to. - Well, what do you want to do? - Just let me run a few simple tests. You see, for these sort of tests, young women of your age range make the best subjects. And if we begin now, we could be finished by the evening and you'll be a hundred dollars richer. - Hey, let's go. What's in that? - Just a type of vaccine. I wanna test your body's reaction to it. It was designed to stimulate the body's defense mechanism to make the human organism literally invulnerable against disease, fatigue. When I perfect the serum, the human life expectancy may be stretched by 20, 30, maybe even 50 years. And if my tests are successful, you'll be the first to benefit. - I don't know about all that, but as long as you keep the cash coming, I'll be back. - I'm sure you will. - Are you okay, ma'am? Are you sure you're okay, ma'am? You know there's a drugstore down the street if you wanna get something to put on that. It could get infected. - No, no, I'm all right. - Okay, you're the boss. All right, I tried to help. - When I left here, I felt kind of sick. A kind of nausea, I guess. - That's perfectly natural. Your body is adjusting to a new chemical component, but in a few days, my serum will be completely absorbed into your blood and then you should feel completely fine. - But it was more than just stomach pains. Something else happened. I cut my leg when I fell on some broken glass and when I looked at the blood, I felt a strange kind of hunger. I wanted to taste the blood. - Interesting. And did you? - Did I? - Did you taste the blood? - Yes. And when I did, the pain was gone. Isn't that strange? - Well, not necessarily. Sometimes the mind makes subconscious associations between psychological trauma and something more tangible, physical. I'm sure that's all it was. There, the serum's ready. I'm slightly increasing your dosage today. Soon I'll know if my experiment is a success. - This is awful. - Is there anything wrong here? - Yeah. This tastes like shit. - Well, we haven't had any complaints. - Well, I'm complaining. This isn't fit to drink. - Well you still owe me two bucks. You're gonna pay for it. - Here. I hope you fuckin' choke on it. - I don't have to stand for this kind of talk. You get outta here. - I don't know what kind of dive this is, but it's no restaurant. See ya. - She looks like she's psycho. Nicole, do we have to stand around here all night? I wanna go home. - Yeah? Well, if you go, it'll be your loss. You know who's staying here, don't you? - No, and I really don't care. - You don't care that Irwin R. Stone is supposed to be here? Stone Productions? The movie producer? Is any of this sinking in, Robin? - So what? You think he's gonna put you in his next movie? Just gimme five minutes with the fat bastard. I'll be under a contract before his pants hit the floor. - That's what I like about you, Nicole. You're so humble. - Modest, too. That's why guys shit themselves over me, 'cause I'm a lady. That's him. - You sure? - Look. This picture, it's him. - Well, I guess it looks like him. - This is it. Wish me luck. - Well, are you gonna get me a part in the movie too? - Who am I, Robin? Your agent? Mr. Stone. - Yes? - I can't believe it's really you. I heard you might be staying here, so, well, here I am. - You certainly are, aren't you? - I hope you don't think I'm being too forward. - No, no, no, no, no. I'll tell you what, I'll bet you're a friend of Mel's aren't you? - Mel? Oh yeah. Sure. You know, Mel thought you might hit it off. What do you think? - I think Mel's a hell of a guy. A hell of a guy. I'll tell you what, I bet you you could use a refreshment and guess what? I have a brand new bottle of Boone's Farm up in the room. - Boone's Farm? Oh, that's my favorite. Maybe we could slip on back up? - Okay. Okay. Well here we are. I'll tell you what, why don't you relax and I'll pour us a tall glass of vino. - Mr. Stone, I didn't know you spoke Italian. You're so cultured. - I've got plenty of surprises up my sleeves. - Maybe so, but it's not what's up your sleeve I came to see. - Mm, that sounds good. Why don't you just relax and let me get that glass of wine and we'll be ready to loosen up. So, uh, what do you do for a living? - Oh, I'm an actress. A very good actress. - Really? You think I might have seen you in anything? - That depends. Did you see Alien Egg Layers? I was the nude alien queen. - You were? - Then I had a cameo in Hell Camp as the nude swimmer. I'm killed in the pre-credit sequence, so you might have missed me. - I think I saw that one on cable, but I'm still trying to place you. - Does this jog your memory? - Yeah. Yeah, it does. In fact, you look really, really good. - Do you remember the scene in Alien Egg Layers when I lure the handsome earth stud to my spaceship for breeding experiments? - No, I don't think I saw that one. - Let's pretend we're on the set and the director yells action. - Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I could be up for some action. - I bet you can picture me in your next film, can't you? That's what my whole career has been leading up to, to star in an Irwin R. Stone production. - Irwin? My name's Murray. What are you talking about? - You're not Irwin R. Stone, the film producer? - No, I'm Murray J. Stone, the carpet salesman. - I don't believe this. Oh God, I almost fucked a carpet salesman. - Hey, salesman of the year. - You're no salesman, you rapist! - What do you mean rapist? I didn't touch you. - I've got to find Robin. She's probably met the real Stone. He's probably giving her my part. Robin, Robin! - Hey, listen. I don't care what that girl told you, I didn't touch her, I didn't rape her. - I know that. I've been watching you. - And you might as well know, too. I'm not a big Hollywood producer. I'm just a carpet salesman that's here from Jersey. Salesman of the year, but- Hey you okay? - I think I'm sick. - You're sick? - I need you to help me. - Come here, lay down. Lay down here. You need something to drink? - That's why I came. To drink. - Here. Not wine. - I got a couple beers left over. You want a beer? - A little closer. I need to drink… - What is going on in here? I'm trying to get some sleep. What's wrong with you? You're covered in blood, stay away from me! - Your color looks much better today, Caroline. - You think so? - Absolutely. I think my serum is having an effect. Wouldn't you agree? - I think it is, doctor. Do you have my hundred dollars? - I know, business first. We better get busy. I have a whole series of tests to run on you today. - I want to show you something first. - Really? - Ever since last night, I now know what that serum is doing to me. - It's making you stronger. It's creating the ultimate immune system in your body. Soon there will be no disease or sickness that can affect you. - But there's something else. It's given me a strange appetite. Do you want me to show you, doctor? - You can wait to eat after I'm through with these experiments. - But I want to show you now so you'll understand. So you'll understand what's happening to me. - Caroline, you don't know what you're doing. - I think I do, doctor. - Caroline, you're not feeling well. - I'll be all right, doctor. After I've eaten. - You look like you need some company. - Not- - Come on, honey. - Not tonight, honey. - Oh, no… - No, I'm in a hurry tonight. - No, you're going with us tonight. - No, not tonight. - Let's go. - I can't tonight. No, no. No come on, I'm busy tonight. Come on. No, get away. Look, find somebody else. Come on. - Come on, come with us. - What's wrong with that guy? - What a jerk. Let's go find somebody else. - All right, yeah. Forget that guy, he's an idiot. - We'll find somebody else. - We're find real one. Hey, what do you think her problem is? - I don't know. Hey lady, this isn't a hotel. God, she's had a lot more to drink than we have. - She looks like she needs to have some fun. - Maybe she can come with us. You wanna come and have some fun with us? A little drink, maybe? Come on, let's take her with us. She'll have a lot of fun. - Yeah, come on. We'll show you a real party. - We can party all night long. - I think this girl's been doing some partying herself. - Doing some serious drinking. - Some serious partying. - Let's go show her a good time. - Let's show her a real party. - Trust me, you'll be the life of the party. Just come with us. - Dumb white bitch! Jesus. - Forget about her. Now it's just me and you. - Not here. - Take me where you want. - Hello? Lisa. What happened? Why did you storm outta here? What's wrong? - Amy, look, there's no sense in even talking about it anymore. I'm not coming back. It's over. - No, don't leave me. Please, I promise it'll never happen again. No, please. One more chance. I, I, I, fucked up okay? Okay? No, I won't do it again! No, please, don't, don't leave me! - Yeah, that's what you said last time and you promised it the time before that. Look, I need some kind commitment. I need a real relationship. And if you can't give me that, well then we're finished. Look, I've got my things packed. I just need a place. I just need to get my life together, okay? Amy. Amy, it's over, okay? Goodbye. - Why did I do it? - What's wrong? Are you sick? - I'll be all right. - Are you sure? - I just feel kind of faint. - Oh my gosh. I, I'm sitting here watching you. Maybe you need a doctor. - No! No doctors. You have to promise. - Okay, no doctors. All right, maybe you're not as sick as I thought. - It's just, I'm so hungry. It's been so long since I've eaten. - Oh. Well we can take care of that. Come along with me. Come along with me. Let's go. - No, no. I appreciate you trying to help, but you can't. - Listen, listen. Hey, hey. Hey. You are getting off this street. Come with me. I don't want any arguments. Now come on. Oh great, thank you. Well, come on, you said you were starving. Help yourself. - I can't, really. It's not what I need. Look, you've been very nice, but I have to go. - I don't wanna be a bitch, but you're not leaving this table until you eat something, okay? You were so weak. You fainted twice. Now come on. It's not filet mignon, but it'll do for now. - Happy? - Well, it's a start. So, um, I need a place tonight. You wouldn't happen to know of any cheap motels, would you? - I happen to be an expert on cheap hotels. Although in New York, even a roach motel can cost $50 a night. - Oh, that's way over my limit. Well, I didn't expect to need a place tonight. I had a major breakup today and I walked out before knowing where I was gonna sleep. - Man trouble, huh? - No, more like girl meets girl, girl falls in love with girl, girl gets fucked over one too many times and walks out. - I see. Look, can you excuse me for a minute? - You're not gonna try and walk on me, are you? - I'll be right back. I promise. - I'll be waiting. - Come on, Lisa, let's go. - Did you get enough to eat? - I'm stuffed. I know a great club a few blocks from here. You wanna go? - Well you seem to be feeling better. - Yeah, I feel great. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Oh look at that hat. I would never wear that. - You'd look great in that. - Oh, no. - Oh, sunglasses. - What do you think? Don't those look good on her? Can I borrow that for a second? Take a look. - Those look really nice. - Okay, let's go. - Is that the way it is now? You're calling the shots? - That's right, and I don't need you breathing down my neck anymore. If I feel like going to a club, I'm going, all right? I don't need your permission. - Nobody fucks with my business, fuckin' bitch. - You guys need two? - Yeah. - Thanks a lot for letting us stay at your place, Gina. - Oh it's no problem. We're almost there. So how long have you two known each other? - Well, we actually- - Lisa and I go way back. Sometimes it feels like we've know each other forever. ♪ Because of the wonderful things he does ♪ - Wow, this is really a great place. - Oh, thanks. Look, I can sleep over here on the couch if you two girls wanna take the room. - Well, I guess that's up to Caroline. - That'll be fine, Gina. I hope nobody wants to get up early tomorrow. I feel like I could sleep all day. - Ooh, you mean you're a night person? - That's how it seems to work out. When the sun is out, I just want to curl up and hide. Don't you feel like that sometimes? - Well, I've been known to sleep until noon if that's what you mean. Of course, I don't have any real reason to get up at all tomorrow. As of tonight, I'm officially unemployed. - So you don't have to start looking for another job tomorrow? - Don't rush me. - I wanna savor a little freedom first. - I know what you mean. I feel like I'm starting over, but you know what? It's not so bad when you have friends. - I don't know why I'm even going to bed. I'm not even tired. - You were acting half dead this afternoon. Are you sure you feel okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. Really. - You know, this afternoon, I was feeling like I didn't have a friend in this town. Well… I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm just really glad I met you, Caroline. - You know, I haven't had anyone really care about me in a long time. There's been no one to count on. - Yeah. - You got me. So can I have a goodnight kiss? - I just brought an extra blanket. It might get cold. - Thanks, Gina. Goodnight. - Goodnight. That was too funny. Do you see the look on her face? - Yeah. - Caroline? Caroline? - Don't look at me. I don't want you see me. - Caroline, oh my god, you're covered in blood. - I didn't want it to be you, Lisa. I couldn't help it. I needed someone. - Caroline, what are you talking about? - I need blood. I have to have it to live. You don't what I am. You don't know what they did to me! - Who Caroline? I don't understand. - The clinic. The clinic. They made me this way. Everyday it gets worse. If I don't drink blood, I feel like I'm dying. Every day, I have to have it! I can't help it. - Its not your fault. Caroline- - You can't stay with me! - Whoever did this to you, it's not your fault. - If 1 go too long without it, I might lose control. I might, I might even hurt you. - No, no, look, we'll get through this together. Caroline, I'm not leaving you. - You don't know what I am! - Caroline, I care about you. We'll get through this together. Look, in the clinic, whatever they did to you, we'll go back there and we'll make them undo it. - No! No. I'm not going back. I'm not going back. They'll kill me if I go back. - Okay. - Promise me. - All right, look. I promise. - You won't take me back there. - I promise, I wouldn't do anything to hurt you. All right, look, no one knows that we're here. We can just stay here for a few days, okay? - What about her? - Oh geez. Well, we'll just have to get rid of her. Look, I tell you what we're gonna do. Look, you just go back to bed and you just get some rest, okay? All right? Look, I'm gonna take care of this. - Lisa! Lisa! Where is Gina, Lisa? - I told you I'd take care of it. I just want to protect you. I just want to take care of you. - You are so good to me. - I love you, Caroline. - And I love you, Lisa. - I love you. - Oops, where's the key? Okay. Oh. - Hm, let's see what kind of music you have. Play this. - Mm, picked a good one. ♪ Oh, the light's so bright ♪ ♪ And the nights are colder ♪ ♪ Yeah, there's no tomorrow ♪ ♪ My head's dizzy ♪ ♪ And nothing can kick my sorrows ♪ ♪ Oh, the lights are so cold ♪ ♪ Don't believe a single thing that I've told ♪ ♪ Oh, the light is so bright ♪ ♪ See if I can find my way back ♪ ♪ I'll, I'll rise again ♪ ♪ And I'll, I'll fall again ♪ ♪ I will ♪ ♪ I will rise again ♪ ♪ I, I will fall again ♪ ♪ The lights, oh they're so bright ♪ ♪ Maybe, maybe I can find my way tonight ♪ ♪ I'll, I'll rise again ♪ ♪ And I'll, I'll fall again ♪ ♪ You made a sound like a fight too many times ♪ ♪ To find no answers in all the places to grind ♪ ♪ Seeing all the boring videos ♪ ♪ I've been to that place ♪ ♪ I swear, I don't want to go ♪ ♪ And I'll, I'll rise again ♪ - Oh, Caroline. Oh, you came back. - I'm sorry, Lisa. But you know what happens when the hunger comes over me. I don't wanna be near you when that happens. I don't ever wanna hurt you, Lisa. - You won't. You won't. So how do you feel? Do you feel better, hm? - I'll be okay tonight. But every day I need someone. It's been like that ever since, ever since I left that hospital. - Who were they? What did they do to you? - I was desperate. I needed money. I went there to sell blood, you know, a quick 15 bucks. Back then, that seemed like all the money in the world. Anyway, they told me about these experiments they were doing and they needed young women. They paid a hundred dollars a day and I couldn't pass up money like that. So that was the first one, and ever since then I've had to do it again and again. Every day I need blood. Without it, I can't even describe the pain. When it hurts so bad, I'd kill anyone to make the pain stop. Make the pain stop. Please stop it. Make the pain stop. - Oh, you poor thing. - I mean, they're all dead. I mean, I'm just gonna keep on killing. I might as well just end it all. - No, Caroline, no. And I don't ever wanna hear you talk like that. Now we're gonna get through this together, okay? Now, whatever they did to you at that clinic, there's got to be a cure, but until then, I'm gonna help you. - You're gonna help me? - Yes. You need blood, we'll get you blood. Okay? - No- - It's the only way to keep you alive. - No, Lisa, I can't drag you into this. Lisa, you're the first person I've really cared about. - I care about you, Caroline, and that's why I'm gonna help you now. Now look, you're gonna need more blood tomorrow, okay? And I'm gonna help you get it. - Where? - Well, do you remember that nightclub you took me to last night? Do you remember there was a boy on stage with a singer? Well, I did some looking around today while you were gone and found out that he is very easy to get to know, okay? Now I even got his phone number and I think he would appreciate a phone call from one of his admirers. - What's his name? - His name is Nick. - Nick. Hello? Is this Nick? Oh, you don't know me, my name's Caroline. I caught your show at the club yesterday. I really enjoyed it. I thought you were incredible. Well, anyways, I was wondering maybe if you're not busy tomorrow, we might get together. I think I'd like to get to know you. Yeah, I think I can find it. See you then. Hey, you know, I really appreciate you letting me crash here. There's been a lot that's come up suddenly. - Oh, it's no problem. Everyone at that damn club's been crashing here lately. - Mm I see you've got a lot of interesting stuff here. - Yeah, but this one here doesn't have a name yet. It's just about exploring sexuality. It's got cocks and cunts and all that good stuff. This one here, it's called "Pipe Dreams.” It's about pregnant women who smoke crack. - I've always loved pregnant women. - And I've always loved crack. - I'm feeling kind of scruffy. Do you mind if I take a bath? - Sure, it's down the hall, but I don't have any clean towels. - That's okay. - How's it going in there? It's just me. Just came to see if you needed any help. - Here. You wanna make yourself useful? - That's right. Just step right on in. - What do you want? - I might ask you the same thing, both of you, but just so we get started off on a first name basis, my name is Tony and this is my girlfriend Gina's apartment. Now suddenly she's gone and you two have moved in. Now, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for all this. - We live here now. She doesn't even live here anymore. - Oh, so you live here now? I can see she's not here, but the landlord seems to think she still lives here. And who could blame him? After all, this is her furniture, these are her tapes. Even her clothes. I bought this one for her last month. $500. You telling me she left all this stuff behind? - Look, she's just gone, all right. You're not gonna find her here anywhere. - You seem to be awfully sure of that. - Leave her alone. - Maybe you can tell me where I can find her. - Just leave her alone! She doesn't know anything. - You know, I'm starting to really lose my fuckin' patience here. One of you better start talking and real quick. You think I'm bluffing? One shot and your girlfriend ain't got no face. Now, are you ready to tell me where Gina is? - Okay! Okay. We talked to her the night before last, but just for a little bit. - You talked to her? And she invited you to come over and take over her fucking apartment? - No. No, it's not like that. I guess we told her how we needed a place to stay. She said we could hang out here for a few days 'cause she was going out of town. - That's pretty fucking convenient, isn't it? Especially when little miss Gina is in to me for about two G's now. Maybe I didn't mention this in our little introductory, but Gina and I have a very professional relationship. She takes care of me and I take care of her. In other words, she's one of the highest paid pieces of ass in New York. Now Gina makes me a lot of money and nobody's going to stop that. Not you and definitely not you. - Well, we could just go. If you don't want us here, we'll just leave. - Oh, you'll just go? You think it's that simple? Maybe I didn't make myself perfectly clear, so let's try it like this: when Gina is not making me money, I am not happy. And when I am not happy, you better fuckin' believe you two are not going to be happy campers. You say Gina's coming back? All right, fine. But until she does, you're both working for me. You both look like you've got a couple of hot little bodies. Yeah. I bet there are plenty of guys that would pay big time for a crack at you two. So what do you say? - You can go to fuckin' hell. - I hope I didn't damage the merchandise too much. We might as well get comfortable. I think we're going to be seeing a lot of each other. - You just can't keep us here. - As long as I'm holding this, I think I can do whatever the fuck I want. Now you just help make your girlfriend beautiful. You both go to work in one hour and you're not coming back in here until I see $500 each. - You gonna be okay? - I'll all right. - Gina used to keep some pretty good chow around here if you bitches haven't cleaned it out. - No, no, no, please. Let me get that for you. I'll do it. - You just take care of your face, honey. I can take care of things in here. - Caroline, he's going into the kitchen. - What the fuck is this shit? This isn't Gina's. Those are Gina's rings… That's her fuckin' hand! Oh my God. You've cut her to pieces. Ah, stop! Get off of me! What are you doing? Get off of me! - Oh, god! Oh… - Lisa? Lisa! Lisa, you can't die on me. You can't die on me. Lisa, I love you. I love you, Lisa. Lisa! Lisa, don't die on me! I love you, Lisa. I love you. I love you. Lisa! Lisa… Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
