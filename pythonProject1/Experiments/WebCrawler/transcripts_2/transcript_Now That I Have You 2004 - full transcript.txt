foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- There are more than five billion people in this world. You may have encountered some of them already. You may have bumped into or spoken with some. Or perhaps you may not have noticed them at all. Whether you know them or not, each one of them has their own story. Their own joys and sorrows. But they all yearn for one thing. To give love, to fall in love, and above all, to be loved. To find that person who can give meaning to their life. Someone to be with through thick and thin. They will do everything just to find that person who is meant for them. They're willing to search anywhere just to find the one destined for their love. This is just one of the many stories about finding happiness and true love. Excuse me. Hello? Oh, my God... What's happening to you? He looked at me! Who? The guy on the train. Have you talked to him already? No, he just looked. Don't be so obvious! You've been eyeing that guy for a month now but... Are you crazy? You think I'm that cheap? I'm not like that, Stefi! And what do you think you're doing? I can't just approach him and introduce myself... So, you expect him to make the first move? But, Stefi, I'm a girl. He doesn't even know you exist! Betchay, you better do something about it now! You won't get anywhere by being demure! Hello? What are you looking at? ‪Excuse me. Oh, no... Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Make way, please. Where is he? -I'm really sorry! -Watch it! Here's a kiss! Bye! Taxi! -Excuse me. -Hey! This is our cab, okay? ‪Just an emergency. -Even if it is emergecy, this is our cab! -We don't care! I'm just dizzy... -Seriously? -My God... Thanks! I'm really sorry. Where to, miss? Sir? Do you really know which cab we're following? Yes, you pointed at it. But which one? There are three cabs in front of us! The white one. But they're all white! -Which one? -The one on the left... with yellow stripes. That's right. Keep following it. Don't let it run too far. -You want me to go near it? -Please don't! My goodness! -Just keep tailing it! Not be beside it. -Okay. Relax. -Hey, I'm driving! Relax! -Okay... -Okay. Just keep driving. -Relax. ‪-Okay, relax. ‪-Just keep tailing it. -Mike? -Yes? May I ask you a question? Why are you pouring alcohol on your desk? I ate a sandwich earlier. It might attract cockroaches. Mike, there are no cockroaches here. Well, they don't show up in the morning because they're sensitive to light. They usually come out when it's dark. -Don't you know that? -No. I don't have a pet cockroach... so there's no way for me to know that. By the way, your cousin is waiting for you outside. Dude, it's just a date, man. I'm not telling you to get her pregnant. Jacob, why do you always drag me to these dates? -I'm just doing this to help you. -Help me? With what? You know, Uncle Oscar and Auntie Lucille talked to me. What did they tell you? They don't mind that you don't have a girlfriend. They're worried that you don't have a girl at all! What's wrong if I can't find a girl who's... Hello! Come on, are you even looking for one? Okay, it's not my priority right now. You see? That's not normal. It's always a guy's priority to find a woman! -Just go back to your office. -Dude. You have to get over that girl. Who? Who else but your one and only girlfriend back in college! What's her name again? Katherine? The one you love so much, but she left you. That's not what happened. She just went to the States. -So, she did leave you! -Yes! I'm leaving now! What? You stalked him? I did not stalk him, I just followed him. -Hi, Betsy! -Hi! It's not stalking. I just did a bit of research. Is that the guy from the train? Well... Stefi told me to make the first move. And your idea of a first move is to scare him? He didn't see me. I was careful. Whatever. You know what your problem is? You listen to Stefi too much. If she's such an expert when it comes to guys, how come her relationships don't last long? You're confusing me. When I wasn't doing anything, you said I was stupid. Now that I'm trying to be aggressive, you think I'm crazy! -What do you want... -Hey! That hurts! I'm sorry. Betsy, I haven't met an accountant who's exciting. Well, he's different. Betchay, there are a lot of handsome guys out there. When I go out in Makati, I see a lot of cute guys! Tell me, where are they? Why are they all hiding from me? I've had enough, Stefi! I'm tired of dressing up every Friday and Saturday night... Excuse me! You put on makeup, go to a bar and smile, while you endure the stupidity of guys out there. You talk as if you go on a lot of dates. Is this okay? It suits you. Hey, try this one. Who's that? I bet it's your clingy girlfriend again. What's her problem? I thought she's supposed to be at work. Let me see! Well, she cares. -Like Care Bears? Hello? -Care Bears? -You know what? Oops, sorry! -Ouch! -That hurts, Betsy! -You know, Martin? There's nothing wrong with what Maritess is doing. But please tell her... she doesn't have to be jealous of us! -Why did you hurt me, Betsy? -Wait a minute. We're talking about your love life, not mine. -Excuse me. -Get off my back. Betchay has no love life except... for that accountant in her fantasies. -Correction. -Let's go this way! He only works in that building. -It doesn't mean he's an accountant. -Cute. Okay, if you're so sure about this guy, why don't you make a move already? Please answer. Stefi! Come on, Betsy! Let's face it, guys are getting fewer and fewer each day. And in this day and age, it shouldn't come as a shock to everyone that a girl makes the first move. So, what's your plan? I don't have one. ‪I'm still waiting for a sign. A sign? Yes, a sign. When the right man comes along, there will be a sign. That's what I pray for every night. Lord, give me a sign. Oh, well, the Lord can't answer you because he's busy. -He's out of town. -Yes. My goodness, Khalil got drunk again. Dad, what are you doing? Writing a letter for the newspaper. Another letter to the editor? I need to do this, dear. Take a look at this. Look. They published the last letter I sent... without any revisions! This was about the dumpsite in San Mateo. But Dad, what does that dumpsite have to do with you? Elizabeth, you need to be concerned about the issues in our country. Just take your mom for example. She dedicated her life to her countrymen. He's got the whole world in His hands He's got the flowers and the trees... It's instinct. As they say, if you have an instinct, there's truth to what you're feeling. Why don't you just ask your girlfriend? She's cheating on me! Ever since she started working, she has really changed... And when she met her boss from New York, she has changed even more! Friend Lord... you've always known what I'm praying for. Please let me meet the man of my life. The only one who deserves my love and who will love me back. Friend Lord, just give me a sign! Please let us have any kind of contact tomorrow! I hope I get to see him! I'll be honest with you, dude. I liked your parents better... before they joined that church group. Seriously? Before my parents joined that group, they wanted to kill each other. Remember that time when my mom threw an iron at my dad? And there was a time my dad pointed a gun at my mom. Remember? Exactly. At least they used to be normal. Now, dude... all they do... is wait for the Rapture. And look at yourself! You're starting to be like them! You look like a missionary who makes Bible deliveries. How do you expect girls to like you? Why don't we get some frappé? -It's too hot today! -All right, let's go! Hey, aren't you coming? No, go ahead. I don't drink coffee, anyway. It might give me anxiety and I might have trouble sleeping. Go ahead, I'll be fine. -Fine. -Okay. Ouch... Dude, she may be eighteen, but she's one of a kind. You're such a pervert. You really want to ruin that girl's life? You're crazy. No, dude, she's from Europe. I was shocked. She seemed to know more than I do. You want me to set you up with her? Let's just go. Hang on, I need to pee. I'll be back, okay? Mocha, vanilla... Hey... Wait... -I thought you didn't want... -He's here! -Who? -The sign! The guy from the train! The sign... -Who? -Where is he? -He might see you. -Where? Don't worry. I got this. What would you do? He's wearing an ID, right? Do you want to know his name? Okay, go. Oh, I'm sorry. Hi. Bye. You see that girl? Trust me, she wants your body. So, did you get his name? What is it? -Talk, or else I'll dump this on you! -Hey! Come on, tell me! Morelos. Comma. Michael. His name is Michael Morelos. -Are you happy now? -Michael Morelos... Elizabeth. You know my name? My thoughts are with you, every second... -every minute, -every minute, -every hour of every day. -every hour of every day. -Betchay. -What's going on with you? You're being possessed again... Michael Morelos. Michael Morelos. Lord, please. One more sign. Just one more sign, please. What is it? You want to meet Morelos, Michael, right? Well, guess what? My God, Estefania! What did you do? I met his cousin at Slumber Bar and we set up a double date with you! -What? -Yes, you're going on a date with him! We're going on a date! That's great... We're going on a date! Hurry up! They're here! -Smile... -I think I'm going to faint. Try doing that and I'm going to leave you. We're sorry, the traffic was terrible. Even parking is a hassle. You know what, it's okay 'cause it's a Friday night. By the way, Betsy, this is Jacob. And this is his cousin... -What's your name again? -Michael. Michael Morelos. I know. Pardon? I said, now I know that you're Mr. Morelos. Morelos, Michael. Yes! Okay. So, what movie are we catching, dudes? Oh, dudes, you know what? You decide. You decide on that. I think I like Haunted Sweethearts. I like Haunted Sweethearts, too. Haunted Sweethearts? Horror movie? Yes! There it is! Hey, tell me, is the girl dead? How would you know if you keep hiding behind your bag? But I don't want to see it. So, is the girl dead? There, she's dead. -There. Look. -No... How did she die? How did she die? Only you Until there's love My heart will yearn Only for you Wow, you sing with so much heart! Of course, that song has a personal meaning to me. You want me to sing more? ‪-You want more? ‪-That's enough, sis. I'm having a migraine and you've sung three songs already. Pass me the mic. Mikey, it's your turn. -No, it's okay. -What? Excuse me. Wait! Where are you going? -Where are you going? -I just need some air. -It won't take long. -Mikey, boy, just one song! -No, thanks. Excuse me. -What's the matter? Yes? Are you okay? Yes. May I sit beside you? Okay. I went out because I was feeling claustrophobic. Actually, Stefi doesn't really sing. It's just that nobody has the guts to tell her about it. Her singing gave me a headache. Me, too! In fact, at her sister's wedding reception, they made a mistake by letting her sing. She sang three songs of Celine Dion... so the reception ended early. And you know what... Sorry... I guess my story makes you sleepy. Not at all. I'm just tired from work. And the train we ride at Magallanes leaves early. Don't you agree? You're aware that we take the same train from Magallanes? Of course. Since when? When we were at the movie house. Really? Let's go. Where? When I was a kid, my dad used to love fishing. But he wasn't any good at it. My mom said we should just buy fish from the market. That way, we get to pick the fish that we want without my dad getting sunburnt! You know, I miss that. Ever since my mom left, we weren't able to go fishing anymore. You know, I don't get tanned whenever I get sunburnt. My skin just turns red like a crab! I would like to hear your stories. What stories? Don't you have a story to tell? I don't. That's impossible! Life is filled with stories! Some of which may be sad, funny, or plain boring. But in life, there's always a story to tell! Well, sometimes, you get to know a person better if you both stay silent. That's deep. You're deep. I like that! Why don't you... Sorry. I would love to hear more. You tell good stories, anyway. What else can I share? Did you know that my brother has had three suicide attempts already? Why? Because his wife left him. She went with another woman. So, this is your place? -You want to come in... -Thank you. Good night. So... What now? I said... What now? Thank you for the evening. Good night, Betsy. Okay. Shall I give you a call? When? When will you call me? What? I mean... I'm currently training at a call center. I might get the job soon and... Betsy. I have your number. ‪-Okay. ‪-All right. Good night. Good night. Oh, wait. Hang on. Just a souvenir. All right. Good night. -Take care. -Okay. Good night. You chickened out again. Why don't you call her? -Don't you think she's pretty? -I do, but... What is it? Come on, dude. I just don't think she's my type. She talks too much and she's not very ladylike. She's just outgoing. Being outgoing is different from being hyperactive. Right? I like a girl who's modest. Reserved. Someone who seems helpless... Mikey? Kat? Dude, I'll just wait for you in the car. How are you? My God, it's so nice to see you again. I'm okay. I'm okay. How about you? I'm good. This is... This is so weird. I know. I thought you were still in the States. I went home with my mom. Since when? I mean... -Why didn't you tell me? -Well, Mikey... Were you able to find that olive oil? Mikey, this is Ralph, my fiancé. Ralph, this is Mikey. A friend of mine from way, way back. Hey, man. Hey. Actually, there's a reason why I'm here. Ralph and I are getting married next month. Oh, is that... Really? Wow... -Congratulations! -Thank you. We'll go ahead, man. We still have something to look at. Yes, I'll go ahead, too. My cousin is waiting for me. Should I call him? Just a friendly call! I'll just check on him. Check on him? Does he have some kind of terminal disease? What if he lost my number? But I thought you gave it to him? What if it got deleted? Betchay, according to Jacob, his cousin is really like that. A bit of a weirdo. Wait a second! Ouch! Can you give us a minute? When did you talk to Jacob? We went out again last night. -Hey, hold it right there! -Ouch! Stop pulling my hair! That seems unfair! Aren't you supposed to set me up with Michael? How come it's you and Jacob who are getting along well? They need this ASAP. Stefi, look! Ouch! Answer it. Hi, there! How are you? Betsy? -Yes? -Okay... You called? I'm sorry... I was calling someone else, but I must have dialed the wrong name. Mike. -So, how are you? -Can you give me Mrs. Cervantes' files? I'm okay. You're in the office? -Thank you. -Yes. You're working? You could say that. Are you busy? Sort of. Okay. Sorry, Betsy, I'll just call you some other time. I have to go. -Sure. -Okay. -Take care. Bye. -Okay, bye. What did he say? He said he's busy... and he'll call me some other time. I hate you, Stefi! -Ouch. -Why didn't you stop me from calling him? Quezon Avenue, please. One moment. -Hurry up, the train is arriving. -Hang on, my wallet is missing. Then step out of the line. But I need to catch that train. Here. No, it's okay. Are you going to buy a ticket or not? Just take it. Thank you, Betsy! I'll pay you back! Excuse... Excuse me. Hey! Chito! Let's grab some lunch! Your treat! Let's go! You can do that later. Miss, where can I find Groundwood International Call Center? Twelfth floor. Betsy! Betsy! Michael! -I'm okay. -Are you all right? -Are you okay? -Sorry... -I just... -What are you doing here? Someone returned my wallet. So, I thought... I will pay you back. -Okay. -Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Betsy, have you eaten already? Not yet. Why? You want to have lunch with me? My treat. Actually, the job at the call center is only temporary. I really want to go abroad. I have a Physical Therapy degree, but I still need to save up. So, I took this job because their starting salary is high. Besides, my parents are against my plans of leaving. My mom would probably kill me if she finds out I want to leave for the States. She doesn't like Americans because she's too patriotic. -How so? -Like I said, it has been six months since we last talked to her. Before she even joined the movement, she was already a veteran activist. She has been tear-gassed, jailed for illegal assembly, hospitalized six times because of riots, and was struck by a police baton! I've never been to the States, but I like it there already. Hang on. I'll show you a photo of my cousin's house in the States. Where is it? It should be... Just a moment... Where is it... -My goodness... -Is this your mom? Yes. Why do you carry all these things with you? For practical reasons, of course. If you have a headache, I have paracetamol, anti-allergy, and antacid. And if you need a pen, take your pick, 24 colors! Thanks for the treat. I hope we can do this again. Sure. Your office is near mine. So, why not? Yes, it's just a short walk from here. You know where my office is? Well, you said it's near, right? Well, thanks again. I have to go back. Bye. Betsy, are you doing something on Saturday night? No. Why do you ask? We're not from the province. All Filipinos... have ancestral roots from the province. So, where's yours? My mom's family is originally from Davao. Is she a Muslim? -No. -Is she pro or anti-abortion? What? What's her take on family planning? Well, my parents are very religious. Opus Dei? No. What's with the outfit? You look like a gay man. -Shut up... -Hey! Where are we going? I've long been wanting to come back here. They serve great food for such a cheap price! But... I can see that you really dressed up for this date. Oh, not really. You're all dolled up. Of course, I want to look good for my date and... I want him to notice me. Well, you've succeeded in your mission. Hey, that's enough. -Why? -You've had a lot already. See? You're tipsy. This is nothing! We're a family of heavy drinkers! And look at yourself! You're the one who's tipsy! You've only had two bottles, but you look flushed already! Wait... -Hold on. -What are you doing? There! Wish! They say that if you catch an eyelash, you can make a wish! Wait... I caught one, too. What was your wish? I would rather not say. Let's drink. Okay. Just go to sleep. You're drunk. I already told you, beer doesn't get me drunk, okay? I'll give you a call. Next time, you don't have to announce it. Just do it, okay? Betsy! Betsy... If you plan on doing something, go ahead and do it. I wouldn't mind. You're unbelievable. Yes, I am one of a kind. Was that okay? That felt like a grandma's kiss. You should probably go inside. Your parents might think we're on to something. Don't worry, I'm sure they've done this back in their day. You should go. You've been saying goodbye, but you're still here! -Bye! -Bye! -Good night. -Good night. Betsy! What... Good night, Betsy. Some scientific studies have proven that the feeling of being in love is only caused by a chemical reaction. Is it really just a chemical reaction? A reaction that makes you feel like every song is written for your love story? Why do people in love seem to be over the moon... and walking on the clouds? Hey. -Hi, Khalil. -What are you doing? Life is so beautiful, isn't it? Are you drunk again? Each day is marked with happy memories. Every moment becomes a chapter of a story filled with love and meaning. In the name of love, why can we suddenly do things we thought we were incapable of doing? Why do we suddenly become patient and brave? Most of all, why does it make us happy? It makes us so happy, am I right? And they started chasing each other with bolos! Can you imagine? My siblings and I were all hiding out of fear. What if you got chased? But, you know... the only thing I prayed for... was for them to break up. Just to end the mess. So, that's why you're so sad. Betsy... what are you talking about? I'm okay. It's all in the past. Stop crying. It doesn't suit you. Michael? Since we're talking about the past, I have a question for you. Have you ever been in a serious relationship? Do you really have to ask that? Of course, I don't want any secrets between us. Don't worry, I won't get mad. Please? The answer is yes. That's enough, okay? What was she like? Beautiful? Kind? What did you like about her? Betsy, you can ask me about anything... ...except that. Fine. What did you like about me? Betsy... Is it because I'm beautiful? I'm kind, sincere, honest, and sensitive, am I not? Why are you laughing at me? Oh, I got it. Is it because you're happy when we're together? Am I right? Tell me! Too much... Too much? You have too much self-confidence! Admit it! You're happy when you're with me! -Right? Come on! -Fine! Yes! I already said yes. We need to reconcile those books before 11 a.m. on Friday. Because... Because the officers of Hermes Trading will be here. To... They expect us to explain the... Whose phone is that? I can't concentrate, it's too distracting! Whose is it? -Michael? -Ma'am? -Turn it off. -Yes, ma'am. -Now! -Yes, ma'am. Sorry. So annoying! ‪-Hello? ‪-Why aren't you replying to my texts? Why can't I reach you? Where have you been? I'm here in the office. As far as I know, there are no dead spots in your office. Keep it down! I turned off my phone during the meeting. I forgot to turn it back on. Michael, follow me. Wait, I have to go. I'll call you later. I'm just busy now. -You're overreacting! -Thank you. He already told you he's at work. What did you expect? Well, what about me? I'm busy too, but I still make time for him! You know, Betchay, a normal person wouldn't send 300 texts a day to someone he's obsessed with! Right! Aside from that, why do you always have to check on him? You're not a doctor and he's not sick! You're starting to annoy him! She's like your girlfriend who's also addicted to texting! True! My goodness! She's too much! I'm not annoying. ‪I'm just being thoughtful, okay? He's the one taking me for granted. -Okay? -Okay... Are you mad at me? You weren't replying to my texts. I've been calling your office phone, but the line is always busy. I've tried calling your cell, but you're rejecting my calls. At least now you know how it feels. My God, Betsy, please be reasonable. Just because I don't pick up your calls or reply to your texts, it doesn't mean I don't want to talk to you. It doesn't mean I don't want to talk to you. We had a deadline, okay? You know what? Never mind. Let's not talk about this. Forget it. Did you come here to argue or to apologize? Okay. I'm sorry. What kind of apology is that? It doesn't sound sincere. What do you want me to do? You want me to get down on my knees? Okay. Here. Betsy, I'm sorry. That's too much... What's wrong with your hand? I'm sorry. Okay. Okay? Okay. Are you sure you're okay? Yes, I'm okay. Okay. -I'll get that. -No, I got it. -Come on. -I'll do it. Suit yourself. ‪Excuse me. How long have you been friends with my son? Just recently. Well, he never mentions anything about you. Come to think of it, Mikey hardly tells us anything. He's always in his room with his computer. By the way, is your family affiliated with a church group? We're not. What do you mean? My family is not really religious. We're more socially conscious than religious. Oh, that's okay. You know, God is always in our hearts and in our spirits. So, even if you rarely go to church, if Jesus is in your heart and your spirit, that should suffice. But I assume you're Catholic, even if you're not active in church? We are. But... But what? We stopped discussing religion at home ever since my mom joined the movement. Movement? As in... the rebel movement? Oh, yes! In fact, my godfather holds one of the top positions in the NPA. And my mom joined them. Your mom joined them? Yes. They went to live in the mountains. You told my mom that your mom's a communist? Yes. You told me to just be myself when I'm talking to them. Are you sure about your decision? It may just be a petty fight. -Stefi is right. -No, we're done. It's the end. You've been in a relationship with Maritess for two years, and you're just ending it like it's nothing? Well, I finally came to my senses. I've had enough. Come on, let me see how this looks. Martin, you've been playing the martyr for so long, but you've realized that just now? But you know what? It actually feels good after having a lovers' quarrel... because you get to be sweet to your partner again. Look at you. Just because you got that accountant under your spell, you think you're a love guru? -Hey, that's harsh. -She's right! But you know, I still argue with Michael for the pettiest reasons. What? Why would you do that? I noticed we become sweeter with each other after we make up. And if we don't fight that much, the relationship gets boring. Wait a second. Between you and Michael, who's the sadist and who's the masochist? Let's just look for another restaurant. We can't find a parking spot. We'll find one. Don't give up so easily! Let's check here. -Look, I think that car is leaving. -Finally. See? I told you so. We wouldn't find this spot if we gave up and left. Can you believe these idiots? -Betsy, don't! -But that's our spot! -Stop it! -They have no right to take it! Betsy, stop! Where are you going? Betsy! Hey, this is our spot. Move it! -Betsy, please calm down. -Let me go! -We were here first! -Enough... -Why don't you fight back? -Betsy... -How dare you! -Betsy... You can't just steal this spot! -What's your problem? -No, we're sorry. You are the problem! You stole our parking space! -Hey, we were here first! -No way! We got here first! -Move your car somewhere else! -But we were here first! Shit! Bro... Maybe we can... Michael! You and Michael are close, aren't you? Why don't you talk to him? But Auntie... I think that girl is a bad influence on him. Auntie, Michael is way past the age of puberty. I'm sure he knows what he's doing. Are you sure? To get beaten up just because of that brat? You know your cousin is a bit naive when it comes to girls. Betsy is not a bad person. Was she the one who punched me? And you know what? What you're doing is the opposite of being a Christian. You're judging a person without knowing her. That's against the Bible! Let's go. God bless you, Auntie. You too, Uncle. Dude, can you tell me what really happened? How did you end up in a fight? I'm not in the mood to tell you. Mikey, dude, I just want to ask... -Are you really serious with that girl? -Of course, I am. Come on! You don't sound so sure! When I first saw this, I told myself, it's about time. About time for what? For you to wear trendy clothes! You look a lot older than your age because of the clothes you wear. Look, it suits you well! It looks good on you! Look! Not your type? You don't like it? -No, it's just that... -But you still don't like it. -Maybe I'll wear it... -Give it back. What's wrong? You don't like it! -I want... -You want to return it! I like it, okay? All I'm asking for is a little appreciation! -He's conservative. -You mean he's not fashionable? Aside from that, he's too stingy! We've only been to one restaurant since we started dating! The one that's cheap but has big servings! The eat-all-you-can style! Okay, so Mr. Intelligent and Elegant... turned out to be outdated and cheap? Now, you're having doubts... because he's not the man of your fantasies? Sis, remember this. They are never the people you think they are. Are you okay? I'm exhausted. I took a lot of calls... and my jaw hurts from speaking with an accent. So, where do you want to go? It's up to you. You wanted to hang out, so you decide. -Let's just watch a movie. -A movie? Why not? There's nothing good to watch. Then let's just go to the mall. Again? Can we go somewhere else? -What do you think? -Let's just eat outside. I'm still full. My officemate brought food for his birthday. I had two plates of spaghetti. So, where should we go? You rejected my suggestions and now you're asking me again? Hang on, why are you mad? I'm not mad. Just tell me where we're going. Nobody said that a relationship between two people... would only be filled with happy days. Because no two people are alike. And because of their differences, their love may begin to bloom... while misunderstandings start to grow. That's how relationships are. Similar, opposites, yet still together. Nobody is perfect. These imperfections give depth to a relationship. But it could also be the reason feelings end. Mike, how was the meeting? You think our boss is in a bad mood? No, she seems to be in a good mood. She even told a lame joke. But we all laughed anyway. She could use some encouragement. Dude, check this out. What's that? -Excuse me, miss. -Yes, ma'am? I'm looking for the Finance department... -Just go straight ahead. -Where? -Okay, miss. Thank you. -Who's that? Her? She's new here. It's her first day in Finance. Her name is Joey. Excuse me. What time is it? Long story. You were supposed to be here by 5:30. It's 7:00. I've been texting and calling, but you never responded. My phone died. I wasn't able to charge it last night. How come? I just forgot. Where's our cab? That's the other reason I'm late. I had a hard time getting a cab, so I just walked. So, how are we going to have dinner? You use your hands to eat, not a cab. You even have the nerve to act smart with me? Excuse me? -Yes? -Are you busy? -Not really. -Well, I have a problem. Should I just call Maintenance? No, I got this. -Are you sure you can open it? -Yes, it's just a bit tight. See? Okay, I got it. Open sesame! -Wow! Thank you. -No problem. Thanks a lot. Here, just call Ben, so he can check on your lock. Okay. I'll go ahead. My goodness! A cockroach! Kill it! Please! Hurry! -Cockroach! -Okay, wait. Hold on. I got it. Hurry up and kill it! Die! It's dead! Look, it's not moving! Yuck! Why did you use my bag to kill it? I thought it's a folder. Sorry. Excuse me. Hey. Here you go. It's all clean. -No trace of cockroach at all. -I see. And it smells good, too. ‪Good as new. Thank you. How kind of you. I didn't know you're sweet. Oh, by the way. Here's your cell phone. You left it at my desk. No worries. And... Thank you, too. You know, I can handle anything except cockroaches and snakes! -Otherwise, I go crazy. -Of course. Thank you. WHERE ARE YOU? I've noticed that he has changed. How so? He keeps to himself most of the time. -And... -Why wouldn't he be? You talk too much! Close your eyes! No, I feel like he doesn't appreciate... Stop it, Betchay. I've heard enough of that. Come with me. It's about time I get frank with you. Hey! Okay, we're best friends, right? Friends, best friends... ‪-More than best friends. ‪-Right? Hey, watch it! Okay, if we're more than best friends, I'm sure I can tell you anything, right? And I'm just telling you this because... I want to be honest with you, and... I just want the best for you and this accountant... What? Come on, the suspense is killing me. Just spill it already! Are you sure you can take it? Okay. Elizabeth. Any guy who receives your countless text messages with quotations from the Bible, every hour of the day... -would definitely go nuts! -What's wrong with that? You really don't know? Betchay, you monitor your boyfriend as if he's an ICU patient in critical condition! That's just wrong! Now, you're wondering why he's always pissed and irritated? You should be thankful he hasn't left you! -My God! -You don't understand. I just want to share my life. -Oh, please! -Ouch! That's what you get... from watching all those romantic movies! Stop sharing your life as if it's some kind of charity! You're so corny! And will you stop acting like a kid? Please! Really, Stefi? -You think so? -Of course! You're his girlfriend, partner, and lover. You're not his... A: Bodyguard B: Nurse... C: Nanny... and most of all... D: His mother! Girl, he already has a mom! And have you ever heard of the words, A: Annoying... B: Sickening... C: Suffocating... That's you! You're not just letters A, B, and C. You're also letter D! -You know what that is? -What? D: All of the above! And Betchay, there's no such thing as a fairy godmother. Keep that in mind. There's no fairy godmother who will grant your wish. That's not how life works! You're a human being who's capable of love. And you have to remember that your boyfriend is only human, too. Okay? You're so unfair, Estefania! Why didn't you tell me that sooner? I thought we're friends. I am your friend! That's why I'm saying this... Ouch! You stepped on my foot! Hey! Where are you going? Get back here! I'm not done with your makeup! Okay, thank you. Excuse me, I'm looking for Michael Morelos. Oh, Michael? He just stepped out about 15 minutes ago. Is that so? Is there someone who knows where he went? Wait. Mr. Perez! Chito! Come here! Yes? You can ask him. They work together in Accounting. Okay. Hi, I'm Betsy. I'm a friend of Michael. I know. I saw your picture on his computer monitor. You're his wallpaper. Hey. She told me he went out. Would you know if he has a business meeting or... Well, he was asking me out for lunch a while ago. He wanted to eat at his favorite Spanish restaurant... but he suddenly disappeared. Where exactly is this restaurant? Are you sure she won't get mad if she finds out we're together? Who are you referring to? I know you have a girlfriend. And who told you that gossip? Michael, you can't hide things like that. Besides, it's okay. It's okay? We're not doing anything wrong, are we? We're just having lunch. Why should she get mad? And besides, you're not yet married. And even if you are, it doesn't mean that you can't be friends with people of the opposite sex. Wow. Why? It just makes sense! I hope, one time... you could talk to her. I mean... So you can tell her what you just told me. Excuse me, sir? Would you like me to place your orders now, sir? By the way, ma'am, would you like me to raise the shades for you? Yes, please. It's not that hot anyway. -Okay. -Thank you. Why? -What are you doing? -Eyelash! They say that if you catch an eyelash, you can make a wish. Then make a wish. So, what did you wish for? You're funny. Hi! Betsy... You're the girl on his computer monitor, right? Hi, I'm Joey. Hi! Michael and I work together and... we were just talking about you. Really? That's right. He told me a lot about you and... So, what were you telling her about me? What did you tell her? What? Tell me! Betsy, wait. Betsy... Betsy! Betsy! -Betsy... -Before you think of anything... I want you to know I didn't follow you at the restaurant. I went to your office because I wanted to talk to you personally. But you weren't there. Why don't you speak up? Nothing. Michael, it can't always be like this. Nothing? It's 11:30 and you went out of your way to get here. I'm sure you have something to tell me. Betsy... I don't want to know who that girl is. Maybe I just want to clarify something. Do you like her? Let me rephrase that. Do you like me? Betsy. I came here because... Maybe... it would be better... if we give... each other some time. Time for what? Time... Time to think? -You understand... -Yes. I completely understand. -Here she comes. -Let's go. -That's the right mindset! -They should do some research first... -Why? -Hey. Dad, I'm going to bed. -Okay. -Good night, Khalil. Good night. Hey! Do you really want to get our friend drunk? Oh, please! She can handle that! She drinks like a sailor! Go, girl, drink some more. Betchay, that's enough. It's your fault. You took it too seriously. What did you expect? You know, boys will always be boys, no matter how decent they may look. Hey! That's enough! You're just making her more depressed. I'm just telling her the truth! Betch, that's enough. -Betch, drink some more. -Betch, that's enough. -No, Betch, drink up. -Betch, that's enough. Leave her be! It was so difficult! Hey, Michael, is my shirt here? Hey, this looks good! It looks new! Let me borrow this. -Let me use it. -Not this shirt! Okay. Never mind, then. It's all yours! So, what really happened? Even Stefi is acting weird! This is between you and your girl. Leave me out of it! It's nothing. Nothing? Betsy is close to having a nervous breakdown! You're stupid! You tried to be sneaky, but you were so careless! You know, dude? Every man should know the art of sneaking around! I'll teach you. -It's nothing like that. -Then what? I don't know. Things happened so fast. I'm not even sure if I really courted her or if it was the other way around. So, who's that girl you got caught with? Are you also courting her? Dude, you have to make up your mind! It's either you're serious or you're just playing around. If you're just playing around, make sure the girl isn't serious. Because if she is serious, it will only end up badly! Get it, dude? You can have it. Hello? Hello, Betchay? Is there a problem? Nothing. Bye. Are you busy? No. -I'm fine. Why? -No, you're not fine. I've noticed for a few days that... something is wrong with you. Is it your girl? Michael, it is not the end of the world. You know, there are... -But... -Enough with the sad stories. I easily get depressed. I feel bad whenever my friends are sad. That's why... I'll try to make you happy. I want to remove the sour look on your face. Why are you doing this? Because I want to. What's wrong with that? Why are you not drinking? I already told you, I don't drink much. But you're okay? Then stop looking at your watch! I feel like I'm dating Cinderella. Oh, my God! It's my friend, Celine! I didn't know she got back from the States. Let's join them! No, thank you... It's too crowded over there. A lot of smokers, too. Michael, we've been sitting here for hours! It can't be just the two of us the whole night. What's wrong with that? Michael, there are other people in this world, you know? Go ahead and join your friends if you like. What about you? I'll stay here. Are you sure? Okay, I'll be there for a while. Bye! -Celine! Hi! -Hey! -Hello! -Hello! -Hi. -How are you? -Hi! -Who's your date? He's just an officemate. These days, it's hard to find a woman who takes relationships seriously. They change partners as if they're just changing clothes. You don't want another drink, sir? I was shocked! You really had to tell that to Mom? Can you imagine if he was wearing a dress? Come on, I just really liked that toy. It's not like... -Go ahead and show it to her! -No way! Dad? Betsy? You're home. Your father reached out to me. He said you needed your mother. I knew this time would come. Forgive me, Betsy. Don't cry. My little girl is all grown up. Beer? I could use one. I noticed. Looks like you had a good night. I'm not even drunk. Is something wrong? Are you and Mommy having problems again? That's part of my daily life. Dad? Have you ever thought of leaving your wife? I've thought about it a number of times. Different reasons. Different scenarios. And? Two things. It's either I'm too proud... or I'm a coward. What do you mean? I'm arrogant in the sense... that your mom picked me over her other suitors, I don't think I can accept that we didn't make it work. On the other hand, I'm a coward because I thought that if we do get separated... and I don't handle it well, I might just realize that I'm better off with her. You're not making sense, Dad. I've been that way for 24 years now! And for 24 years, I've been asking myself why I love your mother so much! To think we're so different from each other. She's controlling, always nagging, and jealous! She gets pissed if you don't pick up her calls. Forget about her birthday, expect a war! Even if she knows you're tired, she still expects you to tell her about your day! Even if it's a lame story, she expects you to listen because if you don't... -She won't stop nagging you! -She will ignore you for a week! After that, she starts sulking. Because... -she thinks she's taken for granted... -Exactly! But if she's not around, you don't seem contented. Like something is missing. -You'll miss the noise. -It's suddenly all quiet! -You're uneasy! -You want to hit somebody! -Because you badly miss her! -So much! Then what's the problem? Do you love her? What if she leaves me just like Katherine did? Is her name Katherine? It's Betsy. Even if her name is Katherine, they're still different. I don't know, Dad. Maybe... I don't want to end up like you and Mommy. Then don't! How can I be sure? You can't be sure. I can't guarantee that you won't get hurt again. I can't guarantee that you won't have problems. But I also can't guarantee that you won't be happy! Because that's how love goes! Not knowing... is the sweetest mystery in loving another person. And how much you can love... is the greatest discovery... you can have of yourself. Is Dad still your ideal man? He still is. You know, the concept of an ideal man has a different meaning when you're young and in love. You may think the person you love is perfect... and you expect him to stay that way. But as you grow older, you'll start to see the real him. That he's not perfect just like you. Just like everybody else. But, Mom? Does that mean... you made a mistake in choosing him? Doesn't it frustrate you? Do you stop caring? You feel hopeless! You get what I mean? Do you stop loving? Of course not. It only means that if you truly love him, you'll learn to accept his imperfections. And he should do the same. And the most important thing... what you both have to accept about each other... is the fact that you're never alike and are continuously changing. It seems difficult. That's because you're in love! Excuse me. Betsy? -Excuse me. -Betsy! Betsy! -Hang on. -You're cutting in line! -I... -Watch it. I just want to tell you something. What? You're annoying. You meddle too much. You talk too much. You're hot-headed. -Sometimes... -He said she meddles too much. you're pissing me off. Betsy! Betsy! Let me through! Betsy! Wait! Betsy! Betsy! -Hey! -Mister! I'm sorry, but I need your motorcycle. I'm so sorry. -I'll pay you later! -Okay, hop on. You may sit here, ma'am. Thank you. Are you okay, ma'am? I hate him. He didn't have the guts to tell me in person. He broke up with me through a letter! "I realized that I don't love you anymore." Don't cry. At least, he told you what he truly feels. He was honest... and he didn't give you false hopes. If that's true, then why can't he say it to my face? That's what hurts me the most. Have you ever been in love? Who knows? This may be a blessing in disguise. Maybe... there's someone who's more deserving to have you. Oh, no! I missed my stop! This letter is too long. I'm sorry, but I really have to go. Good luck with your love life. Good luck with yours, too. Excuse me. Excuse me. Thanks again. Hey! Wait! Your flowers! Thank you! Stop right there! Excuse me. Betsy? Betsy! Betsy! -Stop right there! -Betsy! Let go of me! -Don't jump in there! -Betsy! Hey! -Betsy! Wait! -That's dangerous, sir! I want to tell you something! Get lost! I don't want to hear it! This is important! Please listen to me! Betsy, please! You're stubborn! Meddlesome! Talkative! Hot-headed! -Sometimes, you annoy me! -You really want to get hurt? Hold on, let me finish! This is important! Wait. Please! Get off me! And because that's who you are, I realized something. Betsy, I love you so much! And whatever happens, I don't want you to change! Say something. I'm starting to look like a fool here. What did you say? You heard it already. Don't make me say it again. I love you so much! Betsy! Excuse me. Excuse me. Betsy! I love you so much, Betsy. I really do. And that's what everyone hopes for. To find that person they're destined to be with for the rest of their lives. Who knows? He may be right beside you.
