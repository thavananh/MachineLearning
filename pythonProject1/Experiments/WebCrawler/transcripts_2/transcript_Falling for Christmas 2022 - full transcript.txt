Tell your father you don't want the job. He flew me all the way up here in his private jet for Christmas. I don't want to hurt his feelings. Wow. Good morning, Miss Belmont. I'm Terry Carver from Guest Services. Your father has asked me to work as your personal assistant while you're here. And this is your Glam Squad. Fine. It's just that I don't want to be in the hotel business. Have you tried telling him that? Mm. Daddy wouldn't understand. As far as he's concerned, this is the perfect career for me. I'm just trying to imagine what you'd have to wear. Not a name tag, I hope. - What exactly is the position? - Vice President of Atmosphere. It's not even a real job. I think he just made it up to give me something to do. And, you know, it's hard enough for me as it is. When people look at me, all they see is the spoiled daughter of Beauregard Belmont, the hotel magnate. And I'm not spoiled! Dress or slacks? I don't know. Is that pleather? Vegan leather. Oh, Tad, help me! I need to make my own mark in the world. Okay, okay. How are your socials doing? Not good. I told you my accounts were hacked by that girl, remember? Ugh! Right. Lucky you're dating one of Hype Magazine's top social influencers then. So you remind me every day. After lunch with your father, why don't we hit the slopes and snap a few ussies? Hmm? Post them on Instagram. I thought you wanted to keep our relationship private. Well, maybe it's time we let the world in on it. Talk about boosting your numbers. And it will prove to your father you could have a career as an influencer too. Yeah, I just want people to remember me for more than my last name. You leave it to your Tad. Oh, trending down. Time for a selfie in a limo. See you soon. Okay, I love... Hello? Bad connection? Something like that. Let's go with the Valenyagi. - Good choice. - And a fabulous hat. Mr. Belmont! Hey! Glad I caught you. Hi. Hey. Uh, I'm Jake Russell. I own the... - The North Star Lodge. - Yeah. Yeah, my secretary mentioned you called. - Fifteen times. - Was it that many? So, what's the urgency? I just wanted a minute of your time if I could. Sure. But you're gonna have to beat me to the bottom of the run. - Seriously? - Well, what do you think? Falling behind, boy! Better get moving! Good run. Yeah, I thought I had you there for a minute, but you got me in the end. Let's go. You can talk while we walk. Thanks, Skyler. Wow, this place looks like something out of SpaceX. Well, we try to stay ahead of the curve. In here. Wow. Well, you have an incredible place here, sir. It's, uh, truly a world-class skiing destination. But, you know, not everybody can afford world-class. Studies show that 70% of beginners learn to ski at these smaller resorts. Like yours. Exactly. And then as they become more accomplished and better skiers, then they move up to the mega-resorts, like this one. And you think that I should invest in your lodge in order to make sure that this keeps happening, correct? Uh, more or less, yeah. Oh, Skyler. Cocoa? - Um, sure. - Two please. Of course, Mr. Belmont. But I have the numbers here for a cost-effective upgrade, a high-speed lift, you know, building on a spa with a hot tub, sauna... Mr. Russell, I wish I could help you, but I have my own investors to answer to. - I'm sure you understand. Thank you, dear. - Well... Here you go. On the house. - And anything else he may need today. - Of course. If you'll excuse me, I gotta run. Oh, and, uh, pretty classy out there letting me win. Well done. This is security. Alert the staff. Miss Belmont is on the move. ♪ They can see us comin' From a mile away ♪ ♪ They wanna see us, wanna be us Nah, we don't play ♪ ♪ Yeah, gettin' fancy, edge of your seat ♪ ♪ We got a groove makin' you move Now c'mon get on your feet ♪ ♪ It's like one, two, what's the move? I got two, three... ♪ So, did he bite? - No, he did not go for it. - Ah, bummer. - Well, yeah. It was a long shot anyways. - Sorry, man. - Yeah. See you back at the lodge. - Okay. See you soon. Okay. Well, I'm in the lobby. I don't see you. Well, I'm in the lobby, and let's be honest, I'm pretty hard to miss. Look, I'm by a tapestry that goes really well with my jacket. ♪ Ooh, yeah... ♪ Excuse me. Now I'm in the lounge by the fireplace. - Oh, hey! - Ah! - Oh! - I'm wearing Valenyagi... - Oh, my... - Oh, my God! I am so sorry. I didn't see you there. My Valenyagi! Oh, I'd happily pay for your dry cleaning, or get some club soda... What happened, sweetie? Oh, no! Not the Valenyagi! - Oh! You're making it worse. - Oh! - He ran right into me. - It was an accident! You know, I came around the corner, she was coming around, - and we just, wham, a chocolate thing. - Is everything all right? - I'm a little flustered, but thank you. - Tad! Oh, but this local yokel just body slammed my girlfriend and ruined her haute couture onesie. - Again, I'm so sorry. It was an accident. - Look, mate. Just go, all right? Just go. That way. Yeah. Yeah. Easy with the finger. Would mademoiselle care for the artisanal, house-smoked bacon on her wedge salad? No, thank you. I don't do bacon. Very well. So, Ted, how is this online internet business thing of yours going? It's Tad, Daddy. And it's not a business thing. Tad's an influencer. Millions of people follow him. Basically, you're a salesman. So how long have you two been seeing each other now? Almost a year, Mr. Belmont. I think it's time you call him Beauregard. Right, Daddy? Oh! Okay. Anyway, Beau. You know how it is. One day... there she is. In the coffee shop of life. Sierra is a venti. Trending! Oh! Hi. - Hi, Jake. - Hi, how's it going? Hey, buddy. Oh, come on. - Everything all right? - Hey, Jake. Trying to get this one going, but it's not happening. Okay. Yeah, just leave it in the shed, and I'll get to it later. You got it. Hey! Where you guys going? Dad! The Christmas Wish Tree, remember? Mom took us every year. - That's right. - And now it's Grandma's job. Jake! Why don't you come with us? Well, as fun as that sounds, I have guests that want a sleigh ride, so I'll take a snow check this time. But would you do me a favor? Would you put in a good word with Santa for me? I need all the help I can get. I take it things didn't go well? Belmont was literally the last resort. If the rest of the season's this way, I don't think... We just need a little patience. What we need is a miracle. Haven't you heard, Dad? Christmas is a time for miracles. - Right, Grandma? - That's right. Well, I love your optimism. All right. Yeah. Bring me back something good. Yeah. I'm ready to leave for the airport. Could you have my car brought around? - Yes, Mr. Belmont. - Oh, good. You're still here. - Oh, hi! - I didn't wanna miss you before you left. Well, I'll be back by the weekend. We will get you set up in your new office. I was thinking the one next to mine if that's okay? Oh, Daddy. About the job... Yeah? Well, it's just that... I just don't wanna disappoint you. I don't think you could do that, honey. Oh, I haven't seen this in a while. Your mother gave me that in Gstaad. She said that the little girl reminded her of you. I'm surprised you remember. You were only five when she... I remember her perfume and her laugh. How she used to brush my hair. This hotel reminds me so much of her. I still miss her. Me too. I promised your mother I'd take care of you. You have. I mean, you've given me everything I've ever wanted. Okay. Well, honey, I'll be back by Christmas Eve. Okay. Have a safe flight. And don't worry about me. I'll be in very good hands. I'll be with Tad. Yes, sir! Look out! Coming through! - Hello, move! Move! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Now, I don't want to be disturbed when I'm with Tad. If I need anything, I'll text you. Of course. When would you like dinner sent up to your suite? Terry, I said, "Do not disturb." M'lady, your chariot awaits. I thought we were doing the photo shoot here. Yeah, I've reserved a private gondola. Gondolas are for losers. Hop in. He's colorful. You know, Daddy would have loved if we did the shoot here. Just you wait, angel cakes. Just you wait. Ow! ♪ And a partridge in a pear tree ♪ Oh, I love this song. ♪ What a bright time ♪ ♪ It's the right time ♪ ♪ To rock the night away ♪ ♪ Jingle bell time... ♪ A little pitchy, sweetie. ♪ What a bright time ♪ ♪ It's the right time ♪ Where's your holiday spirit? ♪ Giddy-up jingle horse ♪ ♪ Pick up your feet ♪ ♪ Jingle... ♪ ♪ I'm all out of love ♪ ♪ I'm so lost without you ♪ ♪ I know you were right ♪ ♪ Believing for so long ♪ ♪ I'm all out of love... ♪ ♪ Without you ♪ ♪ I can't be too late to say That I was so wrong ♪ All right, lovebirds. I got hot cocoa and fresh gingerbread cookies. - Are you two ready? - Yeah, let's go! Is this thing safe? My friend, this fine piece of craftsmanship has served the North Star for generations. Where's your sense of adventure? Couldn't be safer. Yo, something just fell off! - Cookie? - Thank you. - It'll be fine. - Have a good ride. Hiya! Where exactly are we going? I follow one of the top off-trail skiers in the country, and he geotagged this secluded spot. It looks amazing. Heavy. Oh! You do know I don't actually ski, don't you? No one needs to know that! It's all smoke and mirrors, baby. Do you know how to unhook the snowmobile, by any chance? Do I look like I know how to unhook a snowmobile? I'll figure it out. Okay, snowmobile, unhook. - What are you doing? - Wait! Tad, it's not voice-activated, for God's sake! Oh! - Oh! - Tad! Tad! Ooh! Tad! I'm getting beaten back here! Ooh! Having fun? So much fun. No signal, okay. Guess we just have to wing it. I think it's... this way. You don't know how to get back to the car, do you? Yes, I do. Hang on. - Tad! - Oh! Look, it's the Wishing Tree! Hot roasted chestnuts, folks, right here. Okay. We're next. And remember, you only get one wish, so make it count. That's good, but could you try to look a little more athletic? But, Tad, I wanna look... I wanna look sporty, but not like I'm sweating. - There's just one thing missing. - What? Well, I can't quite put my finger on it, but maybe you can? Sierra Belmont, the last almost-a-year with you has been truly magical. And I want you to know that whatever the future brings, I want it to bring us together. - Oh! - Sierra Belmont... ...will you marry me? Oh, Tad! Tad, it's too big, sweetie. We could have it resized. Oh. Let's make it official, shall we? Our first social media post as an engaged couple! There. - I wish... - Don't... Don't tell me. You have to keep it a secret, or it won't come true. - You guys have a Merry Christmas. - Thank you. Okay. What was your wish? Um... Uh... I got my wish. When your mommy and daddy had you. Ah! I love you, Grandma. Mm. Okay. Let's put it up in that branch. - Ready? - Yes. - There. - Oh. Very good. - Hm? Oh. - Oh! - Tad? - Looks like the weather's changing. Take me back to the hotel. - Okay. Okay. - Tad. Tad! Whoa! Oh! Hold on, Sierra! I've got you! - I'm slipping! - Hold on! Sierra! No! Oh my... Oh! ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ ♪ In a one-horse open... ♪ Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hang tight, guys. What is it? - Oh, it better not be a dead body. - Stop it. You're freaking me out. Oh my God. Is it a dead body? Hey, miss, can you hear me? Hey, base camp, this is Jake. I'm on the far side of Hoosier. We have a Code 3. Repeat, Code 3. I need Ski Patrol immediately. You got it, Jake. Oh! Uh... How is she? Physically, she's all right. Minor concussion. But that's not the real problem. She says she doesn't remember anything prior to the accident. Amnesia? Or something like it. Well, at least she's awake. That's a good thing, right? Well, that depends upon your point of view. - Ma'am, hold still. - Stop! No, don't touch me! Would you get your hands off of me? Look, I told you I'm perfectly fine, okay? Okay, all right. It's okay. We'll try later. Thank you, Gene. We'll take it from here. Finally, at last, someone with authority. Sheriff, could you please tell her to let me out of here? Well, miss, we'd love to be able to do that, but first we need to figure out who you are. What do you mean who I am? I know who I am. My name is... My name is... My name is... Well, we checked your clothing for any identification, but there was nothing. Oh! I mean, I did find this. Makeup. Where are my clothes? I'm afraid the ER team had to cut you out of those. Hey, uh, what about fingerprints? We took those when we brought her in. They're not registered in our database, which means she's never been arrested or possibly never even employed. So what are we supposed to do with her? Well, I could put her picture up on our missing person website. But it is the holidays, you know. Until someone comes looking for her or until she remembers something, there's not much I can do. Excuse me, she is right here in the room, and she is tired of being treated like a prisoner just because you all can't do your job, so... - Ow! - Oh! - Oh, my head. - Okay. Ow! Take it easy. Take it easy. Look, miss. I wish there was more that I could do, but we have procedures to follow when we're dealing with a Jane Doe. A Jane Doe? I am not a Jane Doe! Well, I don't know what else to call you. You've got no identity, no money, and no place to go. I have a place. I mean, the lodge. I mean, we have some cancellations. She could stay with us. And you are? This is Jake Russell. He's the one who found you. Does he look familiar to you at all? No, he is definitely a stranger. And I'm not about to follow him to some murder cabin in the woods. Jake owns the North Star Lodge. Oh, the North Star Lodge? Okay. Does it have room service? You know, it's actually more of, like, a bed-and-breakfast type place. What kind of breakfast? On second thought, I think she's probably better off here. No. Well... Actually, you know, reestablishing a normal routine of activities might help jog your memory. It's up to you. Now, you can stay here, or you can take old Jake up on his offer. Brilliant! Just absolutely bloody brilliant! What kind of crap forest doesn't have a cell tower? Hello, this is Tad Fairchild. I've just survived a death-defying fall, and I'm currently stranded in a remote glacial forest. This recording will be a testament to my brave fight for life against all odds. Hm. But should anyone find my body... ...please upload this vid... Where am I? All righty. Went through the lost and found. Not sure if these will fit, but they're better than scrubs. Guess they'll have to do for now. Ew. Are these used? Uh... Probably. But, you know, sometimes guests leave things here by accident, so... Not sure this was left here by accident. Okey-dokey, your room is ready. Here are some fresh towels, and there are clean sheets on the bed. Look, I appreciate everything you guys are doing, but I'm not gonna be here for that long. This is just temporary. Well, until then, you're stuck with us. - I'll show you the way. - Okay. Oh. Ooh! What happened? Hi. Uh... There was a wild, hairy beast out there! Okay, I'll check it out. I think you're okay. They're gone. You know, we are out in the wilderness, so you're bound to have a few visitors from time to time. Right. Well, they can stay out there. Yeah, I'll let them know. - What? - Uh, nothing. Nice granny gown. Well, if that's a compliment... I'll take it. Good night. ♪ Hanging my fishing hooks ♪ ♪ Hoping for a fish... ♪ Sanctuary! I thought I'd never see another human being again. Look at you. You're beautiful. What's your name, savior? Ralph. Ralph? My phone battery's dead. I don't suppose you have a charger here for the model 15, do you? Uh, no. Don't like cell phones. - Hm. - Don't trust them. Want some coffee? Yes, please, Ralph. Huh! After my nightmarish ordeal, that would be the nectar of the gods. Mm. Can I help get that lure out your face? What lure? The one stuck in your face. Oh, I see it. Uh-huh. It was just a dream. What's wrong with this thing? - Hi! - Hello! Good morning! Good morning! It's not a dream. Who are you? Hello. Your room is a mess. Yeah, nobody's come to clean it yet. I'm Avy. You're the lady who doesn't know who she is, right? I guess that's me. My dad told me. Do you have anything I could dry my hair with? - Of course. In my room. - Thank you. So, what are we supposed to call you? Good question. I don't know. Do you have any names you like? Well, You can have one of theirs. Oh. Come meet them. That's Frankie, that's Wallace, that's Potter, and that's Sarah. Hmm. Sarah. I like that one. Okay. Sarah it is. Oh. Is this your mom? Yeah. She died almost two years ago. I'm so sorry. I miss her a lot. Sometimes... Hmm? Nothing. You'll think it's weird. Well, I don't even know who I am. Nothing's weirder than that. Well... Sometimes I talk to her picture. I don't think that's weird at all. I think that's beautiful. Hey, how are you feeling? Do you know me? - We met on the sleigh ride. - You were unconscious the whole time. Oh. - Enjoy breakfast. - Thank you. I was unconscious. Hey, everybody! This is Sarah! Oh, Sarah. We're trying it out. You've already met my dad. This is my grandma. Yes. Alejandra. That's right. Well, Sarah, we just ran out of pumpkin pancakes, but if you'd like, I can make you some eggs. Oh, please, I'm perfectly capable of making my own breakfast. It's broken. Yeah. No, you just gotta... You gotta push it in and then twist it. Thank you. Oh, this comes out fast. Egg? Thank you. Oh! Well, you showed that egg who's boss. A little messy. You know what? Um... Why don't you sit over there, and I will take care of all of this. Okay, good idea. - Hm. Bacon? - I don't do bacon. But bacon is delicious. Have you ever tried it? I don't remember. Then how do you know you don't do it? Huh. I like bacon. Mm. What are these muffins? I don't think she's from around here, dear. - What's your favorite one? - Something about her... Mm. I know... I feel like I've met her before. Really? Well, she said she didn't want to be disturbed. But that was almost 24 hours ago. Miss Belmont? This is hotel security. May I come in? Hello? Miss Belmont? It's me, Terry. But she didn't sleep here last night. Are you sure? Maybe she made the bed? Miss Belmont make the bed? Not in this lifetime. "Sierra, can't wait to take you away." "Love, Tad." Sounds like they planned to go off someplace together. - But where? - Don't touch me. Got it. Where am I? Huh? Ralph? No way. Ralph! Ralph! Morning! Thought I'd let you sleep in. You looked all cozy. Is that your truck? Yeah. What's going on with it? Dead as last night's roadkill. Horrible visual. We'll leave a note, head out on foot. It's just a couple days' hike through the pass to get to the road. - Days? - Depending on the weather. Hey, how about I whip us up some fried fish for breakfast? Sound good? Oh, I don't eat fish. They are exotic pets in my saltwater aquarium at my condo in Manhattan. Well, fine by me. Get your own breakfast. - What am I supposed to do with this? - Hurl it at a squirrel? No, it's all right. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Another cancellation. - You're kidding? - They're going to an Airbnb instead. - Well, how do we compete with that? - It's all going to work out. Well, I don't know how. Look at this. We can't even afford a housekeeper. - I know. - Hey. I was just wondering, any calls regarding me? Afraid not. I just don't understand. I mean, surely someone is out there looking for me. You haven't been able to remember anything? No, but the doctor did say that if I did normal things, my memory might come back.

Nice to meet you. I'd introduce myself, but I have no idea who I am. I can tell you I'm pretty much a useless human. I can't do anything right. You'd think I'd have some sort of skill, wouldn't you? Thanks for your support. Now, let's see if I can manage to fetch some wood. See you later. Oh. Whoa! Oh! Oh. Gosh. Are you hurt? No. I... I'll get it. Uh... You all right? Yeah. Look, I'm... I didn't mean what I said earlier. It was... It's not just that. It's been almost two days, and what? No one's found me yet? I'm like unclaimed luggage. Hey, come on. Don't say that. I... I bet you got family and friends who are worried sick about you. I mean, they're probably out there looking for you right now. You think? Of course. You know what? Why don't we go to the Christmas Market downtown? Okay, it's a big street fair, a lot of people there. You know, maybe somebody will recognize you. I don't wanna be any more trouble. No, it's... it's really no trouble. Besides, Avy would love it. All right. Nah, that's... You can keep it. - Right. - Yeah. Thanks. Wow, this is really pretty. Any of this ring a bell? No, nothing. I don't think I've ever been here in my life. Come on! You guys are too slow! Avy gets pretty excited about Christmas. Wow, what a pretty sleigh. She takes after Carla. She was my wife. Yeah, Avy told me about her. I'm sorry. Thank you. It's been a rough couple of years. I mean, I didn't even think we were gonna stay here after. But where would you go? I don't know, like, maybe back to the city? I used to have a, uh... ski travel business. But the North Star's been in Carla's family for three generations. Her father gave it to us as a wedding gift, and I kind of just... fell in love with the place. - I don't want to have to sell it, but... - But? You know, people, they... they like the new resorts, the flashy stuff, all the bells and whistles. But I still think there's something really special about the simple things. You know, like home-style meals, hot chocolate by the fireplace, a home away from home. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. Dad, Sarah. Look at this. Isn't it beautiful? You have very good taste in sleighs, young lady. This one's a beauty, all handmade. Rides like the wind. Well, that's a fantastic-looking sleigh. Um... But I am afraid it is out of our league. Well, I'm here watching this stall for a friend. So, if you see anything else that you'd like, well... Oh! Look at this. Oh, it's beautiful. You okay? Yeah. Uh... You know what? We'll take it. How wonderful. - For you. - No, Jake, I couldn't. Oh, come on. It's an early Christmas gift. Thank you. There you go. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Come on. We don't wanna miss the tree-lighting. Let's go! Merry Christmas, everyone. Please welcome the mayor of Summit Springs. Welcome, everyone, to our annual Christmas tree-lighting ceremony. You know, this is such a special event, and just between you and me, I think it's my favorite reason to be mayor of Summit Springs. Ah! But you didn't come here to listen to me yakking, right? You came in to see some lights. So, hey, without further ado... Why don't you come on up here, sweetie, and help me pull this switch? Me? When we count down, I want you to push that little candy cane, okay? Summit Springs, are you ready? Yeah! All right! Count with me. Five, four, three, two, one!

You know, um, when you first saw that snow globe, you had this look in your eyes like you had seen it before. Yeah, I suddenly had this memory of being a little girl, and this beautiful woman gave me something like that. And I think it might have been my mother. But then, it was gone. Well, I mean, at least you remembered something. That's a start. Yeah. Well, it's been a long night. Yeah. Yeah. Uh... Yeah, I'm pretty beat too, so... Um... Good night. Good night. - Jake? - Uh-huh? I just wanted to tell you I don't think I've ever met anyone like you before because if I had, I would definitely remember it. Good night. - Good morning. - Good morning! It's just me, dear. I come to make the... The trick is, it's all in the wrists. Okay. Okay, that's okay. One more. Do it again. Again. - Okay. You know, just use both hands. - Okay. One, two, three! Hey!

Now, let's see what you got. Let's go! Whoo! Not bad. Woo-hoo! Oh no. Hang on! Ooh! I got you! Sorry, I didn't mean to. It's okay. Thank you for saving me. Any time. Uh... All right, nice. Here you go. That's the bill. You all be safe. - Thanks again. - Thank you. Thanks for staying at the North Star. And Merry Christmas. - You too. - Bye, Sarah. Bye. Alejandra? Oh, I'm sorry, dear. I didn't see you there. Are you okay? I'm fine. Just a little blue, I guess. Probably shouldn't have started looking through this in the first place. What is it? I call it our memory book. Christmas cards, wedding programs, notes from guests. Oh, your daughter. She's really beautiful. Thank you. You are beautiful too. I like to remind myself every now and then how our little family lodge has touched other people's lives. Especially... ...since we might not be here much longer. I thought Jake didn't want to sell. He might not have a choice. The way things are going, this might be our last Christmas at North Star Lodge. Anyway, that's nothing for you to worry about. I've got to pick up, Avy. Ah... Can you put that back in Jake's desk when you're done? - Sure. - Thank you. - Hey, what's going on? - Oh, hi. The drawer was stuck. Yeah, I've been meaning to fix that. This is really beautiful. - Why don't you put it on the tree? - Um... Because it... I'm not ready to put it up. Oh, I'm sorry. It's really none of my business. No, I'm... I'm sorry. I just... It's... We... We... Um, Carla and I bought it together, and... And then she got sick. And... I don't... I don't wanna get rid of it, but I can't bring myself to put it on the tree. So, I... You know what? I gotta go 'cause I'm gonna be late for the toy drive. Uh, toy drive? Yeah. You know, Summit Springs has one every year for families who are having a rough go of it, so... That's really sweet. Yeah, well, you know, every kid deserves something for Christmas. Do you need any help? Yes, that would be nice. ♪ Up on the housetop, reindeer pause ♪ ♪ Out jumps good old Santa Claus ♪ ♪ Down through the chimney With lots of toys ♪ ♪ All for the little ones Christmas joys ♪ - How's it going? - I just finished my first one. Wow! Okay. Um, pretty good. I'll show you a trick. You gotta use as little paper as possible. Wrapping technique shouldn't require more than three pieces of tape. So you do it like this, and then like that. And like this. Very good. Told you. - Jacob! I'm so happy you're here. - Oh! Louise, you know I would never forget my Christmas girlfriend. - It looks like you already have. - This is Sarah. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Jake! We need help sorting things out! All right. Um, I'll be right back. You two... don't talk about me while I'm gone. Hi. Can we drop our toys here? Hi, thank you. - Merry Christmas. Thank you so much. - There you go. I don't know what we'd do without Jake Russell. He volunteers. He donates money. I can't even count how many charities he's helped out in town. I just wish that there was some way that Summit Springs could show him how much he means to us. - Great job on this wrapping. - I don't know if I did wrap... Again, thank you so much for helping out tonight. Oh, thank you for inviting me. Everyone was so nice. So... think you're going to remember any of this when you get your memory back? I'll never forget it. We are standing under the mistletoe. Yes, we are. You know, maybe we shouldn't do this. I mean, what if you're with somebody. That would be unfortunate. For both of us. Yeah. Well... - I'm almost done. - Yes. Morning! - Morning! - Good morning. I have an idea on how we can help the North Star. I've got the contacts for almost every guest we've had over the past three decades. - This is perfect. - Mm-hmm. What's it for? A North Star fundraiser. Cool. Have you talked to dad about it? No, absolutely not. - What? - You heard me. There's no way I'm having a fundraiser to save the lodge. No. It won't be a fundraiser. It'll be like a Christmas flashback party. And we'll invite all the guests you've had over the years to celebrate their favorite North Star memories. And, okay, yes, we'll ask for a donation, but what's the big deal? The big deal is I live in Summit Springs, okay? I don't want people looking at me differently. I don't want them thinking I need a handout. But you don't want to lose the North Star either, do you? Maybe I do. You don't mean that. Look, I'm tired of struggling with this place. I'm tired of everything always breaking down. I'm tired of wondering how we'll make it to the end of the month. Jake, you can't turn your back on this lodge. - Think about all the memories you've made. - I do. I do. All the time. And to be honest, you know, I'd be happy to let some of them go. And what do you know about memories? You can't even remember your name. Sarah, wait. Okay, look, I... It's not you. Okay, actually, it is you. Look, ever since you got here, you... Well, you've made me feel things... Things that I didn't ever think I was ever going to feel again. And, yes, you're right. This place does have a lot of memories for me. I guess I'm just, you know, afraid of making new ones, even with somebody like you. Come in. Everything all right? Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing, just... Is it Sarah? I know it's hard, especially this time of year. I don't know. I just... I don't really know what I'm doing anymore. You've been doing everything you can to hold this family together. But we are all right now. Jake. It's okay to let go. Sarah. We're making snowflakes. Want to come help me? I'm sorry, I can't right now, Avy, but maybe later. Alejandra, can I talk to you for a second? Of course. I think it's time for me to leave. Oh. Don't say that. You know you're welcome to stay as long as it takes. Yes, thank you, but I think it's just best for everyone I just go. Wait. What? Sarah, are you leaving? You can't be. I'm afraid so. But I thought you were gonna stay with us for Christmas. And I would love that, but there's just been a change of plans. Yes, they have changed. Dad. What is that? Something I've been saving for the right moment. But we need Sarah to help us put it up. Please. But you said... I know, but I don't wanna do this without you. A little to the left. - How about that? - And... perfect. It's beautiful, Jake. You know what this place needs right now? A Christmas party? All right, let's do it! Let's go! All right, a little bit closer together. On the count of three, "Merry Christmas." One, two, three. Merry Christmas! All right, you guys enjoy the slopes. All right. Printing. ♪ It's a beautiful sight When the season... ♪ Christmas Eve, come to North Star. There's a Christmas Eve party. Here you go.

Big kick! Not very sneaky. He's walking in now. Hi! I just got to the hotel. So, give me a call when you get this. Thank you, Morgan. Terry? Mr. Belmont. Hello, you're back. Hi. I need to talk to Sierra, but she's not answering her phone. - Have her meet me in my office. - I'm sorry, Mr. Belmont. I don't know where she is. What? I asked you to take care of her while she was here. Well, yes, but she and Mr. Fairchild went skiing the other day, and that's the last time that I saw her. So... "The other day"? Are you telling me you haven't seen my daughter in four days? Well, no, but I just thought she and Mr. Fairchild wanted a little private time together. And she told me not to bother her. Then... Well, I... - We. - We found this note. My daughter never goes anywhere without her luggage. You, have the security team check the grounds. Search every inch of the resort. - I'm on it. - And you, call the Sheriff's Office. Okay. What do I say? You tell them that I want them to find my daughter. Right. We're gonna need a search party. Got some knuckleheads lost in the pass. Copy that. Do we have any idea who it is? Yeah, it's Ralph. Poaching again. Yeah? Are you almost ready, dear? I'm just trying to find something to wear. Well, actually, that's why I'm here. I took the liberty of picking up a little something for you to wear tonight. I hope it fits. Oh my gosh. Thank you so much. You didn't have to. I wanted to. You make Jake smile. He hasn't done that in a long time. Oh! I brought you a pair of shoes too. Thank you. Hmm. - See you downstairs? - Okay. Ralph, I'm afraid we're gonna have to book you this time. What? This is an outrage! That man is a hero. - He was poaching on government land. - He saved my life. You'll have to arrest me too. Ted? Beau! What are you doing here? - Oh, it's a long and terrifying tale. - Where's my daughter? I don't know. I expect at the hotel? No, she's not at the hotel. And I was told she's supposed to be with you. Well, she was, but then we got separated when we were up on the mountain. - I had just proposed to her. - Proposed? - Uh-huh. - "Marriage" proposed? Yeah. - Looks like I'll be calling you "Dad." - Hey, congratulations. - Thank you, friend. - I know where she is. Come on. W-W-W-Wait. What about Ralph? Jasper, let him go. It's Christmas. Well, hey, thank you, Tad. Let's keep in touch, buddy. Your bracelets. Hey, what are you doing? Just checking. You know that that says, "Do not open until Christmas." I'm watching you. Jake, do you think we have enough food? I don't want to run out. I don't think it's gonna be a problem. It's Christmas Eve. People got things to do. It's a very last-minute party, so... It's late, and no one's here yet. Don't give up, Jake. You just need a little bit of faith. Wow! Sarah. I love your dress. You look... Beautiful. Thank you. Alejandra bought it for me. It's lovely on you. Avy, sweetheart, why don't you come help me make some more appetizers. - But Dad said we don't need any more. - Avy. So... So, everything's ready for tonight? Yeah, I think so. Um... You wanna do a final inspection? Sure. Oh, the place looks great. Yeah. Moved out a bunch of the tables, put in a little dance floor, just in case. Maybe we should test it out?

Well, the thing is, the North Star, uh... Well, there is this situation, and, uh... I... I can't do this. You know, I remember the first time our family came to the North Star Lodge. You took my son under your wing and taught him to ski. And I will admit, he wasn't a quick study. No. He was... He was not. He's a Ski Patrol now. Anyway, I, uh, figured I owe you this much for ski lessons. Sorry it's late. Howard, I... I can't. That's... Wow, I... When we got married, we could not afford a honeymoon. Jake, you gave us the biggest suite in the place for the weekend, champagne and everything, and you wouldn't take a dime for it, so... We want to give you... this. Thank you for this. Thank you so much. Thank you, guys. Thank you. I think this is good a time as any to make a little announcement of my own. Summit Springs town council has put forth a proposal to have the North Star Lodge declared a historic site. Oh, wow. Now that should help a bit with funds and grants for renovations and so forth. Now, on a personal note... Well, here's for that time you towed my car out of that snowbank. Oh my gosh. I can't believe you remembered that. You're a good man, Jake. Thank you so much, wow. We love you, Jake. Thank you so much. - Thank you, guys. - Happy holidays. - Gosh. - Merry Christmas. Guys, thank you so much. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Jake. - Thank you. Thank you, everyone. - You deserve it. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you. - We love the North Star. We're happy to do something for you for a change. I really... I really don't know what to say. Gosh. It's all, uh... It's all a little overwhelming for me right now. Um... I would like to say one thing, though. Um... None of this here tonight would be possible if it weren't for a very special guest that we have staying here at the lodge. She's changed the way I see, uh... a lot of things, um, not the least of which is myself. So, can we just, uh... Can we get her up here? Uh... Will you come up here for a second? Everybody, would you please give a big thank you to... Sierra! I found you at last! Darling! Look at you. I've searched, and I've searched. There you go. Reunited for Christmas. So your name is Sierra. Yes. My daughter. - What did he say? - His daughter? Sierra. I remember that name. That's my name. Well, of course it's your name. Who are you? Hello? It's me Tad Fairchild, your fiancé. - I'm engaged? - Yeah. You're... Mr. Belmont's daughter? Dad. Yes. Yes, honey. And I've met you before. Last week. - Um... Mr. Russell? - Yeah, Jake. And I-I... I... Sorry, I... I didn't know who you were. I didn't remember. I bet you'll remember this. It's too big. - I think I told you that, right? - Mm-hmm. Tad. I was skiing, and I... and I fell, and I hit a tree. And then I ended up here, with you. Jake. With you. I have no idea what's transpired here, but clearly, you've taken very good care of my daughter. And I appreciate that a great deal. Let's get you back to the hotel, okay, sweetie? Nice, hot bath, maybe some champagne to help clear your head. Yeah, the hotel. I should get back... That's right. Sarah, wait! I don't want you to go. I'm so sorry, sweetie. But I have to go home.

Are you feeling all right? Yeah. I found this gorgeous piece, just flown in from Milan. I think I'm gonna go simple today. Oh, okay. Thank you. Caviar? Actually, I'm in the mood for something different this morning. She's not acting like herself. - I thought you should know. - That's odd.

Thank you so much for my awesome helmet! All right. I'm just gonna clean up a little bit. Me too. People were very generous last night. Yeah, they were. I don't think it's gonna make a difference if we don't get any reservations. Yeah, you're right. And we're gonna need a Christmas miracle. - This breaking news is just in. - Dad! Missing heiress Sierra Belmont, daughter of hotel magnate Beauregard Belmont... Come here. ...has been found. Let's go live now to the press conference. Miss Belmont. Would you tell us in your own words what happened? Before I answer any questions, I would like to thank Jake Russell and his family at the North Star Lodge. They took very good care of me at their charming ski resort. And I highly recommend it. That's the North Star Lodge. Ms. Belmont, what are your plans for the future? Let me answer that by showing you... this. - Tell us about the proposal. - Mr. Fairchild? - Just one more question. - Does this mean you're eloping? Isn't it beautiful? Who designed the ring? It's by Jefferson Diamonds. #JeffersonJewelryForYou. So, you're engaged. Mr. Fairchild has asked me to marry him. - But I... - You must be excited, Mr. Belmont. Oh, um... Excited doesn't come close to describing how I feel. And when's the big day? That's still in discussion. We're keeping that secret. Actually, we're catching a plane in a couple of hours to an undisclosed destination. So, don't know if... I think we've seen enough. I'll get that. Guess my Christmas wish didn't come true after all. What do you mean, sweetie? When Grandma and I were at The Wishing Tree, I didn't make a wish for myself. I made it for you, Dad. You gave your wish up for me? I wished for you to find someone to love. You take such good care of all of us. I just wanted you to have someone take care of you too. Someone like Sarah. Avy, honey, um... I just... It's just not that easy. Sure, it is. You like her, don't you? - Well, yeah, but it's not... - Did you ever tell her? Not in so many words, no. There's still time, Dad. I think you should tell her. - Go get dressed. Go tell her. Let's go! - Okay, all right. The roads are closed at this end of the valley. I'll take the snowmobile! Maybe not. Dad? What is that? What is that? Whoa! What is this doing here? - Did you and Grandma do this? - No. Where did it come from? I don't know. I'll go get Balthazar. You coming? - You bet! - All right. My Christmas wish. It is coming true. A couple of hours from now, we'll be taking selfies on a beautiful beach. You know what? You go on ahead. - Um, I'll meet you at the car. - Don't be too long. - I won't. - Don't want to miss the flight. Daddy? I'm really sorry I didn't get a chance to tell you about me and Tad, the engagement. Oh, it's okay, honey. You know, the most important thing to me is that you're happy. You are happy, aren't you? Yeah. About the job. Don't worry about the job. It'll be here when you get back. That's the thing. I don't want it to be. I don't understand. Vice President of Atmosphere? You just did that to take care of me. Well, maybe a little, but I... And I love you for it, and I'll always be your daughter. I just... I need to find my own way. I hope you're not angry. Angry? No. I don't think I've ever been more proud of you. Really? I told you I promised your mother that I'd take care of you. Well... Looks like you're starting to take care of yourself. I love you, Dad. I love you too. Your mother would be so proud of you. Thanks, Daddy. Okay. All right. Merry Christmas, North Star Lodge. - ...place on the news? - Yes, this is the place. - I need a reservation. - For how many? When? Oh, may I place you on hold for a moment? Thank you. Merry Christmas, North Star Lodge. Is this the place where Sierra Belmont was? Yes, this is the place where Sierra Belmont stayed. Oh, yes. For how many? Oh! Uh... North Star Lodge? Oh my goodness. Can you hold, please? Let's go, Balthazar! Good boy! Alejandra, hey! - The phone is lighting up like Christmas. - You're kidding. Jake... we're sold out! Oh. Can I get you anything? My jacket, maybe? - Yeah, 'cause winter is like... - Yeah. Okay. Sierra! Ready to go, darling? What are you doing? I'm sorry, Tad. You're a great guy, but I'm just not ready for this yet. I thought I was, but I'm not. Are you breaking up with me? On Christmas Day? I know you, Tad. You'll be okay by New Year's. Huh. Do you mind if I post about this on my page? My followers will love it. Nothing like a breakup to really add to your numbers. Merry Christmas, Tad. Good luck to you. I am so sorry, Mr. Fairchild. Oh! And at the holidays too. Oh. You. Terry. Yep. What are you doing for New Year's? Whoa! All right. Are you okay to watch Balthazar? - Of course. Go find Sarah. - All right. Wait! Much better. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop the car. Don't move. Hold on! Look, can you just give me... give me one second. Look, okay, I... I know we barely know each other, and you'll probably gonna think I'm crazy for saying this. But I... I can't let you leave without telling you I'm falling in love with you. Well, that's very flattering, but I have other plans. Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas. Uh, excuse me, son. I believe what you're looking for is in the back courtyard. - Sierra! - Jake? I thought you were leaving. Uh, no, change of plans. I'm staying here without Tad. You are? Uh-huh. So, what are you doing here? Uh... I... I just wanted to say thank you. I just found out the North Star is sold out for the rest of the season. Really? Hm. Sold out, huh? Sounds like you might need some help running the place. That would be amazing. Well, my dad did also mention investing in the North Star, but I didn't think you'd be interested. Right. I did say I would try to convince you over the holidays. That is, if you wouldn't mind spending them with me. Well, you know what? Um... There is this holiday tradition. But I bumped my head on the way over here, and for the life of me, I can't remember what it is. It's, uh... Yeah, I think I can help you out with that. Oh. There they are. Sierra! - You didn't leave after all. - Hey! Hey. What, um... What happened to Ted? Oh, it's Tad, Daddy. And, uh... It wasn't meant to be. - Happy you're here, Jake. - It's good to see you, Mr. Belmont. - What a Christmas, guys. - Yeah, it's one I'll never forget. And I see you've met my daughter, Avy... Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Tad, I told you a place in the lobby. Where are you? Oh my gosh. Shoot. Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there. It's chaos. Nothing. We're rolling. Mm. Let's go! Come on! Moving skis. Okay, let's do it. - We're not gonna act. - Yeah, yeah. You've made a Christmas wish without me? This is so beautiful. Why don't you put it on the tree? On Dasher! On Dancer! - So? - Hey! Giddy-up! Tad, it's not voice-activated! Get me off of this thing! You're ridiculous! Un, deux, trois! Oh! Oh, my hands! - What's your name, savior? - Ralph. What? Sorry. - I'm sorry, smiling. - I'm sorry. Blinking the whole time? I'm not used to seeing women here at the lodge. Reindeer! We landed on the Moon! ♪ Oh, what fun... ♪ You're off-key. You're off-key, okay? Action! I think you just need to be more polite, darling. - Be polite. - God! Whoo! Give me one more because I can't stop... I can't stop laughing right now. Oh! Not funny. We're gonna get so many partiers. New Year's Eve... Christmas Eve. - Do I have anything on my nose? - Yeah. Nothing's gonna get killed. I don't know how that happened.
