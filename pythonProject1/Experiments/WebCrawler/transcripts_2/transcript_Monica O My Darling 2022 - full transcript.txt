foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Heartiest greetings on Diwali. It was good, Shalu, very good. It was superb. Come on, Gaurya, stop lying. Should I say it again? I'm telling you, it was fine. Why would I lie to you? Happy Diwali. This is amazing. Gaurya! Are you watching porn? What are you doing here? Faridi sir asked me to fetch a file for him. Hey, listen. I have to tell you something. What? - I have something to tell you! - What? We had gone to Pataleshwar Temple. I don't know what came over me. I went down on one knee and proposed. - What did you do? - I proposed to her. - To whom? - Shalu, who else? Man, she started crying. She cried? No... So, she said no? Come on! She said yes! Hey, it calls for a big party! It's her call. Yes, Mrs. Dev Prakash. I love you. I love you, love you, love you... I'm just coming. Don't get angry, my love. Listen, I have talked to Mom and Dad. They have fixed a date next month. So be ready. Yes, Shalu! Shalu, can I call you in a bit? I love you. Okay, bye. Gaurya, is there an issue with the machine? Ladies and gentlemen! Please welcome Mr. Satyanarayan Adhikari! Ladies and gentlemen! In the last few years, our robotics division has done remarkable work. They have surpassed all the records. - And that too, while keeping in mind... - Hey, look back. ...all the Kyoto-900 security measures. One, minute, sir! Sir, one minute. Here. Sir! So you accept that the machinery of your factory is 100% safe. Right, sir? Yes, I do. It means that the death of Supervisor Dev Prakash was not caused by some machine, right, sir? - Sir, one minute. I'll handle it. - Isn't that right, sir? Listen to me, Faridi. Dev Prakash's death was an unfortunate accident. It had nothing to do with our robotic machinery. Sir, then tell me one thing, then why was the security officer, Faridi Baig, I mean me, - fired from the job? - Security! - Sir, I want an answer. Now! - Catch him. Catch him! - Throw him out. Out! - Sir, I want an answer right now! - I want an answer right now! - What a frustrated man he is! Toss him out right now! Dev Prakash's family was fairly compensated. - I want justice! - Unicorn pulled out all the stops. - I want justice! - Such a frustrated man. - I want justice! - Dev will always be in my prayers. - Shalu, are you all right? - But we have to overcome the despair. On the occasion of Unicorn's 50th anniversary, I would like to announce a bonus for all our employees. And now... For the seat on the board of directors, as promised, he will not only be entitled to voting rights, apart from that, he will also receive 4% shares, which has not been granted to any board member till date. This is the maximum. Ladies and gentlemen, let me announce the future of Unicorn Group, Mr. Jayant Arkhedkar. Thank you. - I met him at a robotic festival at IIT... - Aren't you surprised? ...three years ago. But this genius pitched a presentation, and it was clear to me. Exactly in that moment, I knew that this robot will take the Unicorn Group to great heights. Sir, thank you so much. I'm nothing but an ordinary horse, you're the jockey who guided me to this point. Not a horse, a Unicorn. Of course. - Jayant, show us your magic. - Sure, sir. He is... Jayant is Johnny. For me, he's Johnny. My childhood friend from school. I'm also helping him to make rocket. And look at him today... Dad... Thank you. - Surprise! Congratulations, baby! - Hi. Wow! - Okay. Sir. - Dad, bye. Why didn't you tell me about the promotion? - Come. - Why did I have to hear it from Dad? It came as a surprise to me as well. Don't lie. He tells you everything. Come back before 10:30 pm, and come back sober. Do you understand? - Let's go, dear. - Go with your mother. Mr. Adhikari is walking your way. Good for him. He needs the exercise. A father should bless his son, not console him. Wow, Dada, you're a rock star. Now we'll have to get used to calling you sir. Not at all. Hey, Johnny Arkhedkar. Board of Director. Slaying! - Here, for you. - What is this? I brought it for you on your birthday, but you're always so busy. No, it's okay. You forgot your friend, but I still remember you. Please take it. He got it specially for you. Jayant sir, it's time for the performance. Okay. Right. Guys, please have a seat. The show is about to start. Come on, let's get a drink. Yes, one second.

You quit smoking for my promotion? Sweet. Jay, you're going to be a dad. Fuck! You almost got me for a second there. Hey, Monica. Are you crazy? Okay, listen. I have friend in Bombay who is a doctor. She's a gynecologist. Let's consult her. You get an abortion done. All right? You get an abortion done. I'm keeping the baby. Why? Don't say "why?" Ask "how?" We fucked, and that's how. Monica, you know, right? I can't marry you. I can't! I've been taking care of myself since I was 13. - I'll take care of this baby, too. - Stop this bullshit! Don't sit here and tell me your sad story, right? And what if someone in the office finds out? And what if Adhikari sir finds out? Oh, fuck! Jay. Jay, listen, don't worry. You get married to Nikki. You get married to Nikki. Become the CEO's son-in-law. I... I'll handle this alone. Nobody needs to know. But, you know how expensive things have become? But, thank God, you earn well. Now, see, maternity, delivery, and to keep all this a secret, I'll have to take break for a few years, right? And school, etc. It's all so expensive... Are you blackmailing me? What? Fuck... Do you know what blackmail is? Do you want me to blackmail you, tell me? Should I write an anonymous letter? "Guess who's fucking who this week newsletter?" Should I? Pick it up. Who is it? Take the call. You won't accept the responsibility. At least accept the call. - Be quiet... - I'll be silent. Hello? Yes, baby. No, actually, I came home. Why are you not here? You know this is important to me, Jay. Yeah, I'm coming in ten minutes. I love you. Bye. I love you. Hello? Nikki, I have to tell you something. Tell me, Jay. I grew up in a very small town. You wouldn't even know it, Angola. Angola? Sounds exotic. My dad was a mill-worker and my mother used to stitch fall-beading into sarees. It was a simple life, simple family. But I had to get out of there. From the hopelessness of the middle class. I worked hard, studied harder. Then I got a scholarship and went to IIT. Then I met your father, and suddenly my life took a whole new turn. I'm so proud of you, Jay. Nikki, all this money, this lifestyle, it all happened so suddenly for me. It's quite overwhelming. I had never seen this, never had this. You know, sometimes when you are young and stupid, you get carried away in flow. Sorry, Jay. This is my cousin Vinny. - I have to take it. - Yes. She just found out her fiancé is cheating on her. Hello, babe, stop it, no crying. No crying. Stop it! Dad knows people. We'll kill him. All right? No, man, this is not just cheating, it's disgusting! He can't get away with it. We'll dump his ass in prison. We know what happens to manicured guys like him in prison. I have watched the Netflix documentaries. Okay? Trust me. You're fine? Okay. Good. Nothing. I'm with Jay. He's not like that. He's the best. Now you take care. Okay? I'm gonna call you. Bye. She's a mess. - What were you saying? - What? You were saying something. No, what was I... It was nothing. Okay. Misal? How do you know? What... What happens to manicured men in jail? Forget it. He's a dead man. He'll be given a muddy manicure. Hi. This is a small petition. Look. If you sign it, everything will be fine. You are on the board of directors now. Okay? So, they'll have to take your signature seriously... Get out. I told you earlier. If the hearts of the rich decay, the poor lose their shit. You are a good fellow. You're not corrupt. Do the right thing! Johnny, did you like the watch? - Watch? - The gift I gave you at the party. Oh, yeah, that watch. - Yes, it was nice. I'll wear it. Thanks. - You didn't wear it. Morning, sir. Sir... Sir... Sir, I was here... Sir... May God Indra of great fame bless us. Thank you, guys. Enough, go to work now. - Wasn't this a nice surprise, Dada? - Yes. Here, this is from me. - A frog? - No, it's a prosperity charm. Keep it properly. It's for good luck. This is your mail. Dada, by next week, the voice automated system will be installed. Blinds, lights, music, everything will be on voice command. If you face any issues, just let me know. I'll fix it. I have brought all your stuff here. See this, Dada. Your factory jacket. So sweet. Your friends from the factory sent it. But now you've become a white collar man. Whose photographs are these? Can you get back to work? Don't stand here and talk nonsense. What? You're my sister at home, not in the office. Just leave. Sorry, sir. Shut the door! Fuck, man! 303. Hello. Hi. Nishi, it's not what it looks like. You see, there is some misunderstanding. See... I don't give a fuck that you're fucking Monica. I don't even give a fuck about my sister, nor my father. You can fuck my father also. - No, I'm not. - Thanks, buddy, thanks. I'm not here to fucking blackmail you. But let me make something clear. I hate you, Jayant Arkhedkar. You are a fucking pretender. A parasite. All these snazzy fucking clothes and these white keds and this very awful perfume that you're drenched in, it won't make you one of us. You're still the same guy. The fresh prince of Angola. Scum, motherfucker! What's the matter? Feel like crying? Now, why am I here in this fucking shithole wasting my time? - Why? - Why? 'Cause you're going to kiss my ass. 'Cause I'm going to save yours. How? That bitch is blackmailing me too. The same "I'm pregnant with your child" bullshit. Monica is blackmailing you? - Why the fuck are you smiling? - I'm not smiling. - Is it a joke? - Monica is blackmailing you? What is he doing here? Monica told him that she is carrying Arvind Junior in her womb. Right? This asshole is also in the same boat. - Him? - Yes. Who sleeps around with accounts department? Hey, Jay! Don't underestimate the accounts department. Okay? That's not the point. The point is that I'm a family man. Monica and I went to Goa for a conference. We got drunk and I passed out. I don't want to be blackmailed for the sex I don't even recollect. You're right, Jay. Accounts department can't get involved in this. I love only, and only, Savitri. Who is Savitri? She's my wife. See? - Of course, I know her. - What? - How come? - Shut up! Just fucking shut up. Fuck. Did either of you have a solution for this problem? We'll sue her. No problem. Blackmail is crime. Law will take care of her. - You'll sue her for blackmailing? - Yes, absolutely. Why not? I'll give you 30 seconds. Go into the future, think about this scene, and then come back and tell me. Okay? Okay. Mississippi one. Mississippi two. Mississippi three. Sorry. How about if we get someone to threaten her? Yes, Tamang! - Yeah, Tamang is a good option. - One, two, three, four! He seems like a gangster. As I see it, there's only one option. The last option. Are you crazy, Nishi? Suicide? - Murder. - Murder? Whose? Fuck! Tell him whose murder. Whose, Jay? He is talking about Monica. Damn it! What happened to the power? I will kick their ass if it won't return back. Don't worry. Power will be back shortly. Every room has a candle. You'll both live dual lives. The family, society and office one and the other with Monica. Whenever the phone rings, you get a text, you'll withdraw money from the bank. The wife will check your phone. You might get away a couple of times. Perhaps, you'll even buy a second phone. Somehow, you'll hide the bank statements. You'll manage somehow and open a new account in another bank. You'll escape getting caught at the last moment. Even your accountant will start doubting you along with your wife. Then you'll decide to do cash transactions only. Maybe Monica will ask you to move her to the US or buy her a plot in Goa. Or maybe she'd want to marry you, seeing your sincerity at work. Because you might make good husbands and great fathers. Because y'all are nice guys. Then one day she will ask you to marry her. Divorce Savitri. Then, you'll offer her more money. But now, Monica does not want money. She wants your affection, your care. Because y'all are nice guys. And one day, Savitri will find out everything. Nikki too. My father, the great Adhikari as well. That his two blue-eyed and incorruptible middle class boys have sinned and taken unaccounted money from the company and broken his trust. In less than six months, you'll be fired, exposed, your whole life will be flushed down the drain. And that's the truth. When everything is ruined, you'll come to me, and say that we should kill Monica. After six months, when you have nothing? Or now? When you have everything. Queen... Monica. Jack will dispose. King will transport. - And Ace will kill. - Can you elaborate please? Did you ever run the relay race in school? One person takes the baton and runs, hands it to the second one, who hands it to the third. But this time, we'll not be passing any baton. It'll be Monica's dead body. Pick. If I go first, there is only 33,33% chance of committing murder. Is that okay with you? Okay? I dealt the coins... so I'll pick last. You have 50-50 probability. Use it. Perfect. Anyway, I didn't think you guys had the balls to kill. Before proceeding, I need something from the both of you. A fail-safe. What? I'll carry out the murder, but if you two chicken out at the end, then? I'm not going to take the fall for it. "Murderers agreement." "We, Nishikant Adhikari, Jayant Arkhedkar and Arvind Manivannan agree to kill Ms. Monica Macha do." Do you want Savitri to divorce you? You know why my father loves you? Because you've come from nowhere. And you'll do anything to make it. Just like he did. And you know why he hates me? Because I have everything, and no garbage to get out of. You are his real heir, Jayant Arkhedkar. He is just like my dad. This stays with me. So, here's the plan. I'll call Monica to Bombay, and she'll show up. You know why? Because I'll promise her money. But I'll kill her. And wrap her body in a tarpaulin and keep it in a van. Jay, you'll go with Nikki to my grandpa's lake, at Devlali. After putting Nikki to sleep, you'll come to Bombay by train. Then, you go to the Inamdar Mills warehouse. Get the van with Monica's body in it and take it to Khandala. Arvind will meet you there. You hand over the body to Arvind. Arvind, you will dispose of the body in the jungle. Jay, then you'll go to Bombay from Khandala, drop the van at Inamdar Mills, catch a train from CST back to Devlali, and then to my grandpa's lake before Nikki wakes up. Simple.

All you've shown me is a dog, nothing else. Supri. Your love beguiled me immensely We came to hunt But were hunted instead That's right! This is how the dead body was wrapped in a yellow tarpaulin before leaving it in the forest for wild animals. How did Nishikant Adhikari reach the black valleys of Khandala? What was the will of destiny? Anyway, what is the mystery behind Nishikant's death? Stay tuned to find out. It's a conspiracy. And I'm also its victim. It wasn't a leopard, but a human who killed Nishi. I'm sure about it. Look, I've worked here for 25 years. I know everyone. Everyone knows me. The only person I do not know... is Jayant. Please cooperate with us. - And don't forget the bank statement. - Yeah. Thank you. Shalu. What are they saying? Any suspects? Did they find anything? Some lead, documents, or something? I mean, any agreements, documents, or something? Nothing was found at Nishi sir's place. But... people are saying he was a high roller at casinos. So it might have something to do with gambling debts. They've asked for his bank statements. - I'll... - It's possible, right? - Yes. You go and get it. - Okay. - Bye. - Take care. Eat on time. Okay? And call me if anything happens. Police protect and serve us. I also do service, sir. You can call me at any time. But not after 10 o'clock because I am a family man. What do you think? Who did it?

Fiancé would be Nishikant's sister, right? Yes. So, after Nishikant's death, the entirety of Unicorn will be hers solely. So after your wedding, if something happens to the girl, then... Ka-ching, Ka-ching, Ka-ching Ka-ching, Ka-ching I brought my tech to this company. I've worked hard and it has earned the company a lot. Very good. But I didn't say you had a hand in it. I heard that you and Nishikant were not on good terms. Like a mongoose and a snake. Like, I'm your enemy, you're my foe. What animosity? And who told you this? Forget it. Do one thing. Hand over your passport. Take his passport. And you're to stay in Pune until the investigation is over. Oh, my God! I'll bring flowers for you on 14th February, in Yerawada Central Jail.

But you take care of Nikki. - Okay, sir. - She's taken this too hard. Okay, I'm on it, sir. You take care. Nikki, are you all right? Do I look sad? I'm trying my best to look sad, Jay. Do I look sad? You lost your brother. Of course, you're sad, aren't you? I wanna be honest with you. Can I be honest with you, Jay? Yes. I'm not really sad. I'm glad the fucker is dead. It's good that he died. Good riddance. We didn't get along anyway. He's not even my real brother. You know that, right? He was dad's son from some previous marriage. Dad left his mom for my mom. And she hated him for that. And the fucker hated me. Now all he ever wanted to do was mess with daddy and his reputation. Dad was dad. Loved him anyway. Just kept pretending as one big happy family and everything is rosy among us. Listen, how is your cousin? Vinny had some problem, right? Did you talk to her? I hope she is okay. She is fine. See, this is why I love you. With everything going on, you're worried about Vinny and her heartbreak. - I'm gonna call and tell her. - Yes, call her. I'll be right back. Okay, Jay. I'll come. Arvind sir? Jay. Yeah? Shut the door. - What did she tell you? - You first. She told me nothing, we were just lighting the candles. - What did she tell you? - That the cutlet is not tasty. But the samosas are good. - Samosa... - She is playing with us, Jay. She is playing with us. Stop your drama. Control yourself. We have not done any murder. - We'll go to the police, surrender... - Are you crazy? If you ever speak about the murder again, I'll bury you... Hey, Gaurya. I know, Arvind, it's sad. But, after all, Nishi's... Listen, we need to be strong. Okay? For sir. Come. It's okay. Come on. Did you eat? Have the samosas... they're good. Come, Arvind. - Don't cry. It's fine. Come. - So sad. Do they think the police are stupid? Worship Govinda, Worship Govinda Worship Govinda, O deluded mind Worship Govinda, O fool Rules of grammar will not save you At the time of your death Rules of grammar will not save you... - Dad, chocolates! - Dad, chocolates! - Dad, chocolates! - Dad, chocolates! - Hey! - Chocolates! Chocolates... Come here, guys! "Thank you for attending the memorial service of Mr. Nishikant Adhikari." I have been trying to record a video since morning! I help you do your hair. I help you with your homework. Mummy is recording a video, right? - Why can't you guys keep it down? - Savitri! Arvind! Yes, tell me, Shalu. - Brother, please turn on the news. - What's wrong? Dada, please watch the news right now. Okay, I'm checking it out. - Stop crying, I'm checking it out. - I'm not crying. There's something about them... Why the fire always keep burning... This is the second, yes, the second tragic attack on the Unicorn Board. On the CFO of Unicorn, Arvind Manivannan. An anonymous parcel was sent to his home. The children thought there'd be chocolate inside it. But, no. What came out of it was a venomous cobra. We have a snake specialist, Nagesh, with us here, who will tell us how the cobra's venom enters into our body and affects us. Mr. Nagesh? Then cobra... dissolves into... and the person dies. There are various types of snakes available in Maharashtra. Some of them are dangerous, and some are not so dangerous. But we should not be scared of snakes. But this doesn't mean we can become friendly with them. Paying homage to all of my teachers, here I am presenting Kusumagraj's poem for my dear friends. Sir, did you identify me when someone came to you in the rain, clothes were crumpled and my hair was wet. Sat for a moment and smiled then spoke. Guest Gangamai came and left after staying in the nest. It's three o'clock! Go to sleep! No, no! You go and sleep. What's happening here? Sir, did you identify me when someone came to you in the rain, clothes were crumpled and my hair was wet. The world has collapsed, but my spine is still intact. Just pat my back and ask me to fight. The world has collapsed, but my spine is still intact. Just pat my back and ask me to fight. The world has collapsed, but my spine is still intact. Just pat my back and ask me to fight. The world has collapsed, but my spine is still intact. Just pat my back and ask me to fight. The world has collapsed, but my spine is still intact. Just pat my back and ask me to fight. The world has collapsed, but my spine is still intact. Just pat my back and ask me to fight. The world has collapsed, but my spine is still intact. Just pat my back and ask me to fight. The world has collapsed, but my spine is still intact. Just pat my back and ask me to fight. The world has collapsed, but my spine is still intact. I made a mistake, sir. Please, I'm really sorry. You have gone on a dark path, my son. I'm speaking the truth, sir. The festival of Nag Panchami is around the corner. So I caught a few snakes from the village. All the six snakes were stolen before I could extract their venom. I've also suffered a loss, sir. I swear to God. I haven't sold the snakes to anyone. Madam, please let me go. Please, sir, let me go. Please. Madam? I think he's telling us the truth. I trust everyone on Mondays. Should I let him go? Leave. Pick it up. - Okay, sir. - Go. - Goodbye, madam. Goodbye, sir. - Yeah. Go. Madam, I told you the other day that Jayant is the one who killed Arvind. I overheard him threatening Arvind, "I will kill you." Sir... You know that I don't respect anyone else more than you. You are family to me, right? It's my fault. I should've told you everything before. - Good morning, Mr. Jayant. - Morning. Come, Tamang. Sir, you had your 11:00 a.m. medicine? Sorry, I forgot. - It... - I'll take it. What's the big deal? No, sir, you'll take it right now. - You... - Here. Sorry. Here, sir. Sir, you know how important you are for us. So many weird things are happening in the office. After all, you are like our father. Isn't it, Mr. Jayant? Yeah, of course. Tea? Sir. Tea? No, I'm good. Thank you. It's just tea, not poison. Have it. Tea will get cold. Go on. Have your tea. Drink now. Actually, I have a conference call. I'll be back. Jayant? You were about to say something. That you can trust me. I have nothing to do with these murders. I'm innocent. And I promise you, sir, I'll never let anything tarnish Unicorn's or my reputation. That's my boy. What a lovely man. I know everything... Come to the terrace if you want the agreement Motherfucker. Fuck you, Monica! The heart is very small, but... His dreams are very big He wants to touch the skies While standing on the ground Just the fake coins System down. Fill my pockets - Ma'am, it has come up. - Yes! But the dough you find on the road They will be the real ones A little bit of attraction More of a fantasy A little bit of attraction More of a fantasy You cheat yourselves sometimes The heart fights with itself He wants to touch the skies While standing on the ground A little bit of attraction More of a fantasy A little bit of attraction More of a fantasy The heart is very small, but... Its dreams are very big He wants to touch the skies While standing on the ground While standing on the ground There... Kulfi? While standing on the ground While standing on the ground Hey! Jay! Hey. That... - Do you have tissue paper? - We didn't come here to talk to you. Seems like we should talk now. Sure. We can talk. Coffee? Oh, kulfi. Crow got you, right? It's your lucky day. - Why are you panting? - Panting? Well, I'm doing 10,000 steps. Five hundred more to go. Let's go. See you. What are you doing here? Shalu... had called for snacks... Go to the factory. Come on. While standing on the ground While standing on the ground Fuck, a photocopy? Fuck you, Monica! Hi, Monica. I was around. Can we meet? You're behaving very formal these days. Do you really need an appointment to meet me? What to do, Monica? That's what our relationship is like now. Yeah, that's true. Come. Coming. Hungry, right? Ordered food from Saleem's. Do you like Saleem's? Yeah, I love Saleem's. You like Monica? Say, "Monica, oh, my darling." Just say it! "Monica, my love." Okay, come here. Nice, isn't it? What do you think? Come. I've bought it all on monthly installments. I'll forward the invoice. Pay for it when you get it. Why are you playing these games, Monica? Games? Hey, Jayant Arkhedkar. I'm not playing games, okay? I'm tired, man. "Monica, do this. Monica, do that." "Yes, sir. Of course, sir." I'm fed up with this shit. Listen, man. Just listen to me. I also want to do what I want, I want to buy what I like. But not everyone is as lucky as you. I'm not lucky, okay? I've worked hard. You've worked hard? What do you think? At your IIT Festival, the boss offered the job to 16 people before you. You were 17th. You got lucky because the other 16 had better job offers than you. Those 16 assholes wanted to work their ass off in a multinational company. But I wanted to build my own empire. Jay, what do you think of yourself? That you're talented? It's not about the talent, it's about how good your story is. See, Adhikari had a great story when he came to meet BD Inamdar. That's all he needed. Father-in-law's fund is all you need. I didn't beg for it. I came with my tech, got it? Hey, whatever you wanna believe, okay? But the truth is, Jay, on the inside, you're still the same poor boy from Angola, baby. Belonging nowhere. Desperately ass-licking your way to the top. I'm just hopping along for the ride, baby. Fuck you, man! "Fuck you"? Did you say "fuck you"? How dare you say "fuck you"? How dare you say "fuck you"? What are you doing? - Fuck you, bitch! - What are you doing? Why are you taking your clothes off? Are you gonna kill me? Then kill me! Kill me, asshole! Enough, Monica! That's enough! Monica. Monica? Monica? Monica. Sorry. Sorry. Why did you stop? Fuck Unicorn, fuck the money. I don't want anything. I'm going to the police. I'll tell them the truth. Tamang is also involved, right? I'll make him pay, too. Stop crying, man! Just stop it! Just going on about murder. Whose murder? Nishi's murder. Arvind's murder. You tried to kill me twice. You are mad or what? Why would I kill you? Or Arvind or Nishi for that matter. If you die, who pays me? You did not kill Nishi? The day Nishi was murdered, he asked me to come to Mumbai. I went there to meet him. But he didn't show up. He didn't answer my calls or my texts. So I came back to Pune. Jay, I didn't kill anyone. Sorry, Monica. I made a big mistake. - Hush. - Kill me if you want to. Stop crying. I forgive you. Hey, Jay. In my life, I've seen bigger monsters than you. And listen, I never blackmailed you or anyone else. I'm just collecting my... Fuck! GST, excise, service tax from the people. I think I deserve it. But you don't have to agree with me. No, you are right, Monica. Thank you. Actually, now I know who's behind all of this. Who is it? Your phone is ringing. Answer it. It's Nikki's. Leave it. I'll call her back later. Never miss Nikki's call. She is very important for us. Take the call. I'll call her later. We've got the whole night. I'll tell you. Now we are in this together, right? You know about it? - Yeah, baby. - Jay, where are you? Why didn't you come home? Jay, everyone is dying. Every day, here somebody is dying. You are not dead, right? Jay, are you fucking even alive? Tell me where you are. I'm coming to you. Sorry. I was about to come. - Where are you? I'm coming there now. - Yes. 30 minutes, okay? Jay, I can't wait. I had a dream. I had a dream that someone fucking killed you. She took a knife and put it in your head like you're a fucking pumpkin. - Tell me where you are. I'm coming. - It's okay. Why, Nikki? You know you can't handle it. You... Are you fucking driving? Nikki, stop the car. I was flying, Jay. I was fucking flying like Back to the Future. Are you getting me? Tell me where you are. Nikki, you... Nikki. Yogesh, please give me my glasses. - Does that even happen? - I have seen it all. - Fuck it, come! - What, fuck it? Come on, no. - Come on, man! - No, I'm leaving. - Let's have pizza. - What should I do then? - Come on. - I'm leaving. No! Yogesh! My stick. Ms. Monica Macha do. I'm shocked. I am shocked! What the hell is happening in Unicorn? If you've got a clue, let me know. I have no clue at all. Sometimes, I think... I might be the next one. No, sir. Don't say such things. You will be fine. You will long live. Sure. Right, sir. Shalu, cancel all my meetings today. What's wrong? Dada, you are a murderer. You will rot in hell. Did you have wine yesterday? No. Thank God! Otherwise... Monica's wine had the snake venom, too. Someone injected it through the cap. Snake venom. I was six, when some asshole put a snake inside my school bag. On my way home, it came out of the bag and coiled itself on my neck. Since then I have ophidiophobia. Phobia of snakes. I'm afraid of snakes. This... Sorry. Shende, did I accuse him of this? No. Okay. Never ever narrate a back story so perfectly. The more a story is perfect, the more... - Doubt. - Yes, doubt. Give a little slack to the story. With feelings. The thing is, the beauty of humanity lies in its small mistakes. Seasoned criminals know this very well. Inexperienced criminals keep a tight hold on everything. But... He gets caught! Where were you at the time of Monica's murder? When did the murder take place? Between 12:30 to 01:20. I was asleep at home. What? Make a wish. But later. Take this eyelash. It's called DNA sample. Monica was pregnant, right? We'll match yours and the child's DNA. Shende, did Nishikant's or Arvind's DNA match? - No. - No? You're going to win the lottery. Sir, I haven't killed Monica. At least you trust me, right, sir? Now even Shalu thinks that I've killed Monica. Look, Jayant. Shalu found a file. Sorry. Who knows what she might be going through after reading the file. What file, sir? The investigation report of Dev Prakash's death. The one prepared by Nishi. In which you were held responsible for the robot's malfunction. All the directors wanted to fire you. It's possible, Jayant. It's a machine, it can malfunction. Then my career is over, sir. I was sure you had nothing to do with it. So, I took care of it personally. Don't worry. I'm with you. But Faridi? It was either you or him. And you know, I will always choose to save you. Do something. Go on a vacation. Take a leave. I'm benching you, not removing you from the team. Faridi... I'm so sorry. I'm responsible for whatever happened to you. The robot I made, it malfunctioned. To save me, they made you... Are you stupid? Maybe. Don't you trust your own robots? This is a conspiracy. And I'm saying this from the beginning that Dev Prakash's death was not an accident. He was murdered. Someone killed him on purpose. Maybe it was an attempt to implicate you. But it was me who got implicated. Tamang? Our Johnny? Shalu, I can't even imagine that Johnny can do such a thing. Thank God, you didn't give the file to the police. Everything is being controlled by the management, Shalu. One of my friends is well-connected with the media. Let's give the file to him. - Then we'll see... - Shalu! Shalu. Get out. - Get out! - Shalu. What are you doing here? And why did you leave the door open? - Get out. - You think it was me, right? You think it was me, right? Go ahead. I'd have killed myself if I'd been responsible for Dev's death. Don't lie. It's not a lie, Shalu. It's a conspiracy to destroy me. Everyone is targeting me. I've found out, Shalu. The man responsible for Dev's death. Who? Tamang. Tamang? Captain Zattack? He manually controlled the robots to kill Dev. Then Nishi and he forged these reports. To implicate me. I also think he's the one who killed Monica and Arvind. But, Johnny, police didn't find any entry for manual control of the robot. I showed them in the ledger myself. Maybe he deleted it. That asshole doesn't know those robots are mine. I can hack and retrieve the entire deleted directory anytime. Hari om Praise Vithhal Vitthal We won't live this life again Hari om Praise Vithhal Vitthal We won't live this life again Hari om Praise Vithhal Vitthal We won't live this life again It's loading. What have you done? Are you calling Shalu? Johnny? Hey, I know you can hear me. Listen! I'm the one who killed Nishi. Arvind, too. No. It wasn't me who killed Monica. Even that job was offered to me. But I refused. Don't get confused. Try to understand the chronology. That day Dev broke my heart. So I took over the machine's manual control and broke Dev's neck. It was necessary to kill him. It's not like I didn't feel guilty. I left with the thought that let bygones be bygones. But I was not alone there. Sir. Nishi saw me. I myself came here to set everything on fire. I love Shalu, sir. Yeah. I can see that! Nishi made me sit next to him. As an equal. Talked and laughed. He let me drink his imported whiskey. - I liked it. He seemed like a nice man. - Don't worry, okay? Because of the respect he gave me, I did everything he asked me to. But one night, he crossed the limit. He said, "Kill Monica." I told I won't commit murder. Even I have some self-respect. And I was happy with Shalu anyway. But then he said something that I didn't like. He said, "I'll tell Shalu everything." Asshole. He pushed the wrong button. So he had to die. Then I found your murderer's agreement on Nishi. I thought if I let you people go, you'll also threaten to tell Shalu everything. But later I got to know that you had no idea about me at all. Because I'm invisible to you all. Invisible! I thought I'm like a fucking God. I can kill anyone, anytime, anyhow, and nobody would know. But there is someone more powerful than me, Johnny. The one who killed Monica. Finally. I'm trying to find out who he is. After you, I'll kill him too. Then my Shalu, me, and our life. Goodbye, Johnny. Hey, Gaurya! Are you crazy? Gaurya, please stop. Gaurya, have you gone mad? Gaurya, stop it! Hey, Gaurya! Gaurav! Please! Gaurav, please! Johnny, Johnny! Hey, what is this, Johnny? What is this? Johnny? What is this? Is this your tech? Asshole, you're laughing? Johnny! Johnny, let me go! No! - This is my tech. - Let go, Johnny! Dada, I don't want to stay here. I'm quitting this job and going back. This is not your fault, Shalu. Everything is going to be fine now. The worst is behind us. You'll stay with me now. Sorry. I've packed everything. Shampoo, soap, towel, perfume. I'm telling you, Shende. Jayant Arkhedkar can't commit murder. Look. How could he do it? It was self-defense, right? - Yes. - So tell me how it happened. Gaurav had totally lost it. First, to get Shalu, he... Shalu is my sister. He killed Dev to get her. Then he grew fond of killing. He told me many times that the top management is responsible for his poverty. I tried a lot to make him understand. He started killing everyone. Nishi, Arvind, Monica. Then he tried to kill me, too. He told me that the CEO was his next target. He had become a psycho. Ass... Sorry. Thank God my sister is safe. Hey, not again. Why do you keep such a tight hold on every bit of the story? Give it some slack. This is not a story. And I'm not a slacker. Neither am I, you punk. Monica's murder. - It was not Gaurav. - Meaning? It could be anyone... But it wasn't Gaurav. Is that so? How can you be so sure? Not me, her. Who? The old lady who stays at Monica's building! Witness! I see. Did this old lady see someone? But she... I mean, did she see who did it? No. She can't see. She has cataracts in both her eyes. But for the last 30 years, she's selling perfume at the airport. So she identified the killer's perfume in an instant. That wasn't Yogesh. Notorious Noir Extreme. I'm impressed. What? But I don't have a keen eye. But you have a keen nose. Millions of people use it. It's very popular. Several colleagues use it. What? What? You've turned it into CSI: Pune. Perfume... And the old lady heard the killer's voice. She also touched his face. I'll round up all the Notorious Noir Extremes and make them march. Let's go. - Dada. - Shalu, I'll call you in two minutes. Tamang killed Monica! I'm so sorry, Dada. I was so wrong about you. You were absolutely right. Please forgive me. I'm sending the link to you. - Send it. - Yes, see. Got it. Mr. Tamang Rana used Gaurya More's murders as an opportunity to silence Ms. Monica Macha do. Monica was pregnant with Tamang's child which Tamang didn't want... the world to know. So he poisoned Ms. Machado's wine with snake venom. But guilt got the better of him and he committed suicide by consuming the same poison. Mr. Adhikari, would you like to say something? Inspector Naidu has done a fabulous job solving this case. And we are already cooperating with her every way we can. These are very unfortunate events. And I hope the company will be able to put these behind us and start afresh. My sincere condolences to the families of the dead. May they all rest in peace. I thought I lost you. But Dad promised me that this will never happen. Sir, can we give Faridi his job back? Absolutely. And, sir... You must have several questions. But I would advise you to think about your future. The more you'll try to solve it, the more you'll be entangled. Just stay with my family. As a Unicorn. As my son. Adhikari was right. Don't think too much. Tamang killed Monica, Gaurav killed Nishi and Arvind. Case closed. Can I ask you something? But please tell me the truth. Was Monica pregnant? You want the truth? Tell me something. Had Monica given birth to a child, what would the child be to you? Maybe a son or daughter. Brother-in-law or sister-in-law. We have to do something about Monica, Tamang. Now she is threatening to tell Nikki everything. Don't worry, sir. I take care. Sir, that promise to include me in the board of directors. And those shares as well. Sir, I think it is now... long due, isn't that right, sir? Hello? We have to take care of Tamang, Naidu. He couldn't even graduate high school and now he wants to be on the board of directors. Why am I not surprised? Close all accounts once and for all. Right. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Hey, listen. Don't slack at all this time. Hold onto everything really tight. If something comes out later, it will wreak havoc. You know, there's no one else left to die besides you. You better not die. You are the future of Unicorn. And potentially, my most valuable customer. It will be... my pleasure to do business with you. One day. - Hello. - Jay. Remember Vinny? My cousin? Hi! Who is she? You know who she is. Give us a minute. Vinny, cousin? Yeah, of course. - How are you? - Hi, I'm good. - Hi. - Hi. She is glowing, right? I'll just come. - Yeah, baby. - Where are you, Jay? You just disappeared. I came to Angola, you know. - Angola? - Our family goddess is here. - So I thought I'll pay my respects. - Right. I was so stressed. Everything is sorted out now. Okay. Coming home for dinner? Dad is waiting. Sure. I'll be back by dinnertime. Okay. Love you. - I love you. Bye. - Bye. ANGOLA - Hi, baby. - Hi, baby. When are you coming? - Done paying your respects? - Coming in ten minutes. - Okay. Dad wants to talk to you. - I'll... - Son, not Nikki, it's Satyanarayan here. - Hello, sir. Sir, I'll be there in ten minutes. - Waiting for you for dinner. - Okay, sir. I love you. - Sorry. Bye, sir. - I love you too. Subtitle translation by: Shrey Ravi
