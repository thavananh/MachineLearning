Oh, Ms. Todd. I'm a huge fan, I love your work. [Thelma] Well, thanks, darling. Let me ask, what's your favorite movie of mine? Uh, all of them? [Thelma chuckles] That's nice to hear. -I appreciate the comp-- -Ms. Todd. You're needed. Let me finish my martini. Now! [music continues] What do you want, Lucky? I wanted some company. Is that a crime? Be gentle, you fool! She's a star and should be treated as such. My apologies, Mr. Luciano. Such a talent. Look at this face. It's like she didn't even want it. What are you doing here, Lucky? Prohibition is over and the cops are upstairs getting drunk. New enterprise. [mysterious music] Have a little. We don't agree on anything anymore. Where I come from, we have a saying. "If it's not broken, don't fix it." This spot works. You've gotta get with the times, toots. Just like you with the talkies. Yeah, well, there's plenty of other places. It doesn't have to be in my backyard. You're my lucky lady. You're gonna give me trouble? I made this face. Who gave you your first part in that movie? [dramatic music] [music increases] I was wondering if you were just going to keep me here all night. Sorry. I was just-- I was cleaning out my closet. I found a moth's nest.

You know, I was thinking about the girl you was when I found you in that club. Tap dancing? I took you out of a joint like that and said you could own a joint like this. -Remember? -Yeah. And you're a star to boot. And who do you think you have to thank for that? You, Lucky. Yeah, you see, but I don't feel very thanked. Maybe it's time to give another girl a chance.

Are you saying you aren't my best bro? Of course, dude, but there's hot babes on the beach and you made me look like a total barney, man. Okay, bro. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I'm the better surfer. [laughing] Come on, bro, I'm killing babes! [laughing] [cheerful music] -What's up, Radman? -What's up, Shawn? -What's going on, brother? -Dude, Taylor being harsh, bro? It's like one should acknowledge it sometimes, you know? Yeah. [cheerful music] Beast! No, no, no.

Get out of here! -I'm about to beat you. -[beatboxing continues] [cheerful music] [sighs] Whoa, dude! No way! What? Did you find out that Radman's girlfriend was actually a man? Who, Donald? I mean, Donna. No, dude, shut up! We just scored a free house! Dude, she was the greatest thing that ever happened to me, bro. -We just scored free house. -What are you talking about? I guess my grandpa had a will, and when he died, he left his house to me. -[Shawn] Wait, Grandpa Herman? -Yep! Didn't he criminally get banned from your high school for yelling obscenities at the ref during that championship game? -I love that guy! -Yeah, that's him. He was a little crazy from time to time. But you gotta love old Grandpa Herms. Wait, where is this place, man? It says here it's located on the hill overlooking the water in the Pacific Palisades. -What? Shit! -We never really went over there. I heard about it as a kid, my parents always said it was a strange house. Weird energy. I guess he bought this spot when he was younger and never decided to sell. -Sick! -Holy shit, guys! Check out these pictures! This thing is massive. I just don't trust it, man. Alien cover ups, UFOs, Nephilim conspiracies. This is-- a massive mansion doesn't just fall in our laps, dudes. Bro, not like we have a better option. -Yeah, man. -[deeply inhales] Right. Let's do it! ♪ Thank you, California Jesus! ♪ ♪ That is so righteous ♪ [vocalizing] [echoing] You're welcome, bros. Whoa! [heavenly music] Alright, boys. It's time to start a new chapter. -Yeah. -Let's do this. [rock music] Here we are. Casa del babe. [laughing] Dudes, we have arrived! Woah, this is a super slayer lair, bros. Do you guys think this place has a fully operational steam shower? No. Definitely not, you idiot. Maybe a bidet, though. [scoffs] Dumbass. It's like that house in a BILLIONAIRE club magazine. Am I-- am I right? [rock music continues] Oh! [gasps and laughs] Oh, my God! Whoo! [birds chirping] [eerie music] [sighs] We're in heaven, dude. Damn right! [rock music] Welcome to paradise, boys. Now, the staircase is oak, but the fireplace looks like mahogany. It's all good construction. I'll tell you one thing, this place has a ton of hardwood, boys. Yeah, speaking of hardwood, I got one right now. Look at this. Is this embroidery right here? I cannot believe how fantastic this place is. [rattling] [knocking on door] What was that? [birds chirping] [light mysterious music] -[knocking] -Who the hell could that be? Dude, Taylor, don't answer it. Dang it! I knew it was too good to be true. [knocking harder] -Hi. Hey, fellas! -Can I help you? I'm Al, Al Patron. I live around here. -Hey. -It's my neighborhood, so to speak. -[Taylor] Awesome. -Just saw this car parked in front of this empty house. I was wondering, uh, are you the new owners? -'Cause if you are, I wanna welcome you to my neighborhood. -Yep. -Awesome. -Oh, well, that's oddly nice of you. Yeah, I'm Taylor. That's Shawn and Radman. [Shawn] Wait, so you're telling us your first name is Al, like Al Pacino, and your last name just happens to be the same -as the greatest tequila we never had? -Oh! -Sick! Cool! -Awesome! -Wow! -That's pretty cool. Yeah. What about you, "Rad man"? [Radman] Yeah. -That's rad, man! -[Radman] Oh! [shouting] [Radman] That is awesome! -He's hilarious. -You guys look like surfers. If that's true-- I mean, are you guys surfers? 'Cause that would be a crazy coincidence, -'cause I'm a surfer, too. -No way, man, -you're a total barney. Look at you know. -Yes. -No, I'm dead serious. -[Radman] He's cool. You've got a good eye, kid. This is from Barneys. But I like nice things. I can afford them, I'm not ashamed of them. You know, you can be successful and surf these days, like my friend Kelly Slater. -You know who Kelly Slater is? -Th-- Yeah! -The GOAT. The GOAT. Yeah. -Yeah. -"The greatest of all time," Kelly Slater! -He's a friend of mine. -Oh, my gosh. Really? -We're bros. Yeah, we go way back. I almost sold him a house in this neighborhood. -[Radman] Oh! -But you guys know, highest Richter scale. -But, uh, yeah, we go way back. -[Radman] That is righteous, man. -Think he would hang out with us? No. -No. Like, when I first saw his suit, I was like, "This guy is some kind of mafioso, like, under thing." But I still kind of do. But, dude, that is the m-- why don't you come surf with us tomorrow, bro? -[laughs] Yes! -Radman? I would-- I would like to do that. Listen, uh-- -I don't wanna spook you guys. I don't know if you know this... -Yeah. ...but some pretty horrible tragedies took place in this very house. It was a long time ago, but, uh... [deeply inhales] yeah. The old Hollywood Massacre. -What? Are you serious? -Hollywood Massacre? I'm dead serious. It's bad news. -But the good news is, I'm a licensed realtor. -Oh, thank God. -I can help you get out of this haunted death trap... -[Radman sighing] Oh! -...and into a nice new four bedroom mansion. -[Radman] Thank you. -Right on the beach. -[Radman shouts] Yes! Yes! What a blessing. On the beach, even? Thank you, man. Wow! -What a coincidence that you would be here. Oh, my gosh! -Are y-- are you-- Are you a realtor or some, like, con man, dude? What? No, I'm your f-- neighbor. I wanna be friends, I wanna try to help you guys. We're surfers, right? -Yeah. Yeah. -I mean, we look out for each other. We-- I'm not some random guy who drove by and saw your car -and tried to sell your house. -[chuckling] What? -Oh, then what's your address, bro? -Look, I gotta go to this twelve o'clock meeting, I'm kind of late, so I gotta go. It's great meeting you guys, but just think... -He's legit, bro, -...about what I said, okay? Think about what I said. I wanna work with you guys. You think Kelly would hang out with us? If you're with me. Awes-- [sharply inhales] -[ominous white noise] -[gasping] [sharply inhales] [birds chirping] Ciao! Close the door, Radman. -Close the door. -[mumbles] [suspenseful music] Oh! -This is an epic home for our shred space. -Oh! Shred shit. Oh, my God. Look! Old screwdrivers. [chuckles] Dude, look at all this porn, it's surf porn. -Uh-- -Terry Fitzgerald, Rabbit Kekai... -1970s? Oh, my God! -...they're legit, man. -Watch your fricking hands there, dude. -Alright. These are like gold, man, you better wash and dry those things -before you touch these babies. -I just want to borrow a couple of them, dude. -Collector's items, dude. -I don't care about the stupid magazines. [calm music] [clattering] [rattling] Yo, Taylor, come check this out, man. -What is it? Oh. -Some super old film reels. They're legit? -Yeah, they look legit. -Oh! Check it. Old projector! [Radman] Fricking nice, dudes! Great score. You guys are... -...killing it. -Sick! Yo, Radman, what are you doing with those? [stammering] You know, collectio-- his-- history-- there's c-- surf collections we-- -[shouts] Let me sell it! -[Taylor] Yo! -[mumbles] -Yo! [whispers] This is sick. [chiming] -[gunshots] -[chiming] Hey, Shawn, can you get the number for the pizza, dude? -Why can't you do it? -[sighs] You're privy to my schedule. You and I both know I don't have time for that. Fine. But I'm picking the toppings, dude. The Radman cometh with beer. -[clinking] -Ugh! What the hell are those? -[laughs] Hefeweizen, bro. -Hefeweizen? Germany's finest, man. Cost 41 bucks for a six pack. I figured, look, if we're living like kings, might as well be drinking like Bavarian kings! Bro! [scoffs] [snorts] [gasping] Decent. Oh, crap. Well, don't just stare at it, scrub it, you cooch! [chuckling] Alright. -[chiming] -[gunshots] The Radman cometh with aid. Hey, dudes, I got an idea. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? We should watch those old movies we found in the shed. Mm, is that what you were thinking? Sh-- Yeah. Shoot, let's do it. [softly] Okay. Wow, look at this thing! Super prehistoric, huh? -Take that mirror down and plug this in there. -Got you. [soft whirring] [gentle music] -Whoa, who's the foxy blonde? -Woah! Damn, she's gorgeous! The movie reel says it's from 1931. Crazy to think -that she's probably just full Skeletor by now. [chuckles] -[chuckles] [Radman] "By the power of Grayskull." I would totally give her a piece of the Radman. Yeah, I'm sure you would. Too bad she's probably been dead for 80 years. -[laughs] -On second thought, isn't that usually how you prefer your ladies, Radman? -[laughs] -No. Just your mom. -[chuckling] How old is she now, man? -[whirring] [suspenseful music] [Shawn] Great, we pulled a fuse. It was a cold, dark, wet, and rainy night. You couldn't hear a cry for ten miles in each and every direction. She pulls a large butcher knife, then starts slashing and gashing the bros! It was one of the most horrific and horrid slayings of our-- [Radman shouts] Stop it! Please, stop it! Please-- it's not funny, Taylor! [panting] [laughs] I'm just messing with you. Seriously, what just happened? This place has some funky electrical issues. You know what? We should go explore our new hood. Let's get out of this house for a bit, you scared little barneys! -Yeah. -[sighs] [Shawn] This is our new spot, man. [indistinct chatter] [club music] [thunder rumbling] Sick! Dmtina is playing here tomorrow night. And I heard that chick is hot! -[indistinct chatter] -[clinking] Yeah, but that one time, dude, there was a wave, it was like ten foot tall, you guys were going through the barrel, I came over the top and wiped! -[laughs] -Boys, boys, down the hatch, let's go. -Cheers. -Cheers, man. Cheers! [whirring] [grunting] [whirring] -[thuds] -[grunts] We're all getting drained. -Dude. Dude! -I can feel it. Especially me. -Remember that-- -[both laughing] -[laughs] -[Shawn] Guys, enough, -down the hatch, let's do this. -Salud! [clinking] -Oh! -[whirring] -This... -Alright. Let's score -four drinks. -...is epic! -[Radman] Epic! -[whirring] [laughs] Here we go. Salud! [whirring] [thud] [grunting] [clinking] -Woah! -[coughs] -Hi, I'm Radman. -Hi. How are you doing? [cheering] -[shouting] -[whirring] -Chug! Chug! -Go! Time to go! -[cheering] -[hissing] [bell dinging] -[explosion] -[indistinct shouting] [crickets chirping] Man! I drank so much, I'm hallucinating. [eerie music] [groaning] I feel gross. Like I've been at a rave or camping. It's a-- pretty sure one of those girls gave me gingivitis.

Like a force fiel-- it was, like, pushed me underwater, bros. -It was crazy. -Yeah, dude. That's just the depressants in your system creating hallucinations or something, bro. No. I'm very fond of-- I-- I know that feeling, bro. That is not it! Man. I'm scared. [dramatic music] Taylor, can I sleep in your floor? No way, man, you started a fire in my closet last time.

Dude... -Okay, take-- -...I suggest you fork over the sandwich if you don't wanna look like Taylor, dude. How is the sandwich gonna help a cut, bro? I saw this ghostly chick appear in the mirror behind me. She was gnarly white, but hot. [stutters] She was kind of seductive, so I-- I figured that she wanted me, but... [gasps] then it got real fast. I-- I was in some kind of crazy trance. I was paralyzed. I-- I tried to yell but couldn't, she was in total control. Which I, I know I might like in a chick, but this was not the ideal situation, bro. [Radman sighs] Okay. Okay, this is exactly what I was talking about. You guys never listen to the Radman! This chick is in that... [stutters] the necklaces, or something! And if we don't act soon, I feel like we're gonna be adios, mofos, man. I'm serious! [yells] You guys, seriously, you know, chill, dude. -She's real. I'm getting another sandwich-- -You okay, man? Dude, seriously, you guys really think there's a ghost here? Let's hold a séance, let's hold a séance. Why would we hold a séance, bro? He's alive. Dude, a séance, not a vigil, you idiot. -To summon spirits. -Okay. Alright. [grunts] You good? Can you stand up? ["Empty Bones" by The Growlers] Welcome. Read this in a interior decorating magazine, so this should be dead on, man. What we're gonna do is just kind of put our hands on our knees and just suck air in. -Dude, you trying to burn the house down? -Sorry, bro. And when you breathe out, really push all the, like, negativity and, like, you know, the day's, the day's grind-- Ooh, I burned my finger! Dang it, I'm doing it again. Perfect. Just get that burn over the fricking thing! -There we go. -Dude, settle it out. Sorry, bro. Sorry, man. Alright. No worries. No worries. Um, and I've got everything lit. So, um, I just wanna breathe some air in and exhale all of the bad stuff. And maybe if we do that, it'll invite her into this house, man. I really wanna save this chick. Thought she was already in the house. I mean-- [Radman] Join me, guys. Get some "Oms" in there, okay? [all chanting] Om. Excellent job, Taylor. Keep it up. [deeply inhales] [all chanting] Om. [deeply inhales] Om. Where is the hot babe, dudes? I don't know, man. What if we, uh, you guys wanna watch that video and try to see if there's something we missed. Maybe there's something we didn't see before. -Clues? -It's your call, man. This is your guys' gig. ♪ I met you... ♪ Let's do it. Come on. We'll watch the video.

What are you talking about, dude? -This is so bizarre, dude, this is crazy. -[mumbles] There's something to it, man. Necklace. Neck-lace. Necklace. Lace-neck. Lace-neck! Dude, there's something here, man, I can feel it! Some kind of weird energy in this house, bro! This is beyond haunted. What if she's trying to send us a message? From the grave. [loud click] [suspenseful music] Check the room! [loud squeak] [softly] Wha-- Obviously, what's been happening to us is pretty insane. What's this chick's name, anyway? Thelma Todd. It was printed all over those film reel cases. 1931? Thelma Todd? Let me look her up. -[clicks] -[chiming] [clicks] See? [whispers] Dead. [music increases] [soft whirring] [screams] Oh, you guys are getting really good at this. [chuckles] Damn, this is way out of our league. We're gonna need someone who knows how to talk to spirits. -Radman, see if there's a psychic in the area. -Okay. Thelma, guys. Huh, even got an address. Radman to the rescue, huh? [rock music] Hey, guys, over here. Radman! Come, come. I've been expecting you. My name is Bella and I have a box that has been waiting for just the right time. Never been with a physics before, but-- I think there's been some misunderstanding. This is not that kind of establishment. [soft rattling] Boys, there's much more to this box than meets the eye. This box once held a very special necklace. This is what you're looking for. [mysterious chiming] [all] The lions. Look closer. -[softly] Oh! -I can see her. I can see everything. She's running to the woods. There's-- There's a rock, there's-- The rock! Th-- the necklace is in the rock. After you find the necklace, you will need to perform a ceremony to reach Thelma on the other side. I have written everything down for you here. It's called the lions. So what, boys? I mean, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, do you really think there's a ghost in the house -trying to kill us? -Yeah! Radman, you fell asleep in the tub. Taylor, you cut yourself shaving when you were staring at yourself. -Typical. -Bro, you wish! What about the blood on the mirror? You're just messing with me, bro, I'm not buying that. Well, don't think so highly of yourself, alright? We have to find that necklace. [Radman grunts] The waves are calling. [Taylor] Whoa! The waves are going off right now, bro. Change... [stutters] change of plans. Let's go grab our boards and crush this break! For sure! [Radman imitating guitar] Guess what? I'm gonna call Al. He's going surfing with us. Yep!

We gotta have ocean conservation and remove plastic from the environment. I've been saying this all along. Woah. [chuckling] Oh! Oh, my-- John? I love surfing, Radman, there's nothing like it. Dude, exactly! Now, you look ridiculous, but, dude, it don't matter! 'Cause that's what it's about, you gotta keep it up, bro. Oh, my God. We are the biggest fans. We've seen North Shore like a million times. It's on constant rotation at our house. -Best movie ever! -Dude, for real, dude. Too bad this guy doesn't know a thing about big wave riding. -Please drop some knowledge. -Oh, whatever! This guy gets crispy waves and eats it all the time! He's the one that needs some knowledge. -You guys want me to say anything? -No, dude, please get a line in, -dude, please drop a line from North Shore. -Yeah? From North Shore? From North Shore, like, as Turtle, when he's talking to Rick Kane? Yeah? Yeah? No. "If we don't get new wetsuits this winter, we're all going to be cold!"

[birds chirping] That's nothing. -Yeah. -[Al] Alright. Listen, I gotta make this business call, but I wanna try to help you guys understand what a great deal this is, okay? I'm not gonna just leave you in suspense. Yeah, I wouldn't worry about that one, bro. And if you put a bedroom in the kitchen, it's a four bedroom. I'm in. They're idiots. I hate surfers. I'm gonna take them out tonight. I'll make them disappear. [ominous music] Dude, what's taking this cooch so long? Trying to jack some boards or something? [yawning] [sniffs] [Shawn shouts] Holy crap! Radman, Taylor, get in here now! -[screams] -Oh, what the hell happened? Oh, look at his neck! Yeah, look at his head! I mean that's, uh, that's a fin stuck in there, right? [Shawn] Dude, I thought you were the only one who cut deep like that, bro. [Taylor] Uh, we gotta help this guy. Let's get him down. [eerie music] [grunting] [grunting] [thudding] -[sighing] -[Radman] Uh, can we make him comfortable, at least? Can we put his head back or something? Oh, dude, he's pretty done, bro. Yeah.

She was way too hot to go, bros, and way too young to have her light taken out. Let's bring her back, let's save this babe.

[gentle rock music] [crickets chirping] Thelma, if-- if it's not too much to ask, will you please tell us your story? Are you sure you wanna hear it? Yeah. [sighs] Well, there was always more to my death than anybody was willing to explore. The mob wanted to use my restaurant as a front for illegal activities. Racketeering was a big thing at the time. The country was recovering from Prohibition. People wanted to be free. Have a good time. [fire crackling] I understood that. We sold alcohol at the restaurant, but when it was legal. I didn't need the police looking for reasons to shut me down. The mob was willing to take that chance. The local mob boss, Lucky Luciano, stepped up and... ...took me out. The police found me in... ...my car, the engine running... ...and the garage door closed. Made it look like I killed myself. It's just unbelievable. Money was being made hand over fists. I watched the police payoffs, sh-- shady bookkeeping, the rampant extortions. All from the powerless perch of this house. I couldn't leave. It was infuriating. Until... ...I learned I could fight back. [Taylor] Damn. -So-- ugh, so what about Al? -[laughs] Al's grandfather was one of the top Italian mob bosses involved in the cover-ups. "I'll just try to get close to you guys to keep you off the property. -Mask the scent." -[Radman grunts] I sniffed that guy out, day one, man! Like, there's this freaking, gnarly energy out of this dude, and I was like-- I mean, I thought it was kind of harsh to, like, hang him in the surf shed, but-- but now that I know what he did, like, it's, like... ...it's like... ...it's justified, bro. I'm not proud of these actions. They were necessary. [sighs] In this moment, I'm choosing my human form. [mysterious chiming] In this moment... [chuckles] ...I'm free. [ethereal whooshing] -[screaming] -Beat it, punks! -[gasping] -You don't deserve this. I'm gonna put you back where you belong. Finish him off, Thelma, take your life back! [whooshing] [flesh slashing] [thuds] [exhales sharply] [joyful music] [soft clinking] Adios, Al! [Radman] Oh! That is one hot shot of Patron. That dude is not dead, man, he's... ...he's crispified. I think I speak for everyone here tonight when I say that you did not deserve this. I mean, you're such a beautiful and talented woman and... ...the world turned its back on you. You're not alone anymore, Thelma. Why don't I show you the cherry on top of this bloody sundae? [upbeat music] There is some light that can be shed from the darkness. Oh, yeah? How's that possible? -Gross! -[Thelma laughs] Well, I stood here silenced... ...for years. I watched as they used my restaurant and manipulated the system for their own gain. Lucky for us, paranoid of banks, they kept the vast majority of their wealth... ...here. Here? [Radman] Dang, man. That money is cash? I can get my tooth fixed. Sótano miedoso, bros. So, uh, what kind of wealth are we talking about here? [Radman] Right? I've been broke, dudes. I didn't want to admit it, but the other day, at Super Saver, I stole some trail mix. And, uh, an hour later, man, some dude walked up out of nowhere and punched me right in the face. I'm like, karma. Radman, you were fully schwelping that guy's wife. He was following you all day. -Believe me, that blow to the face... -What? ...had nothing to do with trail mix. Are you serious, dude? Oh, my gosh! I didn't even know she was married! [sighing] Oh! It kind of makes sense now. This is it. Stand back, boys. Let this crazy blonde have some fun. [thuds] [clattering] -Holy golden light! -[Thelma chuckles] [laughs] How much is there? About a million or so. A million dollars won't stretch quite as far as we think these days. -Whoo! -We have to be, like, Bill Ackman smart. No, no, dude. She said there was over a million dollars in gold here. That was in the '30s! That means there's, like, 45.7 million dollars, dude! -[chuckling] -45-- I can get my tooth fixed! I-- we can get all the tooths fixed! Oh, my God! This... ...is... ...real! It's real. It's real! It's real! Look! [laughing] Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

I just wanna make sure you're getting everything as well and you're happy. Where-- where did you get this? Uh, this was left to me by my great-grandfather. I never met him. He died the day before I was born. [sighs] I always knew there was more to life than surfing, bronzing on the beach, and smashing guzzlers. -I did not. -[sighs] Guys, I think we were meant to go through all this to understand what we're meant to do for this world.
