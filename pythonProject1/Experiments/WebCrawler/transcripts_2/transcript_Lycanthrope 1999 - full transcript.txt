[music playing] [breathing] [squeaking] Tim? Tim, is that you? [breathing] [squeaking] [clattering] Tim? Tim, help me lock these doors. He's out there. [screams] [making noises] Couldn't help it, could you? Nuh-uh. [laughter] Bill Parker? A little jungle rot. Nothing serious. - You Jake? - Right. Jake Sutter. He with you? [growl] If you say so. He's good at what he does, and does it all. Hey, man. None of my business. I'm just a coordinator. This one must be a beaut, because nobody's talking back in Washington. I'll brief you before we meet the doc. Stein, wasn't it? That's right. Dr. Ivan Stein. He requested you by name. You must know him. Never heard of him. [music playing] SONG: Friends say they see you walking in the street. You talk to-- Nice cold beer sure does hit the spot. That it does, Jake. So who's you piss off to get stuck out here? It's not so bad. You know, I've been doing your country's dirty work-- Our country's dirty work, Bill. Right. Our country's dirty work for 10 years. I hear I'm one of the best special agents around-- Yeah, I think you started that tumor. Yeah, and I can't find out what's going on. Excuse me. You said you're going to brief us. Brief us. I was told to bring you in to meet Dr. Stein. He seemed to know you. You sure you haven't heard of him? I wouldn't know him if I fell on him. What's his specialty. The human mind. [laughter] A shrink? Behavior specialist. He's here studying the sun's radiation effects on the humans. Out here? Especially out here. There's no humans here, Jake. Hate to be the bearer of bad news, boys, but we have a serious ozone problem. No shit. But why us? There's a lab outpost in the jungle, a place where they run tests and stuff. About a week ago, we lost contact. Terroristas? You tell me when you get back. Oh, I get it. We go in there. We deal with it. You smuggle us out, right? Quick and quiet. You were never here. We never had a problem. Where's Stein come in? It's his operation. Why wasn't he there? Honeymoon. His aid It was supposed to pick him up at the airport, but he never showed. Where's the drop zone? Drop zone? That's good. Yeah, you're new here. This is the Amazon. You don't fly in. You don't fall in. You walk in. Walk? As in on foot? Only takes a day. Well, that's goddamn inconvenient, Jake. You'll get used to it. If not for my rosary and my beer, I probably couldn't survive out here. Speaking of which-- You've got it, Bill. Rosary? Hello. Hi, honey. Bring these boys a couple of cold ones. Sure thing. Good kid. Not bad. I'm glad you like her. She'll be the one who guides you in. Things are brightening up already. She got a sister? [howls] Dr. Stein? Good morning, gentlemen. Please, sit down. Well, my job's done. - Bill-- - Jake. Good luck. Thanks. I have a special goodbye planned for Rosary. - Uh-huh. - Lee. You must be Mr. Parker. Do I know you, doctor? No. Because Jake was telling me you requested me by name. You have quite a reputation and come highly recommended. I've been convinced that you are one of the best men for the job. Yeah, what job is that? DR. STEIN: Escorting my wife and me back to our outpost in the Amazon, and finding out what happened to my scientific team. What makes you think something happened to them? They haven't been heard from in over a week. And frankly there are quite a few theories as to what has happened. It's probably a gorilla attack. There are many mysteries in the Amazon, Mr. Parker. People from all over the world explore the region. Some of them cite findings of things that have never been seen before by man-- insects, plants. Some of them even live to tell about it. Well, I don't think plants and bugs are to blame for the loss of contact with your team. And I don't think gorillas are the answer either. Well, what do you think? My wife told me that you are impatient. Among other things. Sheila? How are you, Bill? You two know each other. In a previous life, I'm afraid. I'm sorry, Bill, but we need you. Oh, this is just great. If the Lone Ranger was here, the reunion would be complete. He's here. Cody's here? I had to ask him in case you refused. Why would I refuse? I didn't know it was you. I'm afraid it was my fault. Your fault? What did you do? Steal her from Cody after she left me for him? [violin] - Shut up, Lee. - Hey, man. This is getting good, man. BILL PARKER: Please? Well, that's no way to make friends. DR. STEIN: My research team and I have been doing a great deal of study on the effects of the destruction of the ozone layer. There are many individuals and countries that would do anything to get their hands on this information. When I mentioned my concerns to my wife, she told me that you were one of the best men for the investigation. And if you wouldn't take the job, then Cody was our other option. Where is he? DR. STEIN: In the hall. SHEILA STEIN: We had to make a decision fast. I thought you wouldn't show if you knew I was involved. And Mr. Carlson resides in the area. SHEILA STEIN: Unlike you, Cody's kept in touch. We need you. We've got to find out what happened at the lab and hopefully find our data intact. And help any-- well, any survivors. So as far as the government is concerned, this little problem you're having here doesn't even exist, right? - That sounds about right. You're escorting a team of medical experts. How's Cody fit in? I've heard Mr. Carlson is an excellent shot. Yeah. You're damn straight. I just about found out firsthand because of her. Understanding are ever. No wonder she left you. Fuck you. That's no way to talk to an old friend, Bill. You ain't heard nothing yet. You need my help. Oh yeah? You could be up against 30 guns or more. BILL PARKER: I'm not impressed by numbers. I am. CODY: I might have been a lousy friend, but I was always an excellent partner, right? The Lone Ranger and Tonto, remember? Yeah. I remember kemosabe running off with my girl. That was personal. This is business. Now when do you want to leave? Ah, hell. We leave in the morning. Does that thing help you figure out the effects of the black ozone? Well as you know, the ozone is a layer of gas that protects us from the harmful rays of the sun. I'm funded to find a link with this ozone problem to a deadly skin disease known as lupus erythematosus chronic discord. It's a disease of unknown origin that's brought on by excessive exposure to the sun. You means skin cancer? Something like that, although more complicated. Tests show that next to Antarctica, this is the location of the largest of the ozone holes. The weather readings indicate that within a year, the Amazon jungle will become a desert, uninhabitable during the daylight hours. Sounds like you're describing the end of the world, doctor. That's precisely what I'm describing. My colleagues and I have compiled several hundred pages of extensive data backing up our theory. We need that data. It's too late to start over. Why? Yesterday was 118 degrees. Water boils at 212. Every day it gets worse. [music playing] SONG: Don't look at the sky. It'll only set your mind in motion, at a speed far greater than an ocean. You question. You question. Through a looking glass I-- I notice you, almost as if you seeped into the cold, pouring rain. No one is to blame for the dilemma. For the dilemma. For the dilemma. Don't look at the sky. It'll only set your mind in motion, at a speed far greater than an ocean. You question. You question. Don't you question? Don't you question? Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Everything all right, doctor? Dr. Stein? It's a lot than where we left. Sorry about the way I got you involved. I got to admit, I was a little surprised. I thought I'd never see you again. That's why I couldn't tell you. I really wanted you to come. Not just for the project, either. I wanted to see you again. Better watch it. You're a married woman. Don't want to upset Ivan. Why Cody? You really don't want to get into that, now do you? I'm tough. I can take it. Why him? Convenience. Convenience? I don't know. He was just there. He never pressured me or talked about settling down. He wanted me to have my career, too. It was a choice I had to make. You made the wrong one. SHEILA STEIN: Yeah? Well, maybe I did. That won't change things now. You saying you didn't love me? That's not the point. It's my career I want, and I won't give that up for anything-- not money or security or-- or even love. But that's all behind us. So how long did it last? Three months. You know our Cody. Hi ho, Silver. Away. So now you just married into your career? Ivan's different from both of you. I wanted to marry you. I know. That's why I left. Don't you see? If I'd stayed, you could convince me of anything-- even to settle down and raise a family. I just couldn't. I had to cut it off before your dreams became my realities. So here we are-- you, me, Cody, and Ivan. God hates me. It's hot. Yeah, but you know, this is no humidity. No, but I noticed little animals exploding all around us. You ready? Funny. Yeah, I'm ready. Ha! Ha! [clattering] It's clear. What a stink. It's through here. This place is too well hidden to have been hit. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Is that all that's on your mind? You know, now that you mention it, Cody, there's a few things I'd like to clear up. Like? Like I thought we were friends. What are you doing going out with Sheila? I'd like to think we still are friends. How long have you two-- We weren't. Just came as a big a surprise to me as it did to you. Just something that happened. Just seemed like a good idea. Let's drop it. Yeah, sure. Besides, we're both out of the picture now. Whoa. Lee, I want that ventilation system going ASAP. No problem. Man. What the fuck died in here? Cody, come with me. Hey, shouldn't we wait for Bill or Cody? They're looking for intruders. This is my office, and I'd like to make sure our data's still intact. Don't suppose either of you has a nail file? How about this? That should do the trick. Radio room. I was just stepping real close, man. BILL PARKER: Whoever did this meant business. Damn. - No sound effect, huh? - Yeah. "Taps." I want you to find that power right now. I don't want to leave the others alone. [beeping] I got it. Come on, man. We'll get Bill and Cody and have them secure the room first. What are you afraid of? They're within shouting distance. If my mother were alive, she'd tell you that if I didn't become a doctor, I would have been a cat burglar. See? Your heroes aren't the only ones capable of breaking and entering. Follow me. [beeping] I can fix this. Good. Cody, let's get this place secure. I always hated working in the dark. Well, it doesn't scare me, kiddies. [laughter] Go easy on him, Lee. Don't go away mad. Here, I got them. Oh, Dr. Stein? What is it? [screams] Sheila. Let's go, quick. Looks like he locked himself in and committed suicide. Yeah, well, look-- there's a hammer and nails. Some wood. Ah. Ah, Sheila, when was the last time you performed an autopsy? Why? These ulcerations on the face-- It was obviously a suicide, Ivan. I'm aware of that, but why is what I'd like to find out. You all right? See? Didn't I tell you your heroes were within shouting distance? Who's he? His name is-- was-- Dr. Springer. Cody, give me a hand. Let's cut him down. I don't suppose you found any survivors? Who the hell did you have working here? Jack the Ripper? What do you mean? Well, I mean, you had eight people manning this laboratory and besides this poor son of a bitch, all we've got is a radio room full of blood. Where the hell is everybody? Well, it sure doesn't look like a terrorist attack. No, it doesn't. The smell around here, I'd say he's been dead a week. When did you say your last contact? Oh, let's see. About nine days ago now. I'd like an autopsy on this man, Mr. Parker, if that's all right with you. I'll tell you what, doc-- this medical bullshit, that's your problem. I'm just here to keep you safe and get you back alive. Everybody all right? Yeah. Hey, good job on the lights. How about some AC? Well, don't beat me. I work cheap. Lee, get the AC working. [air conditioner starts] - You feel that? You feel that? Good old American know-how. Who da man? I'll check the files. Who's he? Dr. Springer. He needs a serious-ass make-over. Yeah. Let's put him on the table. Lee. Have to beat the bongo. If my memory is correct, the doctor seems to have all the symptoms of lupus. Are you sure? Now he's badly decomposed, but look at the ulcerations here and here. I know I've seen this before. We'll have to take these tissue samples to the lab to really know for sure. Is this shit contagious? No, Lee. This shit is caused by overexposure to the sun. This place seems secure enough. If worst came to worst, we could make a last stand here. I'm afraid that's what Dr. Springer thought as well, Mr. Carlson. Lee, is our generator OK? Actually, this place runs on solar power, and some of the main services have been trashed. - Trashed? - Yes, ma'am. Torn to shreds. But we got a gas gennie in the back and 10 gallons of Esso's finest. So we're all right. Well, that ought to go in an emergency. Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You expecting an emergency? Hey, I'm just making this up as I go along. I don't want to use any more energy than is absolutely necessary. So let's secure the lights we're not using. We'll look for survivors after we've had some rest. We hadn't planned on resting. Bill, I think we'd really like to get to work on this autopsy. Lee, Rosary, let's go and secure a perimeter. All right. See you, doc. What are you so jumpy about? Look at that blood. Until we can figure out what happened here, we're going to break in shifts. This seems to be the only sector within lights, so I think we'll call this home. Sounds good to me. Cody, you and Rosary see if you can find some blankets. Lee's got the AC working so good I'm going to freeze to death. Bitch, bitch, bitch. You gonna take the first watch, Bill? Yeah, I am. Listen, we'll each pull two hours. We'll get some rest that way, and then in the morning, we can start looking for survivors. This is scary shit, man. I hate this place, man. I had this fucking place. [squeaking] Shit. Lee will have to take care of it in the morning. What a mess. Cody, shine the light over there. CODY: I don't like it. Who could have done this? CODY: Damned if I know. Just grab a few blankets. We're not going to find any survivors here. Ready when you are. My, you look beautiful when you're scrubbed. Everything all right? As well as can be expected. I brought you a present. How thoughtful. Well, it's the only color I could find. And sheets too. Why, William. You shouldn't have. Well, I didn't think you'd want to make too much of a mess, so maybe those will help. Parker, if you don't mind, we've got a lot of work to do. Sorry. Thanks, Bill. Sure. Crazy fool still loves you. Well, he can't be that crazy. You love me, too. I suppose Cody still has feelings-- Quite possible. Right now, we've got work to do. [squeaking] Who's there? Lee, is that you. Damn it. [breathing] [breathing] LEE: Hold it. Who goes there? I am the master of these halls. You may not pass. Shh. I heard something. What? So did I. Your licking hair. Go ahead. And you keep cool. We just met. BILL PARKER: Rosary, Lee, where are you? Oh, we better answer him. Whatever was down here, it ain't down here no more. We're down here. I'm going to go look around. There might be some scared survivors. All right, all right. Look, be careful. I hate this place. I know. I'll be all right. Here goes nothing. Captain. What's going on? [screams] Get Cody. - No, I'm going with you, man. - No, you're not, man. Get Cody quick. Check. You all right? Now we've found two. What did this? It wasn't lupus. Lee, I want the whole place lit. Forget saving power. LEE: Yes, sir. - The whole place, lit now. - All right. All right. - Go. LEE: Come on, come on. Give me the flashlight, Bill. Forget it, Cody. Nobody's going in any sector that isn't lit. [howling] So how do you know a beast killed him? BILL PARKER: Something killed him. And it wasn't terrorists or gorillas or some goddamned sickness. What do you think did it? I don't know, but you can bet your ass everybody in this place didn't commit suicide. DR. STEIN: Can you bring the body back up here? There's no reason to get hysterical. There's got to be a logical explanation. We've just not yet found it. As soon as Lee gets this place lit, we're going to find it. Red, red, yellow, yellow, brown, brown. Boop. Computer. Betas. Beep. Warp core breach contained. Ah, cool. Let's just see. Prepare for power. Stand by. Engage. [breathing] Ha! Damn, I'm good. I do all this good. I got this shit going on. I'm going to shoot you if I can get that gun. All right, hand-to-hand then. Come on, you Chewbacca motherfucker. Come on. What's that? Christ, that's Lee. Lock this door. Don't open it till we get back. No, thank you. I'll leave the killing to the lover-boys. I'll take it. Hey, look-- I lived with Bill and Cody, and believe me, I can use this thing better than both of them. You don't want to see him. It's-- Oh, man. You bastard! Come out! Where the fuck are you? Save your strength. What are we up against, man? Wish I knew. You still think we're getting hysterical? I think we could stand to be a little more rational. Rational? This thing just tore my partner to bits. This same thing wiped out your entire medical team. Now excuse me, doctor, if I seem like I'm a little overly concerned. The autopsy turn up anything? The body does indeed show symptoms of advanced lupus, mask of the wolf. What the fuck is that? Apparently Dr. Springer spent too much time in the sun. People don't kill themselves over a fucking sun burn. DR. STEIN: Not unless they fear dying anyway. With that thing out there, I'm surprised he wasn't scared of it. I meant a slow death, where his flesh would be slowly eaten away by the sun's rays. That would be enough to force anyone to take his own life. The final step of sanity is to become insane. Look, we've gotten the documents we need for the ozone project. I say we get the hell out of here. In the jungle at night? Are you nuts? Look, I need a few hours. A few hours? We won't last a few minutes if that thing decides he wants inside. I need time, till sunrise. By then, we'll know what happened to our colleagues. I can tell you what happened. They were ripped to shreds. Mr. Parker, I need you to control your emotions. Your orders were to protect us and find out what happened here. And that's precisely what I'm going to do. What do you suggest, doctor? First, I think we should bring Lee's body back up here. I think another autopsy is in order. I don't want you dissecting Lee like some animals. Mr. Parker, please. If I'm going to find out some answers, I'm going to have to do this my way. By examining his wounds, we'll be able to find out what type of instrument was used to kill him. Rosary, I'm going to need your help with Lee. Sure thing. If you wish, you can dispose of Dr. Springer. You mean bury the man. DR. STEIN: Whatever. Cody-- Got it. He was right here. Are you sure he was dead? Yeah. Yeah, he was torn to bits. Bill, look at this. Leads right through that door. Maybe we should seal it in. Thought you knew how to use that thing. - I do. - So what are you worried about? Finding something to use it on. Me too. Come on. Let's go. I'm telling you, we get a hammer and we board it up inside. I'd like to know what we're up against. Funny. I'm not that curious. You ready? I'm ready. [screams] [gunshot] You OK? Bill-- Cody! Cody, come up here and secure this door. Come on. We've got to get you to Sheila. Come on. Come on, quick. Cody, get up here. Bill, describe what you saw. I'm not sure. It looked like a man, but he acted like a wild animals. I can only tell you what I saw. What you saw, or what you think you saw? I'm not crazy. Rosary saw it too. Bill, no one's calling you crazy. Everyone OK? Yeah, aside of me being nuts, we're doing fine. Did you manage to get that-- Don't worry, Bill. If he were Houdini, he couldn't get out there. Rosary's babysitting. Good work, Cody. Do we have any wild guesses what this is? Well, it's either a figment of my imagination or some kind of wolf-man. What, a werewolf? Not quite, but close. CODY: I thought werewolves were something created for the movies. There are many werewolf legends and stories found in all parts of the world, some with more validity than others. But as far as I know, there's no such thing as a werewolf. Did you see fangs or hair? I'm not sure. Perhaps Bill's right. What are you thinking, Ivan. Perhaps what you saw is a lycanthrope. A what? Why does that sound familiar? "Lycanthrope-- formerly a man believed to be transformed into a wolf. A werewolf." BILL PARKER: I thought you said there was no such thing. Let her continue. "Now known as the person affected with lycanthropy." BILL PARKER: What? SHEILA STEIN: It says it's an insanity in which the patient supposes himself to be a wolf. I've heard about this back in Germany. It is indeed something to behold-- a plain and simple type of schizophrenia in which one of the multiple personalities is that of an animal, or in this case, a wolf. SHEILA STEIN: Combine this with the effects of being exposed to the sun without ozone protection, and we've got one serious-- CODY: One sick fucker. Not quite the medical term I'd give it, Mr. Carlson, but for now, it will do. BILL PARKER: Look, Ivan, this guy was strong enough that he tore Lee apart and dragged him up a flight of stairs. What you saw was a man who thought himself a wolf, a lycanthrope. Look, I saw this guy's face up close. He growled at us. He snapped at us. He was like a-- A monster? The human mind is indeed something to behold. - Here we are. - What? What you got? Kevin Johnson. He's our man, Bill. Read this. You're not going to like it. Six foot five, 275 pounds. What kind of scientists have you got working for you? This guy was ugly before he became a wolf. He's not a wolf. He's still a man. He just thinks he's a wolf. - Oh, that's terrific. We've got Mr. Universe trapped upstairs and he thinks he's Lon Chaney. Now what? We must bring him back for study. Ivan, he's a human being. He should be taken back for treatment. Yeah, but he's killed. All the more reason. What we are witnessing here is a kind of reverse evolution. We have tranquillizers. We can sedate him. I can't believe you'd make a scientist out of a guy that size. According to his personal file, he's been with the program for two years. Played some college football. Even competed in the Olympic trials as a weight-lifter. He was one ugly bastard. That was the overexposure to the sun. We have no idea of the transformation he's undergoing internally, as well as externally. Why is it I don't feel sorry for him? - A natural fear of the unknown. - Ah, fear. Hell. Your friend's already killed nine people. I'm for doing him in. That's out of the question. He quiet OK. Lets out with a howl from time to time. How's that arm? Oh, itching like crazy. What are you doing? Taking precautions. Silver? The Lone Ranger, remember? Besides, they're supposed to bring you luck. You afraid of werewolves? Nah. [howling] But I'm damned close. So am I. Where'd you find them? An old guy at a village not too far from the base made them for me. Cost me a buck a bullet. Ah, can you get two for me? Sure. It'll cost you $5 a piece. $5? I thought you said it cost you one buck. Supply and demand. If you want, I can show you where the village is. Ha, ha, ha. Very funny. Suit yourself. [banging] Maybe I'll take one. I'll pay you when we get back. One? One is all I'm going to need. You all right? I don't feel too good. How's she doing? SHEILA STEIN: Shock. High blood, highly unusual. Take care of her. SHEILA STEIN: Will do. How can you think such a thing? Not only as my wife, but as a scientist. I was merely suggesting that perhaps it would be in the best interest of the expedition if we left Kevin behind for now and came back for him at a later date with the proper equipment. Absolutely not. He'd starve to death trapped like that, then we'd never be able to study him. We have no idea how much of his human emotions are still intact. But you're forgetting why we were sent here in the first place. We have him contained. You don't know that for sure. I mean, what if he becomes immune to heat and just walks right out of here. We don't have the man power, Ivan. Tranquilize him. Yeah, right. Ivan, he's killed nine people. He will surely try to kill us. Kevin's no longer human. He thinks he's a wolf. A werewolf. A werewolf? I prefer the term lycanthrope. I was bitten by a werewolf. It's all right. It's going to be just fine. But it bit me. Do you know what that means? It's sheila. I'm here. Everything's going to be fine. I promise. He bit me. It's just an old wives tale. Surely you don't really believe that, now do you? It's all right. Just calm down. Look, I've cleansed the wound, so there shouldn't be any infection, all right? I think it might be wise if we gave her a little something to sedate her. Perhaps you're right. It was a werewolf, wasn't it? Don't be absurd. There's really no such thing as-- Yes, you're right. It's a werewolf. And it bit me. And I'm going to turn into something like that? Help me, please. Don't worry, it'll be all right. Ivan, what are you saying? It's no use hiding it from her, Sheila. We've got to tell her the truth, then we can kill the lycanthrope and get her back to the states where we can help her. If we leave him where he is, he'll die anyway. It's the humanitarian thing to do. Either kill him, or let him go. Is there anything you can do? Or am I going to turn like that thing out there? I'm not sure yet. But now I'll show you why I became a scientist. Just lie calm and relax. Go ahead and give her a sedative. I feel myself changing. Of course you do. Now just relax. What are you telling her? She's not changing. What kind of mind game are you playing here anyway? You're trying to control her, aren't you? I'm not doing a thing to her. She's going to do it all to herself. That's the strange thing about science. All I've got to do is observe. She's a simple native. Her mind is weak. It's the power of suggestion. I'm sorry, but I can't let you do this, husband or not. You didn't feel the necessity to bring back the lycanthrope for study, so I'll create one of my own. That's impossible. Not with the human mind. By taking her back, we'll be able to observe her through all the stages of change. And by letting Kevin go free, I'll be able to come back and see how an advanced case of lycanthropy develops. You talk about Kevin and Rosary as if there were some kind of lab experiment. And Rosary's not even lycanthropic. Not yet, but she may well be. She's well on her way to becoming quite insane. This is a side of you I've never seen, Ivan. It's what I do, darling. I study the human mind, and you protect the environment. And our government pays us quite well, if you'll remember. But this is cruel. This is science. Now give her a sedative. I'll take care of the rest. Please help me. No, don't worry. Everything's going to be just fine, I promise. I'll give you something to help you sleep, OK? Is everything all right, Cody? He's been quiet for almost 30 minutes. You're against taking him back, I suppose? It's a risk we don't have to take. If man didn't take risks, where would we be today? No tools. The luxuries. No atom bomb. The world would be a far better place. For you, my friend. You're a survivalist. You like living hand-to-mouth, coming and going as you please, nothing to tie you down, no business to keep up. Just the survival of the fittest. Dr. Stein! Stay where you are, Cody. Stay away from that door. I may not be as good a shot as you or Mr. Parker, but I will hit something vital at this close range. Think of what you're doing. [gunshots] Cody. What happened? Stein. Son of a bitch. [screams] [gunshots] Come in, Mr. Parker. Drop your gun on the floor. Kick it over here. Have a seat. What the hell is going on? He's lost his mind, Bill. Yeah, I know. He just killed Cody. Was he your favorite, my darling? I'd like to say it was either him or me, but I don't think Mr. Carlson would have pulled the trigger. He wasn't half the beast you made him out to be. What did she tell you about me? Oh, you would have shot me dead, Mr. Parker. You've got to stop him, Bill. He's turning Rosary into a lycanthrope. How? It's a mind control thing. Suggestion. As a matter of fact, she's become quite lycanthropic. That's impossible. It hasn't even been three hours yet. It's a form of insanity, my darling. We know very little about it. We must study it. What's he talking about, Sheila? He's convinced her she's been bitten by a werewolf. It's a disease, Mr. Parker. Insanity, remember? We know very little about it. We must study it. She's going to turn into one of those things? She has become one of those things, haven't you, my dear? This has got to be a bad dream. Oh, no. I assure you it's a very good dream, a scientist's dream come true. Well, somewhere along the line, doctor, you've become very side-tracked. I was supposed to come down here and help you find the data that your team compiled about the loss of the ozone. I think you told me that the fate of the world depended on it. Well, I'm convinced. I've seen your lycanthrope, OK? DR. STEIN: But we were also supposed to find out what happened here, and that's precisely what I'm doing. A find like this comes along once in a lifetime. A find? You call a murderous monster a scientific find? I can't explain it to you if you won't have an open mind. Stop! It's my life's work! [screams] [gunshot] Sit down! Too bad. I'd hoped she'd be the one I could take back. Now I'll have to tranquilizer Mr. Johnson and take him back. You'll never be able to take him alive, doctor. He's just going to kill you and come back after us. It's a risk I'll have to take. SHEILA STEIN: You're a murderer. Tie him up. Listen, doctor, you want to capture him, you got to let us help you. Sorry, but that won't work. You've never going to be able to do it alone. There's a definite conflict of interests here. You're witnesses to a murder. I've got to figure out what to do with you two. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. I guess a double dose should do the trick. You're just going to walk up to him and ask him to drop his pants? Let me worry about that. Come here, my dear. What are you going to do? You didn't think I was going to tie him up and leave you loose, did you? Even if you are right and I am mad, I'm not stupid. Well, I wouldn't call going after that thing with a syringe exactly bright. Someday, you'll understand. Psst. The knife. What? Rosary's knife. [squeaking] [squeaking] Wait! I'm not going to hurt you. Wait, Kevin. Think of it-- you're going to be a great discovery. Imagine, a man who thinks himself a wolf. Wait, wait! Take your papers. Got them. Come on. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm not going to let anyone hurt you. I'm just going to put you to sleep for a little while, take you home. [screaming] [screams] You'll hit Ivan. I don't care. [gunshots] You hit him. If it bleeds, I can kill it. [screams] [gunshots] [howls] [gunshot] Silver bullets, my ass. Well, Rosary, what do you say we blow this pop stand? [breathing] [monkey squealing] [heartbeat] [animal noises] [screams] - Hey, hey, hey. Relax. It's just a dream. Wow. It seemed so real. Yeah, well the bad ones generally do. Is this normal? Normal? For who? Look, you've been through a lot. I'll have the nurse stop in and give you a sedative. It'll help you sleep. - Oh, no. I don't want to sleep. The dream. Yeah. Jake said he could set you up with some counseling in Rio. Jake? You spoke to Jake? Yeah. You know, if I didn't know better, I'd say he was checking up on you. He told me the whole story. You know, you are one tough little girl. He wants to take you home. This came for you. What is it? It's a card. Open it and see. It's from Jake. No! What is it? A silver bullet? A friend of mine gave me this. Doctor, when can I go home? Well, as a matter of fact, I told Jake he could come pick you up tomorrow. Tomorrow? So soon? Well, aside from loss of blood, some dehydration and fatigue-- and I took a piece of lead out of your side about the size of a quarter. There's nothing I can do for you now. There's no reason why you can't go home and recuperate. You could recuperate on a beach in Rio. Let me take a look. Now breath. One more time. Heart seems to be working. Well, how does it look? On you, my darling, anything would look good. You are too kind. Look, I have some other rounds to make. I'll be back to check on you later. I'll have the nurse come in and give you that sedative. Try to get some rest. I'll try. But I keep on having this dream I'm turning into a wolf. It's all right. The sedative will work. I promise. I don't know, doctor. Rosary, there's no such thing as a werewolf. You were bitten by a man, a human-- not a werewolf, but a human, OK? Just keep telling yourself, no such thing as werewolves. Yeah. Sure. Whatever you say. Whatever you say. Sally? Yes, doctor? You need to check the girl's vitals. And a sedative, something strong, something to help her sleep. OK. Poor thing. She's been through a lot, hasn't she? Yeah, but I'm going to let her go tomorrow. Do you think that's a wise decision? Doesn't matter. There's nothing more we can do for her here. All right. Well, I'll take care of it. [screams] You know, I've been doing your country's dirty work-- Our country's dirty work. Right, our country's dirty work for the last 10 years. I hear I'm one of the best special agents around. Yeah-- I think you started that move. Yeah, I can't find out what's going on. - Excuse me. - Why are we here-- DIRECTOR: That's got it. Do it again. Why? That was fucking great. Understanding as ever. No wonder she left you. Fuck you. That's no way to talk an old friend Bill. You ate her-- You need my help. DIRECTOR: Cut. You didn't think I was going to tie him up and leave you loose, did you? Even if you are right and I am mad, I'm not stupid. Well, I wouldn't call going after that thing with a syringe exactly right. Someday, you'll understand. Psst, the knife. I think we're-- [laughter] You have quite a reputation and come highly recommended. I've been convinced that you are one of the best men for the job. Yeah, what job is that? Escorting my wife and me back to our-- shit. DIRECTOR: Cut. Take two. Escorting me and my wife-- oh, shit. DIRECTOR: Cut. That line. Escorting my wife and me back to our outpost in the Amazon and finding out what happened to my scientific team. Uh, excuse me, doctor. What makes you think? [babble] DIRECTOR: 68, take four. You think you hear something. Who's there? Lee, is that you? DIRECTOR: You're sure you do. BILL PARKER: Somewhere along the line you got side-tracked, doctor. I was supposed to help you find and return data compiled by your associates to repair the ozone. I believe the fate of the world depended on it. Now that I've seen your lycanthrope, I'm convinced. DR. STEIN: But we were also supposed to find out what happened. DIRECTOR: Cut. [laughter] 48, take two. Who's he? Dr. Springer. Got a real pretty mouth on him, doesn't he? He squealed like a pig. Look at him now. [laughter] Who's he? Dr. Springer. Fucking Romulans. Excuse me? DIRECTOR: Cut. [laughter] 23L, take four. Action. JAKE: A nice cold beer sure does hit the spot. That is does, Jake. [airplane] DIRECTOR: Cut. Speed. Mark. [MUSIC - PITCH BLUE JAM, "TAKE A REST"] SONG: Mississippi delta. Hot day, crying child. Mother, no father. Yeah, the river runs wild. No idea. And a thoughtless brow. Like the people of the daily. Be the youth too wild. You got to take a rest now. Take it easy. Take a rest now, baby. Take it easy. Man and a boy are staring at the edge of the pond. One sees days to go while one sees days long gone. Yeah. Restless pond, and a reminiscing smile. The man and a boy, they're gonna take a little rest for a while. Take it easy, baby. Take a rest now. Take it easy. Take a rest now, baby. Take it easy. You got to-- got to take a rest now, baby. Want to take it easy now. You got to take a rest now. Take it easy.
