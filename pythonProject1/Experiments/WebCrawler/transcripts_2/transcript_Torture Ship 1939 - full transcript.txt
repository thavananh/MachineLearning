foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- (theatrical theme music) - You guys want to be tortured like rats? Well, it's your turn. - Brothers, not me. - I won't stand for it. - He can't get away with it. - Who's he think he is? - Well, what are we gonna do? - Take over this boat. - But the captain, the crew, they're dutch boys. - With guns in their ribs, they're our boys. - Personally, I won't need any weapons. - I got it. The doc's got some knives in his operating room. - Uh, knives! What we need is guns. And we're gonna get them. Doc's got guns in his cabin. So has the maid. We'll wait until everybody's asleep. Take the doc's quarters first. There'll be only three in there, it'll be a cinch. - Gonna take them bye-bye? - What do you think? - Shall I give the alarm? - No, we'll handle it. - Once we get that far, the rest will be a push-over. (door knocking) - Who is it? - Dr. Stander. - Hi, doc. - Good evening gentlemen. - Hiya, doc. - Just talking about you. - Yes, I heard you. - Oh, when I planned this voyage, I took every necessary precaution. - Predictable, huh? - Correct. You men are acting very foolishly. - Why? Because we aren't going to let you make better men out of us? - You have no choice in the matter. - Doc, you're coming here, just solved our problems. - Oh yeah! We're going to make a better man out of you, doctor! - I got it. The doc's going to get the guns. If he don't, we'll operate. (laughs) - Yeah, my life means nothing, gentlemen, until I can finish my work and that I intend to do. (laughs loudly) - Listen to the guy! (thud sounds) Go do it, go do it brothers! (thud sounds) - Nice work boys. What shall we do with them? - I think they've learned a lesson. You might untie me. Better lock them up. That won't do any good. - You sir, we ain't through yet. - You're wrong Ritter. You are through. Uh, Ezra, I'd like to see you in my office for an examination. - Don't touch me! - Oh, come now. There's nothing to be frightened about. Come on! - I'm not going to that, am I? - There's nothing to be frightened about. - I'm not going with them. No, I'm not going with them. Don't let 'em. - Goodnight, gentlemen. I wish you a good night's rest. And please remember that wherever you are on the ship, Your whereabouts are known. (bell rings) - What did you do with those policies? - I tell you, I didn't have them. - They were in the office when the police came in, you were the only one there. - I didn't take them. - I should've known better than to hire a stupid little fool for a secretary. You gave them to the police. - I tell you, I didn't. - Sit there. - You thought you'd save your own neck by turning over the evidence, didn't you? (thud sounds) Give me that. (thud sounds) - Hey, what's going on in here? Take it... Wait a minute, take it easy. - You keep out of it. - Would you calm down please? Take it easy. What's going on in here. Tell me, were you mixed up with Mary and the poison ring? - I swear, I didn't know she was poisoning people to collect their insurance. - You work for her. - Yes, a secretary. I believed she was in a legitimate insurance business. Oh, it's all so terrible. You must believe me. You do, don't you? - Your nephew's here to see you, says it's very important. - Dirk, prepare another inadine solution. - Yes, doctor. - You and Paul stay with the patient. Don't leave him for a moment. - Anything else, doctor? - Conditions not at all favorable. Not the reaction I'd hoped for. Remember, don't leave him. Not a second. - Well Bob, what's on your mind. - It's about the girl, Joan. - Yes, I noticed that you were attracted to her. - She's in danger. - Hmm. Aren't you big and strong enough to protect her. - This is serious. Mary tried to kill her. - Come, sit down. Tell me all about it. - Oh, there's not much to tell. Mary believes that Joan turned over to the police some incriminating papers. The point is Joan had nothing to do with that poison ring. She's innocent. - You mean she told you she was innocent? - I know she is. - Yes, I can understand you're believing it. Especially when the subject is young and beautiful. - You must have a talk with her. - I have talked with her and was married too. But if it will make you feel any better, I'll talk with them again. Where are they? - Well, Joan's on deck. Mary is in her state room, I guess. - Let's see Mary first. (doors opens) (door knocking) - Come in. If you're here about that little double-crosser, you can save your breath. - Was Joan involved with you in the poison ring? - She helped break down with me, didn't she? Before the trial. - That wouldn't mean that she's guilty. - Well I ought to know, she was my partner, helped me plan the whole thing. Don't let that little doll face fool you. - I tell you, she's not a criminal. - We'll prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt by my treatments. - Treatments, not on Joan. - Bring me all the tests I've made. The case histories, my notes. Hurry. - Yes, sergeant. - Now lock yourself in and don't open the door for anyone. I'll bring your food. - This is your statement. - Yes. - But I don't- - Now, do as I say, Joan. Something's happened, I can't tell you now. Goodnight and don't worry. (door closes and locks) (door opens) - Hi mate. - Hello, how are you? - Which way we're heading? - Well, it looks to me like a cruise to nowhere. - Yeah, I thought the same thing. You've been following the sea long? - Oh, since I was about 14. - It's a pretty long time. (laughs) A man of your age should return. - That's the dream of every seafaring man. A home and a garden. I got a place all picked out. - Maybe I could make that possible. Are you interested? - Well, maybe. - I came aboard with a pretty big stake. 10,000 dollars is yours if you help us. - Oh no, no, I don't want- - Calm down, come on. - Let me go. Wait a minute, let me go. You can't do that to me. - I think we can. - Let me go. No, wait, let me go. - There goes another one. Probably kill him like they did Elvin. - Maybe, I'll be next. - Well, how can I help you? - Take over this boat. - Do you know how to swim, Ritter? - Yeah, a little. Why? - Well you're do for a good long one if you don't get out of here quick. - Okay. (door knocking) No, you can't come in. You ain't gonna get me like you got Ezra. You're not going to get me. - He don't want you. Open the door. This is Ole. (door opens) (indistinct) - Come to clean up. Shaving, huh? - Yeah, yeah. - You said you would do me a favor sometime. How would you like to give me a shave? - Give you a shave? - Yeah, sure. (laughs) - I'd be tickled to death to give you a shave. - Well thank you there. - Sit down. - It's on look for pleasure. - Yeah, fix it. - Yeah, sure, I'll do it. (Ole humming) If you don't mind, I would like a close shave. - Yeah, don't worry. It's going to be plenty close. (laughs) - Ah, you are a good fellow (indistinct) Someday, Ezkel do you a favor. Bet your life (indistinct) (laughs) Ain't never seen so many funny people as we got on this water. - Yeah. - Yeah and you are the funniest. (laughs loudly) - Is that so? - Ah yeah. (laughs) - Oh, wait a minute. Take a look and see what my public thinks about me. - Yeah, sure. (indistinct) Oh, there it is. Well, that's a huge photograph of you, Mr. Harry. - Yeah, but that don't do me no justice. - What does it say? - Read it. - Yeah. Harry, the carver. Gets fifth victim. (stutters) (crockeries shattering) - Better make them tight. He'll sleep for several hours. (door knocking) - Who is it? - It's Bob. (door opening) Are you all right? - Well, it's a little confining. - Well, everyone's turned in. Would you like to take a walk around there? - Oh, I'd love it. (door closes) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (water splashes) (dramatic music) - Oh. (thud sounds) (Joan screams) - Bob! (thud sounds) - Take him down. Take him to the ward. - Yes. - You'll be all right. - That man, he- - Yes, he was stronger than I thought. Come, you must get hold of yourself. Dirk, Paul, take him to the ward. Good. Very good. The perfect reaction. - I'd rather face a wild bull the next time. (laughs) - We're progressing. Did you give him a pill? - Yes, doctor. - Sleep's all he needs. He won't have any after effects. Is the girl in my study? - Yes, she is. - She'll recover. Nervous shock. She became hysterical. - She's comfortable now. - One thing more, Paul, have you been around the ship? - Yes, sir. Briggs and myself. They're all sleeping. - Good. - Oh, we can't go on with our experiments. It's no use. - Doctor, I thought that- - I'll qualify that. - To one, I must change my procedure. - How's that doctor? - As you know, I have obtained in this synthetically, the active ingredients of the endocrine glands governing criminality. Synthetically, that's just the trouble. Krantz proved it. I've been trying to duplicate nature's work in the test tube. It just can't be done. - There must be some answer to it, doctor. - There is. I must let nature do this work for me in the body of a normal person, like you (bang) or Paul. - That's, that's dangerous, isn't it doctor? - It's a chance one must take. Wait. (door closes) - He's not going to put that stuff in me. - Nor me. (door opens) - Dirk and Paul, come here. Did you hear what I said? Hurry! Take him in there. I know what you're thinking. Bob is my nephew. I've sacrificed everything to prove my theory. Bob is free from criminal taint. The perfect subject. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Bob, no! No! - Doctor! Doctor, what is it? What happened? - You all right, doctor? - Bob is loose. He's take Joan, hurry! (door knocking) - Bob, open up. (door knocking) Open up, Bob, you hear me? Bob, open the door. (door knocking) - Get an ax. - Well, what are you doing, you crook? I thought your racket was insurance. - Go away, I'm looking for my gun. (thud sounds) (glass shattering) I got it. - Got what? - Here, take this. - Me with a gun? (smirks) Take a look. - I'll take that gun. Where'd you get it? - In the drawer. - Hmm, boy do I need this. Hey, there's something funny going on tonight. - Uh, hello comrades. - Fine, fine. The adrenal simulation is worn off. Take him back to the ward. - They're all out there armed. There'll be another search. We've got to get back to save (indistinct) What do we do with- Hey, hide these. You know, make out like you're still sick. Get me? - Yeah, I got it. - It was you who made a mess like this? - My dear, there are some things you can never understand. - You changed a fine boy, your own nephew into a brute like the rest of you. - There there. Don't carry on like this. Bob will be all right. You mustn't fall in love with him. I'm trying to save you that heartache. - Well, I do love him and you can't stop me. (water splashing) - We've searched all cabins, sir. - We must find those guns? - Guess where I found these? - In Harry's cabin? - No, he hid them in a galley with a silverware. - Did you searched our quarters? The laboratory, the ward? - No, sir. I didn't think it was necessary. - I want every place on the yacht searched. We must find those guns and keep them all locked up. - Yes, sir. - Come on. - Hi, you boop. You are not getting half what is coming to you. Soaking all them people. Aye, yours wish you wasn't sick. (indistinct) - Certainly, no guns around here. - Where haven't have we looked? - The ward, the operating room, doctor's state room, mine and Paul's. - We'll take the ward first. Search that bed. - Did you gentlemen lose something? - Someone stole two guns. Have you seen them? - I would just as soon touch a rattlesnake as I would a gun. - Not here. - Well, we'll search the other room. - You should do away with me, have it over with. - You're taking this much too seriously, Bob. The worst is over. - I suppose you killed Ezra on purpose. I suppose you made madmen of Krantz and me just to amuse yourself. Ritter was right. We're a bunch of guinea pigs. You're not gonna touch me again. (dramatic music) (door knocking) - You have Bob in here. - Go away, my dear. I'm very busy. - But I know you have him in here. Haven't you tortured him enough? Open the door. Let me in, please. (door knocking) Please. (orchestra music) - Is there something wrong, Ms. Joan. - Ole, have you a gun? - Have I got a gun? Everybody's asking me the same thing. Have I got a gun? - Well have you? - If a gun was even two feet in front of me, I would run like Hail Columbia. (orchestra music) I think everybody is getting crazy on this water. And do you know about that Harry fella, Ms. Joan? I thought he was a good fella but one day, he said he would give me a shave. And they let him. You know who that fella is? That fella... Everybody is crazy. (dramatic music) (Joan screams) - Hold it. - Very clever. - Release. Don't come any closer. - We found the guns. My dear, may I ask where you got hold of Mary's revolver? - Release Bob, doctor. - Take her to my study. - Let me go, let me go. You can't do this! Let me go! - Hey Bob, I'm inclined to think that girl's in love with you. Not interested? With this treatment, you'll find it a bit difficult to coordinate thought and action. You probably won't be able to recognize people for some time. - Get in there. - I'm a citizen. I stand by the constitution, you can't treat me like that. I demand my Bill of Rights. - Should you guys tell us why that gun is here then you'll stay locked up. - This is too much. Open the door. You wait. - What were your parents' ages when you were born? - Oh, what's this all about? - I'm preparing your case history, my dear, before we- - Before you kill me? - No. - Yes, Briggs. - We've gone through every state room again, sir. The men are raising quite a fuss. - And they'll stay locked up until that gun is found. They'll have no food. - It is all right, doctor if the captain be walking around? - Yes, he's all right. - Is that all, sir? - Yes. See that your men are armed, we must be prepared for any emergency. - Yes, sir. - Now, my dear, should we continue? - You're going through with this. - Of course. - Doctor. - The young lady is a little nervous. She's quite normal. - That's why I sent for you, doctor. - A good indication. Very fine. These two girls, Mary and Joan will prove or disprove my theory. If it fails... - We mustn't think of that doctor. - We must think of everything. If this test fails us, we're lost. - I don't understand. - We'd have to turn back. Keep the constant fluxion. Dirk. - You go with Paul, I'll call you. - Yes, doctor. - Well, my dear, we're almost ready for you. There, there. - Bob. - Bob. Bob, don't you recognize me? - Bob. Bob, darling, don't you know me? Oh, what have you done to him? - There's no cause for alarm. He'll recover. - Bob. Bob, dear. - He won't recognize people for some time. - How could you? Your own nephew. - Dirk. (door tapping) (water splashes) - This is no place for you, sir. Perhaps if you went below for a little while, maybe took a little rest. (door knocking) - I'll go. - Yes? It's Bob, I must see you. I feel so... - I can't be disturbed, Bob. Go lay down. You'll be all right. - Something- Something's happened to me. I must see you. - Do think he's giving her too heavy a solution? - I must see you for a moment, now. I must, I tell you. - I'll see you in an hour. - Please. Please. - Hey, you're all just a bunch of criminals and I just don't know if I can do it. And I also want you to know that Ole is a brave, man, by Django? Just put up your hands. - Django, where'd you get this? - Yeah, captain- - Nevermind that. Have you got a pass key to all the segunes? - Yeah, sure. - Well, give it to me, quick. - Yeah, but Cap- - Give it to me. - Yeah, sure. - Hurry up there. Come on, give it to me, will you? And you better get under a cover because there's going to be trouble. - Yeah, (indistinct) (dramatic music) - Come on, Ritter. - Oh no. No, sir. You're not going to give me another shot. - Come on. I'm setting you free. - What? - Help me take over the ship. - You (indistinct) - Certainly I am. - All right, you bought yourself a man their in the operating room armed. We gotta get guns from Briggs, and the other sailors first. - It's okay by me. - One provision. No harm to the doctor. I land Joan and the others, wherever you're say. - Sure, sure. Give me that gun. - No, I'll take care of it. - Now, separate fellas. Try to get up there without being seen. - And what if they start shooting? What are we going to do? - That's your tough luck. - Watch out down there! (gun fires) (water splashes) (dramatic music) (thud sounds) (gun fires) - Hold it, man. Hold it, you hear me? We're taking over the boat, Briggs. As long as you obey orders you're safe. You understand? Come here. Call the doctor. Tell him, "The men are loose. We need your help. Quick." - Be ready. - Dirk. (line buzzes) Yes? - Doctor, the men are loose. I need your help. - Can't you hold them? - I need your help! - Hello? (line clicks) Hello? All right let's go. Jesse, you stay here. Dirk, Paul, the men are loose. Get your guns. Now remember, no shooting. - You know me, Cap. - Drop those guns. (gun fires) - Faster. That's all right, let him go. We'll handle them later. Maybe do a little operating, ourselves. - That's swell, doctor. Be fun. - Joan. Oh, Joan, it's all right. - Bob. - It's all right. It's all right, darling. - Hey, I guess you're glad you listened to me, huh? - No, sir. You know, I think I haven't gonna like this trip. - Hey, slave. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Yes, Mr. Hattie? (indistinct) - Got you. - Go get me some of that sweety shit... - Herring, yes, sir. Right away, sir. - How about the names? - Mary's done for. The other. You boys can forget about. Any objections? Okay, Ritter. You know me. (chuckles) - Men, now that you've had your little red pass, I must tell you is something of serious importance. That last injection I gave each of you was only temporary. Unless you have another one immediately, you are due to experience a complete paralysis of heart action. Remember what happened to the unfortunate Ezra? - The doctor is alive. This is not supporting maybe. - Yeah. He's alive. - He's only trying to fool us. - (chuckles) That's it. Just trying to pull us. I thought I plugged him good. I'll give him an injection of lead. So the doc ain't dead. - No. I got a, sort of a pain right here. - Oh, shut up. You ate too much have it your way. I'm only giving you a fair warning. (gun fires) By now you are experiencing slight pains near the heart. They will become more acute within a few minutes. I didn't think you look so good today, Jesse. - Hey, yeah, you just start something. You'll see how good I look. - Again, I say. It's up to you if you want to live. And be sensible, men. Why die like rats? When there's all of life ahead of you? - Oh, do you think it'll work? - It's a chance. I hope they didn't recognize my voice. - Anything I can do? - I'm afraid not. I've done everything possible. - Joan. I want to talk to Joan. - Yes, May. - It's hard to explain, but something has come over me. I don't know. But a short time ago, I hated you. Now, I'm sorry. Please forgive me Joan. - Of course, May. - You know, it's funny but. I want to give myself up, now. - Dirk. Dirk. - Yes, doctor. - I heard her. She'll live. To prove that, I was right. - The heat banner's on you now, doctor. - I feel as if I had been born again. - Doctor! - Ole! - Yeah, Mr. Herring? - Get more wine. - That is the last of it. - Get more wine or I'll cut your ears off. - Yes, but Mr.- - More wine, I said. - Yes, sir. - What I need is a good step drink. - Well. It might help temporarily. - We'll go down. Come on. Let's get going. Not so fast. Just a minute there. - What? - Give me that wine. - Yeah, but Mr. Herring, the Kaaba, he said he would- - Great stuff. Get me more. - That's all it there is. I found that hiding and Miss Mary's luggage. - Please. Mary's. - Get moving. - Thank goodness sake, is gonna have my ears cut off. - What's the idea? - Well, you guys having a good time, ain't you? - Thought I told you to stay on the bridge? - Maybe I got a little tired. - May I remind you, men? Your time is almost up. You only have a few minutes more. - He's done for. - Again. I say it's up to you. If you want to live. - At least they still think it's the doctor, - Maybe if I went out there, I could talk with him. - No, no, Joan. How's Mary? - Sleeping. - I think that all the doctor standard accomplished must die with him. - There's still a chance Dirk, you'll be carrying on his work. (door knocking) - Hey, Doc. - What does it Ritter? - Can I come in? - Come in one at a time with your hands up. - Ritter's mine. (thud sounds) - Three days and we're home, Bob. - We're turning the guinea pig back to the authority. And after that. - Oh. - Hey, where are you going? Hey, can't go home. (laughs) You think he can make it?
