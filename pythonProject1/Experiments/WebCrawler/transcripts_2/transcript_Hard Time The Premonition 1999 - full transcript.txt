foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- As a woman, I know better than to walk alone at night, but... in my dream, I always walk alone. I'm alone and I walk, and... and I look into the houses... 'cause there's no curtains or blinds, and I... I see the people... the families. And they smile and wave, and I wave back. Friendly. But I don't feel friendly. I feel angry. Jealous maybe, because-- because they are families and I don't have a family and I probably never will. I walk away defeated and so full of hate, I... I don't even know where I am, or... who I am. [footsteps] And then suddenly, I... I hear footsteps behind me. And then they stop. And-- And I turn. But there's no one there. It's just a....It's just a... empty street and sidewalk. And then I... I hear footsteps again, but this time it's closer. And I know now that that person wants to hurt me. So I run and I run, screaming for help, but no one helps me. I find, uh... a dark house, and I hide in the closet. But the footsteps are getting closer... and closer... until they just pause outside the door. The door opens. Inches. And I look up to see... the person ready to strike me. And it's me. You mean your father. No. Up until now, it's always been my father, but now it's me. And now the scared little girl in the closet is someone else. What do you think that means? ♪♪ [ominous, rumbling] [bell rings] [crowd chattering] [Judge] Logan McQueen. The State of Florida finds you guilty of manslaughter in the second degree. I hereby sentence you to a term of imprisonment of not more than five years and not less than one year. Said period to be served at a facility selected by the State Department of Corrections. Your commission as a sworn peace officer is hereby suspended. [men chattering] [voice on P.A.] Lockdown in section B to section D. Something's going down. Call for backup. Police! Hold it![woman screams] Hold it! [gate buzzer] I didn't kill the kid. Well, D.A. Barker thinks you did. Where's my money? Excuse me? [Barker] Half a million dollars was in that bag when it left my hands. And only $310,000 was counted out by your own forensic officers. [Logan] It was you, Charlie, who took the money. I couldn't imagine it would escalate. I never thought they'd pin Pepe on you. You betrayed me.I betrayed myself. I turn the money over to Barker, and he buys that I saw Catarato shoot Pepe. You wouldn't last two weeks in prison. No reason for both of us to end up behind bars. No matter what kind of spin Miss Myler puts on this, I'll be forced to own up to a crime that I did not commit. [bell rings] McQueen! Round's over. Let's go! Let's go. [men's taunting chatter, indistinct] [gate buzzer] Hold it. We're goin' this way. Population's havin' a meeting. Let's go. Now we're even. Get lost. You took my brother down. Now I'm taking you. Come on. Uhh! Uhh! Unhh! [yelling, shouting] [bell rings]Hold him! [Guard] Back away from the gate! [Guard] All right, break it up! [indistinct shouting] Get down! Get back! Put 'em down! Hold it right there! [gate buzzer] Okay, Logan, it's time to go to the Row. [men taunting] It's just too dangerous here for ex-cops in the general population. It's going to be lonely on Death Row, but it'll be a lot safer for you. ♪♪ [opera] [Guard] You don't have long to go, McQueen, so... just play by the rules, and we'll get you out of here in one piece. [gate closes] Open number 2. [Guard] Opening 2. [buzzer] Rather stunning... ain't I? I ain't gonna be here that long, pal. Admit it. ♪♪ [opera continues] [chuckles] Ray Earl Winston. "Lucifer's Right Hand." I know who it was. Ever see what he does to journalists? Ties 'em in knots. Get yourself another hero, pal. [prisoner coughing] Close number 2. [buzzer] [Prisoner] Logan McQueen. News travels fast through these walls. Now, the logan was a war wagon with a battering ram, used in medieval times. McQueen? "Of the queen." War wagon for the queen. Now, that's a name. My name's Sebastian Allgood. Allgood. Somewhat ironic, considering my present gravidity. You'll stop pacing, once you realize you have no place to go. I'm sorry I overreacted. Thanks for tracking that thing down. How was the family reunion? It was great. I've never seen my mom so happy. And I rounded up these old eight millimeter movies of me and my dad. When he saw it, he just crumbled. How sweet. Hey, sorry about that report being a day late. Don't worry about it. One advantage of working for Dad. I'll just blame it on Daddy's little girl. See ya. See ya. [phone rings] Good morning. Laboratory testing. [people chatting] [sigh] [Woman] I'll just blame it on Daddy's little girl. [Sebastian] Tell fortune of her blindness. Tell nature of decay. Tell friendship of unkindness. Tell justice of delay. And if they will reply, then give them all the lie. Faulkner, Cather, Hawthorne, Shakespeare. The eminent ones. They have the power to traverse the latitudes and the longitudes of time, outside these walls. Professor. Ah, speak again, bright angel. Why are you in here? Did you bore your English literature class to death? [laughing] Oh, no. It was the ultimate act of malignant narcissism. What the hell does that mean? Revenge. Oh. Premature death served no purpose for him. Or his victim. Or soon, me. He killed my wife. And you, Mr. McQueen? Well, I know it'll sound familiar... ...but...I didn't do anything wrong. Unfortunately, I did. Most of us don't get what we deserve, for which we are eternally grateful. My action, which was a commitment to revenge, has found its equal in punishment. [Woman] Brian, what are you tryin' to do? Kiss up to Dad?He's the boss. Hey, I'm off the clock. He's Dad now. You want me to stay and help you finish up? No, no, you go on ahead. Okay. [gasps] Gonna be a while. Take the stairs if you're in a hurry. [sighs] Hello? Can anybody hear me? [door opens] [gasp] Hello? [door closes] [footsteps] [metal pipe drops][gasp] [door opens] [hinges squeal, door closes] [grating, clattering] [bang] The elevator's fixed. [clicking switch] [elevator bell rings] Hey there. Aah! Walk me to my car. I feel so silly, I really scared myself, didn't I? Are you gonna be all right? Yeah, I'll be fine. Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.Good night. [police sirens] [beep beep] ♪♪ [ominous wordless choir] [buzzing] [rumbling tone] Ohh! Logan McQueen. Caught...back in between. Logan. Logan. [tauntingly] Logan. [crow cawing] [knock knock knock] Professor. Logan. I think I would like to borrow a book. Good. Let's see. Billy Budd. An innocent man swings from the yardarm, betrayed by his shipmates. Not his fault. But it was his fate. He knew that. That was his beauty.Well, thank you very much. Now I know how it ends. No, Logan. You don't. [gate buzzer in distance] Captain Waters. Detective Higgs. I want a shot at the bombing case. You do? That's a pretty tough case for a rookie detective. Bombs and murder mean press and politicians. That makes for a long day and maybe a short career. I'll work 26 hours a day. I'll think about it. [footsteps] We'll be movin' you over tomorrow. You, uh...decide on your last meal? Just tell His Honor that a meal won't be needed. I'm no longer consumed with being. [Guard] You want to see the chaplain? My soul has all the footing I'll ever need. Good night. [gate buzzer] [prisoner coughing] Professor. Yes, Logan. I didn't know you were leaving us so soon. I've been here a long time. And only a little... with a friend. Logan... I want you to know something. Yes? Forgiveness. Forgiveness? Go on. Your anger. You were forced to write a book without knowledge. Forced to build a wall without stones. I'm not sure I understand. You will. You will. [Radio Announcer] Now, that's a check of the weather and the traffic together. Turning to local news. Funeral Services are to be held today for car victim Janine Junkermann. Police Detectives say the background check of the 31-year-old woman is still in progress. They continue to search out for possible motives in the bombing. Police say they have little to say. Open number 1. [buzzer] Allgood. It's time to move you over. I'm already there. Permission to speak to Mr. McQueen? Did you know that state law requires the executioner actually to sterilize the needle? I see you're absconding, too. Yes. We'll both be free. Logan, about Duffy. It is very difficult for a man to remain a wonder to his family. In all of time, very few men have. I would like Logan to have this book. Perhaps someday that will resonate within. When it does, touch one, so that others may be touched. Thank you, Sebastian. [buzzer] Nice flowers. Got a secret lover, Miss Karen? He's no secret. We're engaged. Lucky guy. Good night. See you tomorrow. See you. [ominous wordless choir] [rumbling tone]Uhh! [rumbling tone continues] Mr. McQueen! Mr. McQueen! Can you remember a bad dream? [Prisoner] Shut up.I'm living one right now. I've just had a dreadful dream I would love to tell. Visions of cars and dreams of bombs. Pretty women tangled in the fires of hell. [Prisoner] Tell somebody who cares! I just did. I just told someone who cares. [gate opens] [Guard] Open number 2. [buzzer] Must feel pretty good gettin' out of here. And we only just met. Yeah. I'm sorry we didn't get to talk. How many were there? 14. And I condemn myself. You know, I begged God... to form me differently. But he blessed me with a capacity... for cruelty. But it's the face of the bomber. That's the thing that's so odd, Detective... McQueen, obviously no longer a part of the machine. But don't go away. I see the bastard's face. [Prisoner] Shut up, Winston! Just as plain as day. The man's a poet. [men chattering] [Duffy] Hey, come on. Give us a break, you know? We're retired cops, you know? He made a mistake, but who doesn't? [Duffy] We're more than friends. You know, when you've been partners as long as me and Logan, you think the same. That's the thing. You know every move the other's gonna make. Two more minutes, and you move it. He'll come out, jump in, and I'm gone. There he is now! Hey, Logan! Mary and Joseph, you look great! Hey, your hair's a little long, but you can get that cut. You lost a little weight, huh? Hey, where you goin'? Hey, I got the car right here. What? You forgot you forgave me? Want me to meet you over there? Okay, wait there. I said wait there, will ya? Where do you think you're goin'? He's just circlin' the block. Get in the car. I'll take you to a barber shop. Oh, are you still mad at me? Logan. You wanna walk? Walkin' is good. That-- That's healthy. Yeah, you still think I shoulda-- I should've turned the money in? It wouldn't have helped you, and you know that. You still would have gone in. Ohh...Logan... [stammers] [car horn] Uhh! Uhh! [screeching tires] [Driver] Nice driving, moron! We still have some debris to sift through. The only thing that connects both cases are those cards found at the crime scene. Anything on 'em? Disjointed lettering. Symbolism. A message. Some form of symbolism. It's handwritten Gothic style. There's no results yet from the FBI lab on inks, paper stock, bomb components. No prints, witnesses. Other than the cards, there's no leads. Well, find some, detective. [Man] I was playing with Woody Herman's band. That's where I met GoGo Gloria. She was a real good sport. She traveled with the band. She didn't sing or anything. She just traveled with the band. She had a whole lot of round bruises on her body, from guys touching her with a ten-foot pole. I'll never forget the first time I saw her. She was sitting on the Golden Gate Bridge, dangling her feet in the water. Logan, my man. Where you been? Oh, I was havin' so much fun, I lost track of time. Hey, what kept you? [chuckles] I beat you here, huh? Your money's no good here today. My money was no good where I was, but it's good here. Not today. I'm buyin'. Not this time, Charlie. Got your stuff in the back. Good. You know, you're welcome to stay in Bo's room till you get back on your feet. Who's Bo? ♪♪ [blues] [soft growl] The vet says he's got another year to grow. I hope you didn't pay for him by the pound. Just a puppy, huh? Yeah. Cute, isn't he? Yeah. When he gets to be real size, he'll make me look thin. That'll never happen. [laughter] You know, I was thinkin'. I could put a phone line for you in here. It'd be your own place. Bo's and my place. Bo, you got a problem if Logan stays in your room for a while? He says it's cool. He did? One thing, though. Please don't give him any people food. He's got a fizzy stomach. [soft growling] All right. You have your own zip code. [Bo panting] [soft whimper] [panting loudly] I feel guilty about this, but I... I think I'm actually gonna feel relieved when he's dead. You need to trust that there's a life as yourself. Not as a dark seed waiting to sprout in my father's trail. I'm not sure what I'm capable of anymore. Whether I like or not, I am his daughter. It sure is good to see you here, Mr. McQueen. Well, it's good to be seen anywhere. And no one knows about it. It's our little secret. Damn! Well. It looks great. I want to tell you somethin' I haven't said in about a year. Thank you, Davey, I took her out a couple of times. She still runs like a scalded dog. The trophies are in the trunk. Trophies? You mean you had it in competition? Logan! I got a carburetor that ain't carburatin'. Well. You look different. Youlook different. I mean, uh... you got a jacket on. You're out of uniform. I'm a detective now. I'm proud of you, kid. Thank you, sir. Listen, I could use some advice on a case I'm doing from a fellow detective. I ain't no detective. It's turned serial. It's two female victims. Both car bombings. The case is about to blow wide open. I'm listening. [Radio Host] You're tuned to Miami's best talk. And today we're taking about these car bombings. Now, look, the police say these incidents are unrelated, that there's no reason to panic. I don't know about you folks, but, I mean, I'm not buying this. I'm thinking serial killer. [Logan] He wanted to know if I'd had any dreams. Tells me he's having dreams about women and fires of hell, car bombs. He says that he sees the face of the man responsible. [Woman caller] I'm ridin' the bus. I'm not gonna get in no car while this guy is out there blowin' women up. [Radio Host] Now, hold on. First of all, what makes you think this is a guy? Huh? Women are equally capable of inflicting pain and sorrow, lady. Welcome to the nineties. Don in Coral Gables, you're on Miami's best talk. [Male caller] Has everyone forgotten Biscayne and what happened there five years ago? ♪♪ [blues] Sorry about his breath. This should help, though. Not now. Go away. Could I at least ask the question first? No, thanks. Winston won't talk to anybody but you. So what? What's happened to you? What's happened? What's happened is I feel no obligation to you or your fellow police officers. You see, they took away my badge and my name. Well, the captain says he'll pay you. 25 years of pension they took away from me. So you'll do it? I'll think about it. [gate slams closed] ♪♪ [opera] [buzzer] [gate opens] [turns music off] What? Is that for me? Here's your mail. Thank you. Wagner. Wagner. Big stuff. Why did they move you to Sebastian's cell? That's the way it goes. Next man down... gets moved in here. You're the next man to walk? Well, I'm paying ultimate retail in very short time. I guess I'll be, uh... seeing your friend Sebastian. No, I doubt that. Every one of my victims had a more beautiful death than any single thing any one of them ever did in their entire life! Trust me. You wanted to tell me something about your dreams. You went to school, right? Yes. Well, obviously, then you understand that everything has a price. What's your price? Two things. Prisoner here, Ernie Haflin. He gets released. He's only got two months to go. And then, uh... ...my daughter comes to see me. I'm not sure I can grant all those requests. You give me nothing... I give you...nothing. I don't understand. Just tell the police what it is I want. I'll even give you a preview of my dream. The killer leaves a little calling card... at every scene. Correct? I don't know. You will. Now, if you'll excuse me. I have another meeting. Those are copies of the calling cards found at the crime scene. What else didn't you show me, Mr. Higgs? The Captain wanted you to see Winston without knowing any of the inside details. He wanted to make sure that Winston's dreams were legit. Here, you want to see the rest of the file? You might wanna take a look at these. Oh. All the bombings took place within an 8-mile radius. What the hell kind of device did he use? I'm still waiting on the lab test. In other words, you don't know nothin'. Who's gonna contact the daughter? Winston insists that youdo it. I haven't been paid yet for my conversation with the Prince of Darkness. You will be. The Captain says he'll throw in an extra $500 to talk to the daughter. Make it 7. I have to get a haircut. Thanks a lot. She's great. [chuckles] Hi. I'm-- I thought your wife was coming, too. No. Just-- Just me. Come on in. We'll do it over here. Oh, why not? You're not afraid, are you? Not yet. You won't feel much. Well, that's too bad, 'cause, you know, I like to feel something. Don't you like to feel something? Sit. I only do arms, backs, and chests. No privates, no legs. Infections are too risky. How did you get interested in this? It's a hobby. [electric needle buzzes] I think we have a misunderstanding. I'm here to talk to you about your father. My what? Your father. Who sent you? The police. [takes off gloves] Get out.Sorry? Get out! I'll take that as a no. Now! Hi. I'm Bud Dee. I'm here for you to do me. You do serpents? Yeah. Great. Come on in. Wait in here. She'll do your arms and, you know, chest, but she doesn't do private parts or anything like that. Just get out of here! Your father wants to see you. Do you have a subpoena or a summons? No, I don't, I don't have either one. Then get the hell out! [gate closes, bell rings] ♪♪ [classical] [Prisoner] Hoo hoo! Hello, baby! Well. Back so soon? It's not happening. Excuse me? It's not happening. They need proof that your dreams are true. It's not happening. And yet you show up with a rather lovely young art student. They need more information. [chuckles] You know, until my conditions are met... I'm simply not gonna tell you about my dreams. You have to give me more. Well, I was right about the cards, wasn't I? You were right about the cards, yes. But that doesn't help them catch the bomber. Haflin walks out. My daughter comes here to see me. That's two. And then you get to hear what my dream is. That's three. Your daughter does not want to see you. That is not her fault. She would rather have her fingernails pulled out... than see you. You are so sophomoric. What about Haflin? They're working on it. I'm very disappointed in you, Mr. McQueen. Well, I'm used to that. My mother wanted me to be a doctor. I loved my mother. I didn't likeher. She sent me down the road that I took. It all came out at my trial. All kinds of evidence. And I told the truth. I'm guilty. But you know what's odd? Nobody, not one soul, ever asked me why. Don't you find that odd? I think the doctor called it a "transference of aggression." I couldn't kill my own mother. I didn't even know what women looked like. Why did you pick me? Because you understand pain. And we have a bond. You're wrong. Oh, no. If you wanna see your daughter, you give me some proof, some information that I can take to her and show her that you tried to help get this bomber! There's gonna be another bombing. Tonight. A young woman. Her first name begins with an "S." Susan. Maybe Sandra. A Samantha. You dreamed this? Check for any female first names beginning with "S." Concentrate on Sandra and Susan. Those were the two names he used. Dan, you got that list? Yes, sir. All right. Anything? [beeping] [Radio Reporter] No leads, no motives, no suspects in the city's car bombings. These were the words of the police investigators on hand today when questioned at City Hall at a press conference. Police said that... [crowd chatter] I want these people out of here now. No! No more questions. We said everything we're going to say. Thank you. No more questions. [Radio] We cannot catch a guy running around with wires and plastic explosives, crawling under you car. Come on, people. Don't worry, Daddy, I didn't tell Mom anything. [Dad] I want it to be a surprise. As far as she knows, my party is a complete surprise. Okay. Well, get here as soon as you can. I will. I'll hurry. I love you. I love you, too, Daddy. [ominous wordless choir] [explosion] I'm tellin' you, this whole thing is nuts. I agree with you. Releasing Haflin, a convicted felon. So what? He only has two months to go. This woman's name was Sandra. Okay, it's just like he said. Sandra. How the hell does he know that? That's pretty thin, don't you think? When I was there, he never had a single visitor. He hasn't had a visitor in 7 years. His cell is searched daily. Mail's clean. Never calls anybody, and nobody calls him. You talked to him twice. I think you qualify as his best friend. I'm flattered. Captain Waters says we gotta give him what he wants. Oh, he does, does he? Yeah. He says, "What do we threaten him with? He's already on Death Row." What the hell is the connection between Haflin and Winston? Haflin is a small-time con artist. His father knew Winston. Well, you know now that Haflin's out, he's gonna do somethin' for Winston. We're on him. What I need you to do is take another run at the daughter. She hates me as much as she hates her father. I hated my father at times growing up, but I still loved him. How many women did your father kill? [police siren] [car door closes] [starts motor] [chatting] [Guard] Open number 2. Haflin, let's go. You're out of here. [buzzer] The Attorney General stuck his neck out, but it's our head that's in the noose. I wanna know where Haflin is every second-- what he eats, when he sleeps. This guy could shed some light on the bombings. I hope. Okay. [Higgs] Mr. Burton, I'm very sorry about what happened to your daughter. They give the beginning detectives the grief counseling, huh? Listen, I will do everything possible to make sure that justice is served. You know how I see it? Justice? It would have been just if my daughter could have lived her whole life out. I'd feel a lot better, detective, if you had a little less shoe leather. Grief counseling! Shoe leather! What the hell is that supposed to mean, "shoe leather"? I think he's right. He didn't come here to see a preacher, you know. He's lookin' for a bad-ass cop. Like you were? Yeah. Well, look where it got you. I always hated this office. [knock at door] [knocking]Dee, open up! Come on, I know you're in there.[pounding] Let's go! Ernie, is that you? Who else are you expecting? You never know! You gonna let your brother in? You alone? I doubt it. You look good. [stuttering] You-- You-- You-- You look like crap. [mocking] You-- You-- You-- You. You spend five years in a crap hole, you look like crap. Winston r-really got you out, huh? When are you gonna grow up? How is the old man? How's he supposed to be? He's lookin' at the needle in a few days. H-He say anything about me? You? Yeah, he sends his regards. That's it? His regards? Nice fish. That's what he said? He sends his "regards"? Nothin' else? Nothin' else what? Winston. Nothin' else about me? No. What's he supposed to say? I mean, it's hard enough for him to get a message to me, you know? What'd he get you out for? He's got an errand he wants done. I guess I'm the only guy he trusts. What? Just a little something. That doesn't concern you. The department's profiler thinks Winston's daughter fits the psychological M.O. for a serial killer. Let me ask you a question. Where Janice works, does she have access to chemicals, stuff to put together a bomb? She not only has access, she has the expertise to use it. You fight southpaw? Yeah. But you're right-handed. Yeah. Yeah, I've-- I've never boxed a southpaw before. Nothin' to it. Now, see how I made you move to your left? Yeah. What am I doin'? I'm making you go left. Yeah? You know why? Why? Ohh! You don't wanna come into that hook, see? Yeah. So, you wanna keep circling this way, right? Ah! Uh-oh. A punch. Yeah? I'm not as fast as I used to be. Mm-hmm.I lead with my right, you just come over the top. Like this! Or like that? Yeah. Felt good. Thinking maybe, uh... I should ask Janice a couple of questions. Well...do yourself a favor. Stay away from Janice. Yeah? Sounds more like you're doing yourself a favor. Really? Yeah! Ohh! [Man] Ohh! Ohh! Listen, kid... I don't do anybody favors. [breathlessly] That was a good punch. Hi. Flowers are the earth's way of smiling. You read that in a book? A book by Tibetan monks. And what's so special about them? Because they give their lives to God? Can I come in for a second? I'll leave, you know. I mean, all you gotta do is just say go, and... I'm outta here. Okay? You're a cop? Well, I used to be, yeah. My name is Logan McQueen. I don't have all day, Mr. McQueen. Yeah, I can see you're very busy. You know, they grow right up through cow manure. And the more manure, the stronger they grow. If that was the case, I'd be about 35 feet tall. [laughs] Can we sit down, just for a second? Well? Winston knows way too much about the car bombings. Details that only the killer or the police would know. And how do you know this? Well, this is gonna sound...strange, but... we were, uh...neighbors. Uh, I was, uh... in the same cellblock. See, when I was a cop, I... It's a long story. I don't have time for your long story. Okay. He's predicting...things. Details. About victims. Now, my father is no psychic. He's psycho. Maybe he's just asking for forgiveness. He is looking for a one-way ticket back from the dead. And you don't even know it yet, but you are playing his game. I'm not playin' his game. I'm just tryin' to keep someone from being killed. He won't give me any more information until you go to see him. All the victims were women. Your age. All of Winston's victims were women my age. He knows something from somewhere. I was a junior in college engaged to be married... ...when the details started to come out of who he killed and how he-- And at first, I didn't-- I didn't believe them because he was my father. Midway through the trial, my-- my fiancé... broke off our engagement, and my so-called friends, they started to look the other way. I didn't blame them because I couldn't even look at myself. I started to take on his guilt. Except...he didn't have any guilt. [sniffles] [breathes shakily, sniffles] [sigh] You know, my eyes aren't brown, and my hair comes out of a bottle. Got a new nose, a new name. I buried her. So please... You know, I've walked through a few mine fields. Think I stepped on every mine that was there. I know about betrayal. About losing everything you have. If you want to talk sometime... ...about anything... [beeping] Uhhh! [Woman] He's moving. Get set. What do you want?! I'm out. Not on parole. Out. I got a life to rebuild here. Leave me alone. Wanna tell me what you're doin' out here for your friend Winston? I'm doin' nothin'. He was a friend of my father's. He got me out as a favor. Are we supposed to believe that? Why ain't you home havin' babies? [loud chatter] [loud chatter in Spanish] [police sirens] [loud street chatter] You got something for us? Cool. [indistinct chatter] Shit. [laughs] Hey, check this out. Hi. Whoa, whoa, whoa. My money no good? Your money's fine. We appreciate it. Oh, you're gonna keep it, huh? That's right. Whoa. That was forty dollars' worth. I'll come back next week again and get forty dollars' worth from you. Muscle, take Mr. Haflin down to number four. Just...wait here. Go ahead. [chuckles] ♪♪ [Blues] [Logan] Entrez-vous. [growls] Does he bite? Just cops. Yeah. I brought your money. No, no, no. I don't take checks. So, tell me what happened. I followed him into this dive. And then I had my little altercation. Well, great. So we just get a search warrant, go in, and search the place. I don't think that'll do any good, Mr. Higgs. I think he went in, got what he wanted, and got out. We've gone over every inch of the crime scene about fifty times now. I don't think these bombs are personal. I don't think they're about revenge. I think they're about somethin' else. What? Don't you see the similarity between the Winston killings and the bombings? Now, that was about being somebody. I think this guy wants to see his name in the paper. [Bo pants loudly] Where you been?Ohh! You-- Are you crazy? I've been worried about you. I did that thing for Winston. [laughs] I got you! [laughing] Whoa. That's Winston's stash, Dee. His stash? It's all gotta be worth a quarter mill. Why do you got it? It's for his daughter. He thinks she's gonna come visit him before he takes the needle. Like an inheritance? Yeah. Only she ain't gettin' it. Mmmhh. You're gonna cross him? I got other plans. He trusted you. We're gonna get away from here. You and me, little brother. Yeah. Yeah, great. Right. Yes. [chuckles] [Radio] A spokesperson for the Police Department [phone rings] scientific investigation division, has said that everything is being done to expedite the investigation. The spokesperson would not comment at this time what similarities, if any... [Machine] Bo's place. I'm not here, but Bo is, and he's listening. [beep] Logan, this is Janice Lynn. I just saw the news. I need to talk. We need to meet. [Bo growling] [beep] They're blond, and they're professional. And according to my little pin drop on the map, folks, all these bombings are taking place in about an 8-mile radius. We'll go to Louis who used to be a police officer up in Carol City. Louis, you're on Miami's best talk. Yeah, I'm an ex-cop, and I'll tell you the problem is all these silly laws and judges gettin' in the police officers' way. My day, you stopped a guy, you searched the car. Now you gotta call a judge to ask a guy what his name is. That's the problem with everything now. Okay, enough of the polite talk. I didn't come here for a date. Oh, that's a relief, you know, because I didn't wanna have a date with you. Besides, the food isn't any good here. Are you having me followed? No, but I could. Somebody has been asking about me down at the lab. Human Resources says there's a background check in progress. If it's your cop friends, I want you to tell them to stop. Oh, I could tell 'em. Wouldn't help. And I want you to stay away, too. I will. Okay, I will. Do. Mmm. This is on the house. Not now. Not Now. Oh. Uh...[chuckles, sets glasses down] I don't do this. You don't do what? You don't drink? Drink with men. Why not? Well, eventually the conversation gets around to me, and when they find out I'm the daughter of... Oh. I see. "Check, please."[pouring wine] The honest ones do. The others, they can't wait to tell their friends. [chuckles] Yeah. It's important to have somebody to talk to. Somebody that-- Well, I had a-- I had a partner. He was like a father to me. The only man I ever trusted. He betrayed me. Forgiveness is hard for you. Oh. At last we have something in common. It's gonna break my heart if you two don't order something. Well, we wouldn't want to do that. What? Order something or break my heart? Either. Either. Oh! [chuckles] [crickets chirping] [chuckles] I had fun. Oh. Well... I had funner. [both chuckle] I think I actually was laughing. Oh, you laughed. Yeah. It's not like me. Oh, maybe it's, uh, it's the real you. Thank you for making sure I got home safely. It was very sweet of you to go out of your way. It wasn't out of my way. Yeah. You-- You live at Trumpet's. Yeah, I do, I... Well, it was a little out of my way, but... it wasn't a... a lot out of my way. Okay. Okay. Yeah. You know, I have a pretty good bottle of wine. We could go out on my patio and talk, and I could laugh some more, and... Laugh. Um... wine. Patio [chuckles] That's... I haven't done this in a long time. I'm... ...you know, rusty. You know. I'm not very good at it. Okay. Good night. Ho! Whoa! No, hold it! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Don't-- Don't-- Don't, uh... Don't let me... talk you out of it. Mmm. I promise I won't, uh, I won't-- I won't rush you into things. Oh. Rush. Rush. Hmm. Well, if you have a violent urge to rush, [laughs] go right ahead. Hey, there's wine in the kitchen... Mm-hmm... glasses in the cupboard. You can chill them in the freezer. I'll be right back. All right. Wine is in the freezer. The glasses are in the cupboard. You put them in the freezer. And then I'm... Oh, what the hell, I'll find it. [wind chimes] [wind chimes] ♪♪ [ominous] Janice. Janice! [car engine starts up] [car speeds off] [police radio] ...requesting backup. [Dispatcher] We're sending backup. [Woman] I've been through that area. Mark everything, what? Series "C." Why do you think she ran? I don't know. Maybe she got bored with me. What were you guys doing here? We were talking! She mention she was under psychiatric care? What the hell's the matter with you? If Winston was your father, you'd be out baying at the moon. She has to talk to somebody. Yeah, well, her doctor tells me she's having psychotic episodes. Seeing burning bodies. What the hell ever happened to doctor-patient confidentiality? Listen, she had the means, she had the expertise. She is not the bomber! You don't know that. The hell I don't! Look at that! Look at it! It's so obvious that it's a paid job, even you could see it! I've been waiting for a break on this case for weeks. Okay, maybe her psychotic episodes are real! Huh? Did you ever think of that? The daughter of Lucifer's Right Hand carries on the family tradition. It'll play great in the press! Ohh! Sorry. I'm gonna need some time. Oh, this is gonna take some time. Gotta get all this evidence sorted out. How much time? 48 hours. You know what I recommend for the lip? What's that? Salt and ice. Don't forget the tequila. Where in the hell is your brain? We should be on our way to Mexico by now. It serves my purpose. It's all a game. A game? You are out of your mind! Just like Winston is! You're sounding just like our father. He didn't like Winston, either. I didn't like it when he talked like that. I fixed him! Maybe you should think about gettin' rid of her car. I didn't bring it here. Do it for me? Don't be scared.

Then we're back to the old arithmetic again. Let's talk about opera. The bomber's calling card. [laughs]It adds up to "Rigoletto." Mr. McQueen lands on the green. You wanna hear about my latest dream? No! I wanna talk about who's responsible. The girl is blond. She works in a lab. She's got a name. Her name is Lynn. What's the matter? Did I offend you with what I said? [chuckles] You're talking about Janice. Janice? Janice, your daughter. That's right. She changed everything. She changed her hair, she changed her face. She changed her name. Her name is Janice Lynn. What? She's the next to go! What are you talkin' about? I'm talkin' about who is responsible! You hear me very, very clearly. Dee Haflin! He wanted a father. I needed somebody to trade information with the police with. Just so I could see my daughter one more time before I died, for God's sake. I know I broke her heart. How'd you communicate? Bar codes. CDs. CDs would come to me, and they had bar codes on the front of 'em. We had our own alphabet. I knew exactly who he was gonna kill. I knew when he was gonna kill 'em. I knew where. What else? What else? What else?! Take the man's life! It's rather obvious. You remember how Rigolettoends?

Nothin'. But that don't mean there's no rats down there. We can tell Higgs we looked. Oh, we-- we did. They'll be leaving soon. [Logan] I'm telling you, Janice is not a suspect. She's the next victim. Now we've gotta find her. Okay, Higgs? [sigh] They found Janice's car. Little Havana. Stripped it down. The only prints that were identifiable were the Haflin brothers' and Janice's. This kid is playing a deadly game of hide and seek. Your problem is gettin' home without gettin' tagged. What'd you just say?About what? About the game? I said your problem is gettin' home without gettin' tagged. That's it. Why...Why, Charlie used to say that. He'd say, "When you can't find it, look down. It's right in front of you." [moans] Shh! Shh! [muffled attempt to talk] Shh! It sucks havin' to be awake for this, doesn't it? I'm sorry. Shhh! Shhh.

He said I could be somebody. [chuckles] People respect fear. He said that they would call me master of the game, but he didn't care, really. That was just a lie. A lie. Lie. No, I'm sure.

Get away from me! No! No! Uuhh! Ohh! I, uh... wrote this for her. I tried to... ...I don't know, write it all down. Tried to explain it. I-- I don't know that I even... can explain it to myself. You know I can't take that. [indistinct prisoner shouting] I just, uh... I'd like her to know that I loved her. That's all. I'm afraid it's... late. I'm goin' down soon. There are, uh... are not gonna be any friendly faces. I wonder... would you...please be there for me? Yes. [buzzer] [Woman on radio] And according to a spokesman for the Mayor's Office, a vote will be forthcoming. And in other news... He came in drunk while I was closin'. I watered his drinks, but, uh... smells like a long-term bender to me. [Radio] ...was executed at 12:01 this morning. Ray Earl Winston had been on Death Row for over... Come on, guy. Oh, Logan. Come on. Logan...you gotta talk to me. You gotta. I can't stand it. All right, Bo. Here you go. [panting heavily] Logan? Logan. You gotta forgive me. [tearfully] I can't stand it. Uh...Logan? Are you out of breath, Logan? [mumbling] Oh. You're there, Logan. Well, Sebastian. I've read the book four times now. I'm doing all right on balance. But I'm still working on forgiveness. Thank you. That's just what I wanted to say. [seagulls squawking] Well. What a fantastic job you've done of healing. [laughs] You sure know how to flatter a girl. The prison sent, um... sent me a letter from my father. Yes. No, I can't forget what he was or what he did. Forgetting and forgiveness are very far apart. Should I read it? Well... I think that's something that you'll have to decide all by yourself. [tearing paper] [chuckles] [sigh] [Sebastian] Perhaps someday that will resonate within. When it does, touch one so that others may be touched.
