We're at your house, a search warrant. What are you looking for? More interesting is what we found. You received money, from Veronika Etlinger, 20 years, again and again. She was my friend. A very good friend. What was the money for? Three years ago Mrs. Etlinger died in the fire. The money didn't come. They turned to Marlene Stöhr. Why? Why should you suddenly get money from Marlene Stöhr? My pension is not enough. That's nonsense, Ms. Gensch. We were connected because of circumstances. The sons Oliver and Ferdinand were born at the same time here. ♪carried music♪ Ferdinand was five years old severely ill. But something was wrong with the blood work. What was wrong? Ferdinand wasn't Veronika's son. The boy was switched at birth. And I helped her figure out with whom. The mothers had showered their children with love for five years. And you uncovered the truth? I should be quiet after that. Excuse me? Veronika and Marlene were not ready, exchange their children. Likewise they couldn't live with the loss. ♪moving music♪ So they each became godparents of their own child? Yes, the moms became friends, Family.

I should have reported it to the hospital. It doesn't make any difference. For the kids that makes a difference. A really huge one, in my opinion. Marlene Stöhr wanted to speak to Oliver, says her son. Something very important. Yes, because Oliver is Gernot Etlinger's biological son. And Marlene wanted Oliver to find out before Gernot dies. And that it might help. With what? The man loses his liver. He will die of cirrhosis. It's his last chance. For what? For a suitable living donation. Oliver would have been an option. From son to father. That was Marlene's obsession. ♪tense music♪ did you know Hm, dad, did you know? did you know No, don't touch me.
