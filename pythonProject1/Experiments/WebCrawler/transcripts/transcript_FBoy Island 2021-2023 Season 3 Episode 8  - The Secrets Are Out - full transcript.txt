Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- Daniella: C.J. -- I still don't know anything about him. He could be a nice guy. He could be an f-boy. At this time, all I can do is take that in. I do have other connections here. Vince: I can't help but feel heartbroken. It took a lot out of me to say I love you to Katie. ♪♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ Nikki: Tonight, one by one, you will reveal if you came here as a nice guy or an f-boy. ♪ I think you want my spot ♪ Evander. I did come here as an f-boy. E.J.. I'm a f-boy as well. Marco. I'm a nice guy. Christian. I came here as a nice guy. C.J. I came here as a f-boy. Jared. I did come here as an f-boy. Mercedes. I came here as an f-boy. Vince. I came as a nice guy. Benedict. I came here... as an f-boy. -What? -What?! Man: Are you joking? ♪♪ ♪ I like them boys ♪ ♪ I like them boys ♪ ♪♪ Everyone's like, just shook. -No. No. -What the f-- Is this for real? Is this guy really a f-boy? But he is. So that's the game. I've been heartbroken. Man: No way. I came back. I thought it would be fun. I thought I could win some money. Katie: The first time I met Benedict, he said, I'm here for you. So suddenly I'm questioning everything about the connection that I was so confident in. I have no idea now where he stands. But I never expected to meet somebody that's -- I don't want to hear it. I really don't. You literally was like, "I see you as my girlfriend." How am I supposed to believe anything you say to me? And I had these very open and transparent conversations. And you sit there and you try to validate my my concerns, as if I'm crazy for questioning your intentions with me. And you want to just sit there and just point blank say, "I'm an f-boy." That's what you want to say. I came here in a different head space, met you -- At my expense. I didn't know I'd meet someone like you here. I'm a nice guy deep down. I don't think you know who you are. Truly. I'm really sorry. Me, too. Oh, my God. Alright, Benedict. Thank you. Benedict: Glad to get that off my chest. I'm glad Katie knows. It's hard to see her upset, but I know deep down she knows who I really am, so I'm gonna have to prove it with my actions. It's my only option. It's what I've got to do. Nice guys, f-boys -- everything's out in the open now. And just because no one got eliminated tonight does not mean you're safe. Far from it. Head back to the Bro Chateau, think about what you've done. Let's get the hell out of here. I want out of here right now. Get me out of these heels! Get me out of this dress! I'm so glad we had pizza because I need some [bleep] comfort food. ♪♪ ♪ Wanna fight? Get in the ring ♪ ♪ If you say what you mean ♪ ♪ This will be the time to show me ♪ ♪ That you can back it up ♪ There was quite a few shockers last night. Hey, girls. Girls: Hi. How are you? As good as we can be. Yeah. You're in mourning, I'm guessing. Can we talk about Benedict? He said, like, "I came here as one thing, but I met you," you know? OK, then when did that happen? When was the switch for you emotionally? Right. Last night, I think it was very telling when he said, "I thought it would be fun." It also plays into the whole Instagram stuff you saw and were like, "Oh, is this about your career?" Yeah. Or his lack of career, because there's money here. Yes. Like, I'm sorry, I'm just gonna -- I'm done being nice. Yes. You know, like, I'm here for my experience and my journey, and this is supposed to be my, like, redo for finding love. And I'm not gonna let some f-boy ruin that for me. Well, last night was eventful, would you say? Man: Very. [ Laughter ] Very. Benny was a surprise to me. You guys didn't know? -No. No, bro. -We did not know. Man: I thought it was a joke. Katie was visibly upset when I told her I was an f-boy. And you know, it's hard to see that, but I'm willing to do whatever I can to fight for Katie. It's the only reason I'm here. I'm gonna fix this. So for me, I had in my mind Mercedes was an f-boy because he did this already as an f-boy. Yeah. Evander threw me through a loop. I just feel like they played me. Like, I feel stupid a little bit. Yeah. I came on to the island with a goal in mind -- to leave with someone that I can trust. At the moment, I don't trust any of them. Yeah. It's hurtful to know that all my guys are f-boys. I would like to think that I have better judgment than that, and I just really don't want to open up and give these guys another chance. I really thought Jared was an f-boy that could be reformed. I thought Christian was a nice guy. And then C.J., it was a letdown to hear because he has been trying and making efforts. I just would have been so pleasantly surprised by C.J. But I mean, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's usually an f-boy. Obviously, you all know my character. Y'all know I'm hella chill and down to earth, so people probably wouldn't have expected -- or it was a little bit on the fence whether, "Oh, I don't know if C.J.'s a nice guy or, you know, but -- Man: I told you, bro, the dangly earrings. Dangly earrings. Yeah, I told you, bro. The dangly earrings. I wasn't surprised. It's the broccoli haircut for me. A nice guy. [ Laughter ] Well, each of you are going to have 3-on-1 dates this week. That means one date with three of your guys, so have fun on them. I can't wait to hear about it. Good luck and thank you for trusting this even after the devastating news of last night. Truly, I appreciate it. Thanks, girls. Girls: Thank you. ♪♪ As you can see, I brought you to the volleyball courts. Sweet. Because volleyball is very important to me. After last night's drama and intensity, I just wanna have fun, let loose a little bit, and, uh, play with some balls. ♪♪ Bomb, set, and spike it. Let's do it. Yeah? Let's just spike it. Alright. Well, it looks like the teams are already split up. So, uh... Benedict: Four way date? Not my fave. I got some catching up to do with Katie, and with two dudes there, it's not gonna be easy, but I think I'll figure it out. Marco: I'm super competitive. I'm an absolute athletic specimen, so call me a famous director because I'm about to Spike Lee. I got to loosen these hammies up. [ Laughs ] You guys ready? Yup. Yeah, yeah. Oh. That's me. Set me up. Oh. Nice hit! [Bleep]. Oh. That's it. -I got it. -Oh, [bleep]. Oh, nice, nice. Not bad, dawg. Oh, [bleep]. [ All shouting ] Shirt off! We don't have a handshake. Hey. Hey. I know right now they're on that date. It has to be Katie and Vince actually having a date, and then Marco and Benny having their own separate date. Yeah. You know. The bromance is real. The second he saw him walk in here, he was just head over heels for the dude. Oh, what's up man? Yo, can I get a sec? ♪♪ ♪♪ I mean, he literally shaved his legs to be like Benedict. To be like Benny. I mean, like, you can't make this stuff up. -Nice. Nice. [ Indistinct conversation ] ♪ Dumb as before by the look in your eyes ♪ [ Shouting ] No, no! Oh! Let's go! Let's go! I can see that there's something so special between us. Oh, we need a handshake. And I just hope that she is gonna be able to meet me halfway. [ Grunting ] [ Laughter ] Hey, Vince. Pump the brakes, daddy. Katie: Game point. Ready? Let's go, baby. ♪ She loves the adrenaline ♪ Oh, just -- Uh, that was game. Think we should mix it up? Good game. I think Marco should be on my team. Let's go! Alright. So it's gonna be like... One more handshake. Get it. [ Laughs ] Oh, there you go. Over. Yeah, good spot. Oh! Jesus. Bring it around. Yeah. Oh. I don't know about that. [ Laughs ] Knowing that Marco is a nice guy, there's a part of me that wants to reward that. I date nice guys. I've seen a lot of growth in him over these past few weeks, so it's important for me to explore our connection quicker, because there is a lot of lost time to make up for. Let's try short. [Bleep]! Go! Oh, no! Nice try. Damn it! Water break! Alright. God, we're manly. Hello. Oh, hey. So I do have a trophy to give out today. Ooh, let's go. I know this person has just really stepped it up and has been vulnerable and put themselves out there and continues to share their heart. I would love to give this trophy to... ♪♪ Marco. ♪♪ Oh my God, thank you so much. Thank you. So thank you. I appreciate you so much. I appreciate you. Nice guys win usually, so I just want to make that a known thing. Thank you. Putting this right next to the picture of us, I'm never leaving sight of this trophy. I'm sleeping with it. I'm taking it with me in the shower. I am gonna bring it on flights with me. I'm gonna do everything with this precious little piece of gold that Katie gave to me and not anyone else. I'm very glad you're a nice guy. Thank you. It allows me to kind of, like, let a little bit of my walls down with you. That's -- Exactly. Sorry for doubting you. [ Laughs ] I'll forgive you. I do feel like I'm back in the race, and that's all I want. All I wanted was another chance to prove to Katie that I can be the guy for her. How are you feeling? I don't know. I had, like, mixed feelings after the reveal. I don't really want to win by default, because I don't want you to make a decision on who you want to be with based off of status. Yeah. I really don't. We have our own connection, and regardless of, like, the reveal last night, our connection is very unexpected in, like, the best way. And I hope you know that. Yeah. Obviously, my connection with Vince is very strong. But I do have to wonder, is he too good to be true? Like, how real is it when it comes to him and I? Are you in love with love or are you in love with me? So -- Oh, shoot, look who it is. Hey, guys. What's up, Benny? Can I talk to her for a sec? I'm-a need a minute. Nah, I'm just playing. I was trying to pull your line on me. I need all the minutes I can get, big dog. Go for it. Katie: Alright. Well, thanks for chatting. All righty. ♪♪ Hey. Hi. I'm really sorry about last night. I'm being so honest right now. I'm actually having, like, a very good time, like, being with everybody. I don't know that I'm wanting to kind of ruin that at the moment. I think we could probably chat a little bit later, if that's OK. I can't let any opportunities slip away. Well, then I'm going to tell you we will just chat later. OK. ♪♪ Oh. ♪♪ F-boy, f-bye. ♪♪ [ Up-tempo music plays ] Hali: OK. I brought the three of you on a carnival-themed date. We have, like, warm up games over here. Man: OK. Yay! OK. Any of y'all know how to play fish ball? I have always wanted to go on a carnival date, but I'm not gonna lie, finding out that all three of my guys are f-boys was very tough. I don't know which of them, if any, that I can trust. And there is money on the line now. They have the power to take everything for themselves. So going into this date, I'm pushing past my anger and hurt and deciding which one of them I can trust because they're definitely not gonna play with me. Pie the F-boy -- I figure it's self-explanatory. Who wants to go first? [ Men laughing ] It's almost like I'm walking into a lion's den. We're all f-boys, so I know she's not in the best mood. How many siblings do I have? You have three. I don't. 4. Alright, next? [ Laughs ] Whipped cream looks good on you, honey. When's my birthday? March 12th. Ooh. Wrong answer. [ Laughter ] It was March 12th, but he deserved it. Oh, my God! What's my favorite color? Pink. Ooh! It's black. Oh! [ Laughs ] It feels good to pie the guys. They deserve it, for sure. I feel a little bit more satisfied. Let's be real -- it's only us three left as nice guys. Hali has three f-boys. Based on Hali's reactions last night, she just seemed like she was fed up. At that point, I don't even know if I'd want to be here. There's $100,000 at the finish line, and all these guys going after her are f-boys. Even if they say they're reformed or whatever or now they're nice or whatever it is -- They may take that money. They may take the $100,000. She has, like, no safe space. Yeah, no. There's no one. I mean, if I was her, like, I would even consider leaving right now. What's the point of trying to further these connections and you're just risking heartbreak? They're not looking out for the best interests of Hali. All they're focused on is trying to survive and inch their way closer and closer to the $100,000. I was so good on that last one. Yeah, that was perfect. That hit me right in the face. It was really good. It was fun for me, but I know it was probably not fun for y'all, so. I'm a little sticky. Yeah. Obviously, we know that three of you are f-boys. Yes. So I just want to thank you for making me look like a [bleep] idiot. I appreciate it. I really do. And I don't know if y'all wanted to say anything. I definitely want to apologize. We didn't make you look too, you know, good last night. Obviously, that wasn't my intention. I'm really a great guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a great man. I'm a great person. I don't want it to reflect on my character as a man. I think I have been honest with you. And I'm trying to be better every single day. I had a past and, you know, there's certain reasons why that label is on me. I didn't try to deceive you in any way, and I'm truly so sorry. I am someone who went through so much adversity. When I met you, things changed. Definitely just happy to be here with you right now. Hali: The guys are saying the same thing. There's just a lot of talking. Word vomit. I'm not buying it. Some guys are just really good at playing the game. Obviously, I still have a lot to, you know, figure out so you guys can follow me this way. No more pies, I promise. [ Boys sigh ] I was about to say that's not a pie, it's a cake. -Oh, we got a merry go round. -Does this thing work? I haven't been on one of these in, like, 20 years, so. Hali: I've never been on one. Man: Never? Never. ♪♪ Oh, [bleep]. Oh, my God. Man: Wow. I'm surprised it still works. Oh my God. I know when coming on the island, you make a decision, like, "I'm here as an f-boy. I want to take the money." I feel like when you come here with that mindset, there's a certain intention that you have. And to me, they're not good intentions for someone that wants to leave with someone that I can trust. I'm too damn big for this thing, bro. [ Laughs ] This [bleep] idea was -- This is psycho. This has been the most embarrassing date. Hali: Good. You deserve it. [ Sighs ] Oh, wow. ♪ I'll be the pretty one in green ♪ ♪ These other girls, they dress like me ♪ As you all know, I'm a content creator, brand ambassador. ♪♪ I'm constantly shooting. I'm posting on Instagram. That is a full time job. So today, I'm gonna have the boys do a seasonal photoshoot to see what the boys are made of and if they can handle it or not. So one of you will model, one is gonna be behind the camera, and the other one is gonna be my assistant, and we'll switch off as we go. You know, I bring a lot of sunlight to life, a lot of energy. That's it? That's all we got for props? Christian, really? Oh, OK. Oh, you want more? You want more? They need sunglasses. Come on now, Christian. Come on. This is kind of spring. Jared: I'm really excited for this triple date right now. The money is getting a little bit closer and closer. I can almost smell it. I feel like my personality and my energy is really gonna surpass C.J. and Christian in this, and I know that they see me as a threat. This is a competition, and we're down to the final stretch. And you know, some people break and some people shine. ♪ Someone always gotta to take the lead ♪ Big smiles now. Good. There it is. [ Camera shutter clicking ] ♪ You got the message yet? ♪ Christian, chin up. Chin up. Big smile. Now give me a little bit more. You're very stagnant. Alright. Christian, look at her, you know. Look at her. Feel it. Have fun. It's fall. Natural. Am I looking at the camera or looking at her? Maybe touch her leg. You seem like you're scared of her. OK. Don't be scared. ♪ That girl ain't the only one breaking the bank ♪ ♪ I got a lot of green ♪ Let's stand back up. Let's stand back up. He's like, perfect. That was cute. Christian's like, get me the [bleep] out of here. Daniella: I was hoping this would get Christian to break out of his shell. It didn't. I'm worried if it's just not in him. Right now, I'm definitely backtracking with Christian. He's the last nice guy I have, and it's scaring me. Christian? Yep. You know the angle? Christian: There you go. ♪ Can't do it like me, can't do it like me ♪ ♪ No, no, la, la, la ♪ ♪ Can't do it like me, can't do it like me ♪ Alright, good. Good, good. Take notes, guys. Take notes. C.J. is killing it right now. ♪♪ C.J.: I feel as if the stakes are very high and I could be facing my fate tonight. So I'm-a put my best foot forward, because this is not the end of our love story. We need to continue writing another chapter. I thought you were going to go in for the kiss and you didn't. ♪♪ I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable if I was doing that in front of them two. I didn't know if it would make you feel awkward. Oh, OK. Well, thank you. I don't know. I do still feel like there's something with you that I adore. Because every time we're together, we, like, have the most fun. Yeah. When I'm around you, like, I just want to fully embrace my time with you. So it doesn't matter what I'm doing. I could be jumping off a mountain or something. I feel like if I said, like, let's go do that, you would do it. Christian. Cheers to top three, my guy. Top three. Yes, sir. I mean, I feel like I barely know you. You know, I feel the same way about you. What?! I feel like I barely know you. It's because you don't talk. What you be doing for fun, bro? ♪♪ Man... ♪♪ Just work out. Eat some wings. Hang out. Talk. Yeah, man, that's pretty much me. With Daniella and Christian, I don't know what the hell they talk about or what they do on these dates because he's boring as hell. Yes, I came in as a f-boy, but I won't be leaving here as a f-boy. That's why you're still here? Good stuff. Thank you. ♪♪ I went into our date today really thinking in my mind C.J. was going home. [ Sighs ] Every time I'm with him, he changes my mind. I want to share my life and what I built with someone who can measure up with me, travel with me, do these things with me. Yeah. And I feel like today, at least for me, I showed myself outside of the island. And we know Christian. This is not his comfort zone. No, not at all. He's a very private dude. He doesn't talk a lot. Someone once told me only boring people get bored. It is what you make it. You bring life to it. Yeah. Which is what I need. I need someone who can keep up. And that's a very small portion of what I do. Exactly. Hey. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. But I believe it's my turn. Nah. [ Laughs ] No, I'm playing with you. Sorry. Thanks, Jared. For sure. Come on in, Christian. Daniella: I have genuine feelings for all three of these guys, but my fear with Christian is that I can't break him out of his shell enough when he's with me. And to move forward, I need that from him. I'm like, begging him. Today was interesting. I was kind of skeptical, you know, of the three-man date kind of thing. But... I figured. I love our time together, you know that. But there is something missing. I know you're a nice guy. You revealed you're a nice guy. I don't need that anymore. I need Christian. That's literally all I need. Yeah. Hearing Daniella say that I'm not aggressive enough really makes me want to show her that side of me before going into elimination. I'm a man of action, so if Daniella wants to see me be more playful, I'm gonna do it right now. Um... ♪♪ So you're saying one more date and you'll show me that side? OK. I need a guy to just be able to have fun in any situation with me. Two guys showed today that they can. Christian, he is just still not stepping up to the plate. ♪♪ ♪ I'm so fabulous, I break all the rules ♪ ♪ I'm so fabulous, look at me, check my jewels ♪ ♪ I'm so fabulous, I ain't got time for you ♪ ♪ I'm so fabulous, even the mirror thinks so ♪ [ Sighs ] Oh, God. This is gonna be the elimination from hell. Yeah, it is. Hi, girls. Girls: Hi. How's it going? You look beautiful. Thank you. Likewise. How are we feeling ahead of tonight's penultimate elimination? Getting it down to your top two guys. I had a date with my three f-boys. Yeah. And they all gave me their excuse as to why they're an f-boy and why I should trust them. None of them really hit home for me, so I'm not sure. So it's totally up in the air who's going home for you? It's completely in the air. Because they're all tied at this point? In last place? Yeah. Right. [ Laughs ] Everyone's in last place. For me, I was so ready the last time we talked. Yeah. And now I'm really, like, last minute trying to figure this out tonight. It's a big one. Katie, what are you feeling? You know, this whole time, I thought the f-boy title wouldn't make a difference for me, but it has. And now that I know that Marco is a nice guy, there is a part of me that has felt like my walls coming down and being, like, more open and trusting to him as a person. It's Benedict versus Marco tonight. Yes. I don't know how you girls do it, but you're going to have to do it. The mixer is starting now, and then we're going to eliminate three men. The end is in sight. So good luck tonight. Hope you get the answers you need. I'll see you at the end of the mixer. Girls: Thank you. Good luck. Bye, guys. Woman: Bring on the men. ♪♪ -Let them in. -Oh, here they come. Hello. Well, well, well. Hey. How are you doing? Good. Sorry. Do you know my friend Mercedes? I do. I think it's his birthday. It is. What are we doing? Man: Hali, get those birthday licks in. Katie: I'll be very honest -- this dress is really [bleep] tight. Yeah? [ Laughs ] It looks great. It doesn't look comfortable. Thank you. You want to take it off of me? [ Laughs ] That's my style, I guess. Hali: I just want to understand. Yeah, come on. I feel like who you are showing up as doesn't seem authentic to me. OK. I get to where you don't trust people. And you kind of shouldn't, because there are people here who may be playing a game. I'm not playing a game. I came here with my heart. My heart's open, and my heart wants you. Then why did you come here as an f-boy if your heart is open? Because I'm a reformed f-boy. I'm not buying that, "Oh, I met you and my life changed." I think Mercedes says what he thinks sounds good and what he thinks you want to hear. I would never do anything to hurt you. And, you know, I can guarantee you that. If there was one girl that could make me hang up my f-boy Jersey, it would be Hali. And you know, I can't wait to leave this island with her. I'm not here for the money anymore. I want Hali. Daniella: Today, Jared comes up and talks to me, and he's like, "What is it with you and Christian? Because, like -- What do you guys talk about?" This is out of Jared's mouth. He's like, "He's boring." And I'm like... He said that? Yeah. Wait, so Jared said I was boring. Like, how did you all get on that? He knows my personality and he's not wrong with some things. And he was just like, I just want to know, what is it with Christian? Because he's like, you need someone who's gonna keep you on your toes. Adventurous, like, take charge. Christian: I'm not up here to be a stand up comedian. I'm here to look for a solid connection. And if she wants to see that, I can show her that side. But at the same time, I ain't no puppet. I don't want to keep... asking. I don't want to keep prying it out of you. I want you to feel comfortable enough with me. I want to see that, to move forward with you. You will see that. But I need it. I understand. E.J.: At the end of the day, we want what's best for the girls. I don't care if it's you. I don't care if it's me. It can't be Cedes. You feel me? Mercedes is not a good human being. I just think he's playing the game because he knows how to play, and it's working for him. So I'm nervous about tonight, man. It's the final three. He played this game before. He knows what he's doing. Yeah, he has the blueprint. He has the blueprint. Hali: What? It's my birthday. I know it's your birthday. [ Laughs ] I'm waiting on a gift. OK. Come. ♪♪ Evander: I don't think he has the right intentions here. And I've held my tongue for a while. E.J.: A long time. But we're in a totally different situation. Mercedes is so inconsistent. I think he's a liar, and I feel like he's lied so much to the point where he just believes his own lies at this point. She gotta know. Are you gonna tell her, like, now or wait? Hell, 100%. Hell yeah. I don't know if I can move forward with an f-boy. I don't date f-boys. I know you have high standards and you hold yourself to those morals and standards, which is something that I'm also looking for. Katie: I have Marco, who is here as a nice guy. And then I have Benedict, who is a f-boy. And as much as I thought the title wouldn't impact me, it has. Knowing that you're a nice guy has allowed me to just be like, I want you to stay. I want to keep getting to know you. Like, it just feels like a safe space. I have feelings for you, and I really, genuinely want to keep pursuing that. If you give me the time. Yeah. ♪♪ Christian: Hey, young Jared, let me holla at you real quick. So I just want to talk to you real quick. Because Daniella did mention about how you said, "How is your relationship with Christian? Because he's boring." She said that I said that? Yeah. Hm. I didn't say that. I said that you're more private, into yourself. And whether she finds that as boring, that's on her. So you're saying she's saying I'm boring. I'm not gonna put words in her mouth. I don't know what she said to you. Christian is definitely shook right now with me calling him boring, but compared to me, he's boring. My opinion on you doesn't matter. Daniella's does. That's true. So... That's all that matters. That's all that matters. Alright, brother. Alright. [ Laughs ] [ Up-tempo music plays ] ♪♪ Oh, Lord, C.J., give me something from the heart. Just give it to me. We're limited on time here. We can make this work. I mean, I can see it. I want to be 1% better every single day for her, for us. And I'm gonna leave it out there all on the line as if this is the championship game. I'm not trying to just sell you something. Like, this is actually, like, truly what I can see. You want an adventurous life. You want to travel. It's more of an upbeat, you know, kind of lifestyle, and I can hang with that. And I just feel as if one day, we will be a power couple. This is the first time since we've been here on the island together that it doesn't sound like he's reading from a book. It's coming from the heart. It's straight from C.J.. No matter what happens, you know I want what's best for you as well. ♪♪ Thank you. I have a lot, a lot to think about. I really don't know what to do tonight, and I'm just... ♪♪ I can't do nothing but be transparent with you and be honest with you. And you want me to be real with you, right? Please. I'm not gonna throw Mercedes under the bus, but I'm gonna give him a light push. Mercedes sees things differently about life. In what way? Like a very selfish way. He doesn't care about anyone. I just think he's been here before. He knows the routine. He knows how to deceive people. He knows this game, and you can't trust it. He's won the money before. I think he's here to win the money again. He understands the assignment. To come back and secure the 100k. Elijah and Evander came to me, trying to convince me not to choose Mercedes. Though I appreciate the information that they gave me, they didn't say anything new or anything that I wasn't concerned about myself. But is elimination night. You know, scary night. Scary time. So if there's any questions that you have with me, literally anything. OK. So question. Mm-hmm. Who would you say is the best fit for me and why? It's me. You've already said that you want someone who can match where you are. I just feel like me and you hit all criteria. And of course, I'm not gonna knock Christian. I'm not gonna knock C.J. They're great dudes. We're just all different. You did say Christian was boring. I say Christian was shy and reserved to himself. If he's boring, if that's what you think, I don't think that's what you're looking for. Great answer. I loved it. Thank you. Of course. Wanna get another one? Sure, I would love one. You can go grab one. Yeah. ♪♪ I'm not even gonna lie, but -- Chat done? C.J.: No, no, no. Man: What's up, boss? Can I get a tequila OJ for Daniella? Tequila OJ? Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Oh. Swoop in, swoop in. -Uh-oh. Hey. Sorry. Wait, hold on. What happened? Nothing. They just doing -- Just wanted to stop in real quick and just say I'm not boring, and Jared's a liar. Alright. I'm out. ♪♪ What the hell happened? Oh. [ Sighs ] Can we be cool again? What do you mean? I don't know. I miss us. [ Scoffs ] I'm just gonna be, like, so straight up. Please. You being an f-boy, it has, like, tainted a lot of things that we've experienced together, and I hate that so [bleep] much. Katie: Benedict revealed he's an f-boy. There's a lot of doubt planted in my heart when it comes to him. You can't start a relationship on this foundation of doubt. Everything that we experienced before that reveal, those are real feelings. I'm gonna do anything I can to leave with you. Like, I'm like... ♪♪ ...trying not to cry because you could go home tonight. Like, I just wish you weren't here as an f-boy. Like, I just don't know if it's something I can get over. What me and Katie had was special, and I don't want it to end tonight. It can't. You know, I can change this whole thing around with trust. With time, we could figure it out, but there's not time here. -OK. Oh my God. -No! Sorry. I mean, it's not over. There's still time on the island. Katie. I hear you. I'll be there in a sec. Follow your heart. ♪♪ Are you okay? No, I'm not. -Aww. -It's hard. This one's gonna be such a hard one. You'll be fine. You can do it, though. Thanks, girl. Let's go. Thank you. ♪♪ Good evening, nice guys and f-boys. Welcome to the most important elimination in television history. Until next week, when I say the exact same thing again. But three of you won't be here for that, so I just thought I'd say it so you felt special. Thanks. OK, let's get to the chopping block. Tonight, the women will be selecting their top two finalists -- the two they could potentially see a relationship with. Gentlemen, please step forward. ♪♪ We'll start with Daniella's guys. Christian, why do you deserve to be in Daniella's final two? Being a nice guy, some people take that as maybe I'm boring. But what I don't think is boring is coming home to you every night, not cheating. And also what's not boring, I'm here for you. How's that for boring? Nikki: Thank you, Christian. Jared. Daniella, ever since I got to the island and we met, we had a genuine connection from the very first mixer, the very first night that we talked, and that's what makes it so organic and authentic. Thank you, Jared. C.J., why do you deserve to be in Daniella's final two? Daniella, our relationship has truly been battle tested, and you make me want to be a better man for you every single day. I just want to be your double black diamond. Thank you, C.J.. Let's move on to Hali's guys. E.J., why do you deserve to be in Hali's final two? Hali, you showed me how I can be as a man, how I can really grow up, how I can really look into the future. I'll put my neck out there for you. Thanks, E.J.. Now let's hear from Evander. Hali, you're such a strong woman, and that's what I needed in my life. I'm such a different person from my past. I'm here for the right reasons. I'm truly a good guy. And I know it may look like I'm incomplete, but I feel like with you, you will make me complete. Thank you, Evander. Alright, Mercedes, why do you deserve to be in Hali's final two? Hali, ever since I come in here, I've had less time than these guys, and I built a stronger connection, and that should speak volumes to you. I've only worried about what you want and what you need in a man, and I know that's me. And I just want the opportunity to show you that. Thank you, Mercedes. Let's move on to Katie's guys. Marco, why do you deserve to be in Katie's final two? Katie, you have three great men right here -- two nice guys and one f-boy -- and I don't want to point trophies... [ Laughter ] All I'm saying is that he could take the 100 grand, and I can't because I'm a nice guy. Vince, why do you deserve to be in Katie's final two? Katie, it's been absolutely amazing. Every laugh, every tear we've shed -- these are all memories that I'm gonna cherish forever. And one last thing. I just want the world to know that I... am in love with Katie. [Bleep]. Wow. Wow. Benedict: If you put bread in a toaster and press the lever down, Vince falls in love quicker than when it becomes toast. Benedict, why do you deserve to be in Katie's final two? Katie, look, I regret coming here as an f-boy, and I'm telling you, I'm gonna prove to you that I am a nice guy inside. And I know I've been saying that, but I'm already changing. I told you, I'm falling for you. I see you as my girlfriend. And that's how I picture us off of the island together. Our future is bright, and I don't want that flame to burn out anytime soon. ♪♪ Thank you, Benedict. Ladies, after hearing all of that, do you feel confident in the decisions that you need to make tonight? No. It's time to make that decision. Daniella, who will be the first person who is safe tonight? I'm just really going off my gut right now. ♪♪ The first person... is Jared. ♪♪ Jared, you're safe. You're one of Daniella's finalists. Am I gonna leave this island with Daniella? If I want to.

I don't know which one of you I can trust. I'm just trying to trust myself and hoping for the best. So the first boy that I'm picking is E.J.. ♪♪ You're safe. Have a seat. And Hali, who is the second boy who is safe tonight? The second guy that is safe tonight... is Mercedes. ♪♪ Mercedes, have a seat. ♪♪ Katie, who is the first person who is safe tonight? Vince. Vince, you know what to do. ♪♪ Katie, who will be joining Vince in your final two? ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Coughing ] ♪♪ Dude... ♪♪ I think better Benedict and I could have had a normal experience had he been a nice guy. I think you just gotta go with your gut on this one. Tonight, we have assembled for The Mansplain. You're gonna tell them everything they need to know and reveal all the juicy secrets they neglected to tell us back before when we remembered their names. Mansplain could switch up this entire game. He said he was "the best to ever play the game." Christian may be a nice guy, but I think that's just because 50K is more than his salary. Somebody had to say it. I don't think he matches up to you.
