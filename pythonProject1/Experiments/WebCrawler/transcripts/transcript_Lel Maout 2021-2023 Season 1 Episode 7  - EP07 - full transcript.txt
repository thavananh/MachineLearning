Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- Let's run away! -What? -Let's run away from the orphanage. Run away? Yes, run away. It's a deal. Deal. EPISODE 7 When did you wake up, darling? I didn't realize that you had. I woke up early, at 6:00. And why so early? I don't know, I couldn't sleep anymore. By the way, have you seen Basil today? No, not yet. It seems he stayed late with Sahar yesterday. Why are you all dressed up? Where are you going? I have an appointment with the dentist. Do you want to have lunch with me later? Not today, I'll be back very late, darling, I have a lot of work. Have I told you that I love you? Today? -No -Yes. -No, I haven't heard that. -Indeed, I told you. All right, I am telling you now. -I love you. -How much? -A lot. -How much is a lot? More than you can imagine. I adore you. -Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. I wanted to clean the library, but the door wouldn't budge, it seems it is stuck. It is not stuck, I locked it with the key. Just a moment, ma'am. How can I clean the library when the door is not open? You can clean it whenever I am here. -Don't be late to pick me up. -Yes, okay. If you are, I will get in a big fight with you. I understand, I get it. -Be careful. -Okay. Get lost now, go! Incredible. God damn you, in this life and in the next. Good morning, Mrs. Reem. Welcome, Mr. Omar. Mr. Hadi is waiting for you. I made you the herbal tea that you like. So, daughter, do you feel better? Sahar. Do you know what the hardest thing about betrayal is? -What? -That it never comes from an enemy. Never in my life did I think that Reem would stab me in the back. I expected that from everybody except her. But in the end, it was her who struck me. You are right, Mom. She used to say that sheep spend their whole lives being afraid of wolves. But in the end, it's the shepherd who eats them. Reem hasn't deserted you and she hasn't stabbed you in the back. Actually, Reem just fell in love, she is deeply in love. Why don't you try to put yourself in her shoes? Why don't you fall in love too? I've tried, Hanane, I've tried. Especially after I met someone, I said, "Why not?" Maybe people like me have the right to love and to be loved. I've tried, I want to feel what she felt. And have you felt it? Yes, I felt... I felt weak. And I don't like to be weak. I don't like being broken. I swear to God, I am not fighting her. I am protecting her. I'm protecting her from herself. Especially after I met Basil. Perhaps I should have protected myself as well, I don't know. Sahar, my darling, stop thinking, stop it, live in the moment. Let yourself go, love Basil, and let him love you as well. You deserve to have a new life and to open a new chapter, just like Reem. Don't hold back your tears, let them out. Let them fall and feel better. Those who cry are not weak. But they have been strong for a long time. Let your tears fall and relax. Omar, there's something strange, something I cannot believe. What kind of a coincidence is this? Have you forgotten that I introduced them to each other? Of course it's a coincidence. Anyway, don't make a big deal out of it. I am sure that Sahar won't give him a chance. What do you mean by that? They spent the night out together yesterday. Really? -Is it possible that she likes him? -I don't know, Omar. I have to tell Basil, but at the same time, I can't tell him. He might mess things up and become attached to her, we don't need that. He's coming, let's change the subject. We have to think this over carefully. -Welcome. -Hey, Omar. -Darling. -You're here, why didn't you wait for me? Because you wouldn't wake up early. It's true, I slept like never before, and without a pill. It's seems that Sahar made a good impression on you. Yes, it seems so. -How was your night out yesterday? -Excellent. I was so happy, I didn't want the night to end. Finally, we get to see Basil in love. I am not in love, it's not that. But sometimes you come across somebody and you realize she has something that no one else in your life does. -And that made me comfortable. -That fast? Take your time, you still don't know her. What I do know is that she is my match, and that in itself is enough for me, and wherever it takes me, I will go. Basil, take your time, don't rush into this. What did you say? -Don't rush it. -Look who's talking. He says don't rush it. He fell in love and got married after two months. And now you are lecturing me? Do you want to do what he did? It's not that, I just want my feelings to carry me wherever they want. And wherever that gets me, there are no problems. I am fine with it. Hello? That's me. Welcome. Excellent, I'll be there right away. They registered the car, it's in my name now. -Where is your driver? -Outside, let him take you there. See you at work, bye. -Congratulations on the car. -Thank you. It seems he's already attracted to her, I don't know what you should do. It would be a dilemma if I tell him. And it's a bigger dilemma if I don't tell him. In a normal situation, you should have told him, but after everything he's been through... the shock would be hard on him and he couldn't take it. Sure. It's okay, Sahar. ...with the fate of the nuclear negotiations that are taking place in Vienna. -Good morning, Dad. -Good morning, darling, welcome. -Tell me, how do you feel today? -I am great, thank God. -And how about the machine, how is it? -Oh, it's so great. It is so smooth, unlike the old one. It used to annoy me because of the noise. Sure, because this is the newest model. How much? Was it expensive? Nothing is too expensive for you, Dad. ...in a meeting held by the ministers of foreign affairs in the European Union. -Good morning, my great lady. -Welcome, darling, I will make you coffee. No, I don't want to be late, I have a job interview. I prayed that God would bless you and make everything you do successful. I don't need to keep reminding you, Mom, my father's situation is very sensitive right now. -Don't leave him, even for one moment. -I know. But what should I do about work? I have to be there three days a week. No, you shouldn't go, and you know that I'm against that kind of work. This is not for you, Mom. -It's not a shame to work. -Yes, it is a shame. When your son is doing nothing, while you are cleaning offices, that is a shame. Mom. I put in the effort, I studied and I toiled, so I could carry the burden instead of you. -So, let me carry it. -But you did enough when you had a job. I will work again, but you must stop worrying, I beg you. You have to carry a lot. Take this, Mom, buy some groceries, the fridge is empty. When I come back, I will go to Abdallah and settle our debts. How are you going to pay your friend back? All this money, it's too much. You don't have to think about these things anymore. Let me carry the burden, please. But you don't need this, you already have enough on your plate. Don't worry, I can handle it. May God bless you and open doors for you. May God bless you. I don't need to remind you, Hanane, I don't want anyone to know that I was here. Especially Reem. I don't want her to know about anything we discussed. Yes, does that mean that I won't see you anymore? I don't know. Take care of yourself, darling. How are you, Mahmoud? -How are you, darling? -Thank God. How is your mom? Tell her I am making coffee and waiting for her. I will. Welcome, pretty girl. -You're here? -No, I am there. Can you tell me what you are trying to do? I don't know what you mean. Explain it to me. You know very well what I meant. Treat me as if I'm someone who isn't too clever. And explain it to me. Basil. How do you know Basil? Stop trying to fool me. How do I know Basil? He is my husband's brother. What? -Basil is Hadi's brother? -Oh, really? You are surprised, aren't you? Oh, now, I am very touched! Yes. Honestly, I am surprised. Enough, stop trying to outsmart me. Is this the war you were talking about, Sahar? You really think that I planned to meet Basil? Enough of your lying and pretending. We both know all too well that you didn't meet Basil by chance. You planned for this, Sahar, when things started to slip through your hands. Things don't slip from Sahar's hands, little girl! You know me well. And because I know you well, I am sure that Basil is one of your games. You know, I don't feel like doing this, Reem. I don't feel like justifying or defending myself. Out of my way. Make yourself comfortable, as if it were your own home. It's okay, Sahar. You wanted a war? You'll get a war! Yes, Reem. I know, I shouldn't be calling you. But I had to. Listen, Sahar came here to see me, she asked me not to tell you something, but I can't, I have to tell you. No, no, I can't tell you over the phone. When you have time, come visit me. Welcome, great lady. -So, what happened, Jaber? -Things are advancing, but a bit slowly. No, this is very slowly, and things are not good at all. The residents here are not easy to deal with. -Not everyone is willing to sell. -Money makes everything happen. Do you hear me, Jaber? Money makes everything happen. You only have one month to make me the owner of the whole neighborhood or else you know what I can do to you. Why am I dealing with that scumbag? And you, out of my way! -Rasheed. -What? I want two bunches of radishes. -The radishes are 3,000. -What? They used to be 1,500... -Good day, old man. -Oh, what a day. What do you want? -I am a man of good deeds! -Nothing good can come from you. I've told you a hundred times, don't come to see me. Who told you I am here to see you? I've come to see master Amine. Fifteen hundred? Fifteen hundred, my son? Hey, look at me, hey! Yes, it's 2,000. I told you, it's 2,000! Welcome, welcome. You honor my house, welcome. Coffee? No, I've come to talk business. We can talk business while drinking coffee. Lamees. -Lamees. -Yes, Father. Come, my darling. Make us some coffee, please. Hi, Uncle. Do you want your coffee with or without sugar? Very sweet, just like you. As you wish. Excuse me. It's unbelievable how fast life goes by. I can't believe your little, tiny daughter looks like that now. Isn't it amazing? It feels like only yesterday, she was playing in the street. Now she is a young woman. Not just a young woman, she is so pretty. God bless her. How old is she? -She is 17. -Is she a student? Sure, this is her last year. And you want her to go to university? I will make her an advocate, a big lawyer. I will send her to the government university, that won't cost me a lot. Don't do that, not even if they pay you. Be wise about it, Amine. Nowadays, if your daughter goes to university, you will lose her. The university girls are so astute nowadays. Listen to me, as soon as she finishes school, you should make her get married. The proverb says, "It's better to have a man in the house than to have many diplomas on the wall." I want to educate her, to marry her off to a rich man, not just any groom. You don't have to educate her, the groom is available. -Who? -Me! Why are you so quiet? -You don't approve of me? -No, you are a good fellow, but... -you have two wives already. -That's not a problem. I have the right to have four! -Where are you, Siham? -Here you are. Darling, you can rest in your room right now. Thank you. I want to know why Mrs. Reem locked the library with the key and has forbidden me to go in there unless she is around. Listen, Sariah, my heart is telling me something fishy is going on. Of course something's fishy. And it's all to do with the box she brought with her last time. Well done! You are right. But what could be in the box? I'll find out, even if it kills me. May God keep death away from you. We don't want you to die. -Come with me -Where to? Come with me. I want to search for the key to the library. Surely, she is hiding it in her room. -Are we going to search her room? -Yes, we're going to search her room. Why are you scared? There's no one here. What if Mr. Hadi or someone else shows up? So, Reem, why are you so quiet? It seems you don't believe what I told you? What? Surely this is not a coincidence. I can't believe that she doesn't know they are brothers. Surely, she doesn't. Take this, drink your coffee. I mean, for her to come here, to the neighborhood where all her bad memories are, and open up her heart and tell me everything... There's no better proof. I don't believe it. It is not possible that she has feelings for Basil. Sahar is not like that. Believe it, because at the end of the day all women are like that. They weaken in front of certain men. Except Sahar. Sahar does not wane. Sahar is strong. If you think that she is strong, you would be mistaken. Sahar is weak on the inside and she needs love even more than you do. Listen, Reem... Sahar wasn't lying to you, because I saw honesty in her eyes when she cried here, in front of me. The time has come for you to fulfil your promise to her. What do you mean? I mean I want you to help her to get closer to Basil, to let her love him. Let her start a new chapter. Right? Get in right now! Spare me this, please, Sariah, my heart is about to stop beating. Why are you afraid? There's no one in the house. -And what if they came back? -No, they never come back. Come on, now, this is getting on my nerves. -I will start searching. -Go ahead, search, get this over with. Also, let me say something. How is it our business if there is or there isn't a secret in the library? Now you say it's not your business? You were dying to know what is in the box. And now I am dying from fear, how about that? -Where are the closets? -Inside, come on, now! Get in and stop babbling. Come in. This isn't a closet, it's a fashion store. Yes. This is what rich people's closets are like. Oh, my God. -What is this? -Stop playing and get on with it. -Look at the bags! -Start searching. -How does she have time to carry them all? -I don't know. Mona, would she notice if I took one of the bags? -What? -If I take a bag. Are you being serious? -You want to steal a bag? -What do you mean, "steal"? Am I a thief? I'll just borrow it for a little while, I will brag about it in our neighborhood and bring it back. -No, put it back. -Did you search this one? Yes. Stop throwing these everywhere. What are these pills? -Why is she taking them? -What are they? -They are birth control pills. -What are you saying? -How do you know? Maybe they are... -"Microgynon," read it. "Microgynon." Um Salem, our neighbor, after she had all of her children, she used them every day. Sariah, are you sure that these are birth control pills? Am I stupid or what? What do you want? What's going on? What made you come back? Hanane told me that you visited her. Hanane has a loose tongue nowadays. -I asked her not to tell you. -But she told me. -She told me everything. -Leave me alone, Reem. I can't stand this. You really didn't know that Basil is Hadi's brother? Do you really have feelings for him? We're back to the same subject. No, I knew he was Hadi's brother, and I don't have feelings for him. And I'm playing with his emotions, and I am messing with him, are you happy? You can leave now. Do you really have feelings for him? This is the first time I've seen you like this. What's the use, even if I have feelings for him? What's the use, when he is Hadi's brother? You should go now and... I will talk to him and leave him. You won't leave him. Look at me. No, you won't leave him. You will stay with him and I am going to help you. How are you going to help me? I'll help you to be with him. You are crazy. Maybe. But all of your life you've been the one who thinks and plans. Let me handle that this time. Stop messing this up, Reem. We can't stretch it out any longer. -We will be exposed. -No, we won't be exposed. Everything will be how we want it to be. I can't believe that... That we will be living like a family and making our dreams come true. You've found the love of your life and I've found the love of my life. -All of us, one family, one house. -You are dreaming, Reem. People like us don't have the right to dream. Didn't you tell me that all of your dreams can come true? Take it easy for a little bit. We have the right to dream. Surely that's Basil. Go and don't worry, I will leave him. No, you won't leave him. When Hadi finds out I am dating his brother, he won't accept it. He will tell him. Hadi already knows. He saw you together and he hasn't told him yet. He won't tell him, because... Basil has a special condition. What do you mean, "a special condition"? Enough, Reem, I beg you to leave. No, I won't leave. Get yourself together and answer him. -Hello. -Where are you? -I am here, where are you? -You should congratulate me. I just got my car now. Congratulations. Where would you like me to take you out tonight? -Wherever you want. -Is 9:00 good for you? Yes, it's very good. -Are you okay? -Yes, I am very good. -But I have a headache. -I hope you feel better soon. Send me the address so I can pick you up from your house. Yes, sure. I feel like you'll make me want to bash my head against a wall. On the contrary... I will make you a member of the household, my household! I will call him when you are with him and I will invite you both to dinner. And, of course, you will accept the invitation. Let me handle things myself this time. Trust me. -Mona, do you like the flowers? -They're wonderful, very nice. I hope all your days will be as beautiful as these flowers. -Is there something that you want? -I... No, not at all. -I came to see if you want anything. -Yes. -Tell me. -One thing. Go to the kitchen and do your job. As you wish, ma'am. My darling. I am here. Babe... you are so beautiful. Do you like it? I like your beauty, and your posture, and your eyes. What can I do? I love you. But what's the occasion? We're having guests over for dinner. -Really? -Yes. Who are these guests? Your brother and Sahar. Where did you meet Sahar? I didn't, but I called your brother and she was with him. So I invited them both. Now, go up and take a bath. How come you made a decision without asking me? Why didn't you tell me that you invited guests over here? Darling, things just happened casually, don't make a big deal out of it. -Why are you nervous? -I am not. -Yes, you are... -No, I am not nervous yet. But I was supposed to know, right? You know, I just told you. Would you calm down? It's not a big deal. I want you to go up now and rest a little bit. Get dressed and put something nice on. For my sake. Next time, don't make a decision without asking me. Yes, Omar. Why did you leave so suddenly, without telling me about the bid? Never mind the bids now, Omar. I might be in big trouble. -Trouble? What is the matter? -Sahar. Sahar is coming to have dinner here. He wants to introduce her to you so fast? What am I going to do? I swear to God, I don't know what to do. Surely she will know that Basil is my brother and she will tell him. So what's the problem if she told him? Until now... Your brother Basil doesn't know that you know her, he doesn't even know you've met her. So you haven't kept anything from him, calm down. I hadn't thought of that. But whether she told him or not, I am in big trouble. It seems you can't be left alone, I am coming right away. -Okay, come over. -Bye, now. Excuse me, Mrs. Fifi, sorry to bother you. Would you like me to bring you anything? A glass of whiskey? Do you want me to massage you? -Just give me your order... -Please. What is it with you? You should have been outside an hour ago, heating up the customers. And yet you are here. Go and see the bustle outside and the customers crammed in the place. What are you doing here? What? Speak up! -Answer me! -Isn't my client coming today? -What client do you mean? -The same one. The regular client who always comes to be with me. -Omar -Ah, Omar, I don't know. -So, you're waiting for him? -No, I am not, but the thing is... The thing is what? Say it! What is the situation between you two? Tell me, I'm afraid you're starting to miss him and you're hooked on him. Tell me! Yvonne, why would I do that? You know his story. As if he can do anything! -I will be out in five minutes. -One minute! Do you understand? Darling, you should look beautiful. Powder your pretty face, because it is greasy! I feel like you are tense. Because I really am. My brother and his wife are not scary. I know. But I don't like that things happened so suddenly. You didn't give me time to prepare myself. But it's not my fault, you heard what Reem said over the phone. And you agreed to it. I couldn't say no. If you're uncomfortable, let's just apologize to them. I don't want to embarrass you. What do you say? -You're not ready yet? -I'm ready now. Mr. Basil and his guest are here, they are in the hall. -We're coming down. -Go ahead, I will come later. -Don't be late. -Okay. Don't get nervous, okay? There's nothing to be afraid of. This is Reem, my brother's wife. -Welcome, Sahar. -Thank you for having me. Thank you for accepting my invitation. You know, this is the first time that Basil has introduced us to a girl that he likes. -That's the first I've heard of this. -Must you expose me right away? -Your eyes are exposing you, actually. -Is that so? -Ask Sahar. -What do you think, Sahar? I'd say that the house is very nice, you have wonderful taste, ma'am. You are so kind. She can change the subject faster than anyone in the world. -Where is the big boss? -Coming down in a minute. Please, sit down. There he is. My darling. My brother, Hadi, and this is Sahar. Good evening, miss. Good evening. Her name is Sahar, darling. Why are you being so formal? Welcome, Sahar, please, come in. Come in, come in, Sahar. Take it easy, darling. Okay? I told you from the beginning. Mona. Who might that be, darling? I don't know. -What do you do, Sahar? -Sahar is an interior designer. She takes houses that are in ruins and she turns them into slices of heaven. She has talent. What brings you here, Omar? -Good evening, folks. -Welcome. You arranged to get together without me? I invited myself to dinner when I learnt that you were here. -You're right. -You are in your house. I have no doubt. How are you, my friend? Thank God, Omar. I am very well. Do you know each other? Yes, I'm the one that introduced Basil to Sahar. It seems you're not just a good omen for me and Hadi, but for Basil and Sahar too. Yes, I swear, it's true, everyone should have a friend like Omar. I am embarrassed. What kind of wine would you like to have, Sahar? I'll serve it gladly, please. Let's have our dinner, please. -All right. -Come in, please. Excuse me, I will bring the wine. And I will wash my hands. What are you doing here? How long will you keep running away from me? I love you and desire you. I adore you. I adore you.
