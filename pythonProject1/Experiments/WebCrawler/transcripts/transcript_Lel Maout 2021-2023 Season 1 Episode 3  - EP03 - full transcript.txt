Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- Do you need anything? Has anything happened to you? Tell me, dear. Do you need anything? -What happened? -Do you need anything? It seems like nobody cares about her! Who is responsible for this girl? Who is it? EPISODE 3 What are you doing here? I told you, I needed a few days to think and... I did. Bravo! Bravo! I missed you. It seems like you didn't miss me and you haven't been thinking about me. Listen to me. You're not a normal person, you're a crazy woman. Yesterday, you were talking about divorce and now you come here to tell me you missed me? What has gotten into you? -I didn't just miss you, I love you and... -Enough! Stop saying that you love me! I have been living with a dead woman for three months now! A stranger! I'm living with your shadow! I called you to hear you say it over the phone. And what did you do? You shut up. I came here to tell you, face to face. Really? -I love you. -I love you, I love you! Why are you doing this, Reem? You're not saying anything. As usual you're silent and have no answer. Hello. Would you change your mind and let me come to you before we go out? So, you're not saying anything. That means you agree, right? No, I will come to you, I will. Just a minute. Where are you going? One of my employees brought me an envelope and I need to collect it from reception. Why isn't he coming up here? This is what I want. I like to go down. Do you mind? I was sure that you... I came back to find my wife in my room. Never call me or talk to me unless you tell me first. Never! Go inside. Thank you for agreeing to have dinner with me. I know that everything that's happened is so strange. And my coming here is even stranger, but... I did all this because I love you. I... I came here so we can start a new chapter. And go back to the life that we were living before. And go back to being the Reem who fell in love with you and who you fell in love with. And the past three months, what should we do about them? Throw them away? Yes, throw them away. You insist on beating around the bush. You're hiding things. You're still ambiguous. I still love you, that's the most important thing. I doubt it. You are right to doubt it. I... I haven't been myself lately. I feel like I don't know you. Thank you. I will tell you... I will tell you everything, but... first, let's have dinner. What do you say? I'm not hungry. Eat your dinner and enjoy it. I'll be waiting for you to finish our talk that isn't... over yet. Or maybe it hasn't started yet. Please go ahead and eat. Reem, tell me. What is happening to you? Why did you come here? What is happening to you? If we're going to start a new chapter, I need to understand. You have no answer. I know you don't have one. I'm going to the bathroom. In the meantime, perhaps you can gather your thoughts. Then you might be able to answer my questions. Excuse me. Your wife is pretty. Thank you. I have an important question and I want you to answer it. When you were sitting with her just now, did you want to be with me? The woman you're talking about is my wife. I know. But that wasn't my question. I think I got the answer. Excuse me, do you have a lighter? Sure. You know, I used to have the same lighter, but I gave it to someone. -Please keep it. -That's very kind. So? Have you thought about it? You have nothing to say. As usual. As usual. I'm going up to my room to sleep because I'm very tired. Eat and enjoy, and charge it to my room. Move it a little bit. Add two more, it's okay. Even if the cost is higher, I will take care of that. Mrs. Sariah, Mrs. Sariah! Why are you going to work on foot, darling? If Amine can't take you, I will gladly take you in my van. Are you bribing me with two cans of tuna and sardines, Abdallah? God forbid! You are much higher valued, my darling! I want to apologize for what happened. Your apology is not accepted. Mrs. Sariah, we've known each other forever. Would you upset an old man like me? It's the old man who upset this young woman. Forgive me, young woman, you have such a big heart. My heart is not big, it's nothing like that. -That means... -Yes, I'll forgive you on one condition. -What? -You deduct some money from my debt. -But I am... -By the way, your vegetables are so expensive. Go and check the prices at Abou Mustafa's shop. They're all buying from him, except me. I am still buying from you because I want you to make a living. I know that, but you also know that the dollar is going up and at the same time, the lira is going deep underground. But I'll do this gladly, I am ready to do anything you want. But at least give me a small payment. Yes, as you wish, I will give it to you on Thursday, if not, on Monday. Okay, that's fine. The one who works for you doesn't seem to understand. Hey, you! Curly-haired guy, look at me! Those eyes of yours, if they look towards our balcony again, I swear it, I will pull your hair out and wipe the floor with it! Sariah, don't cause problems this early in the morning, go to work. Enough, Nadia, take care of your business and leave them alone. -What? Her extreme behavior is not good. -Enough, Nadia, already! -God bless you. -Bless you too. -Add this to my account. -No, it's for free, come on! Hey, show me your smile. Yes, let her cry, but you must be happy, leave her be. We're all by your side. Come on, laugh, now, laugh! -Where are you going? -I have a meeting. -Till when? -I don't know. Are you coming back to the hotel right after that? Why are you asking me more and more questions? I am your wife! It's my right to ask my husband where he is going and what time he will be back. It's good you remember that I am your husband. I never forgot that you're my husband. It seems you've forgotten that I'm your wife. Yes, I did! Because you made me forget. Hadi, listen to me, believe me, I'm trying... Believe you? I'm trying to believe you. I'm trying, but I can't. Bye. You see? Even though you're married, you can't help but think about me. What happened between us was very beautiful. We both wanted it, I am not denying that. But it shouldn't happen again. But I can't help myself. Can you? Sahar, Sahar, I am sorry. But we must forget what happened between us. Just like that? Forget everything? Are you ending everything between us with just a couple of words? We should talk. We will talk, but don't forget that my wife is here. -Then let's meet outside. -I can't, I have a meeting right now. I shall see you in the evening. Hadi, we should talk. It's my right to ask for that, isn't it? Is it my right or is it not? -It's your right, but... -Let's meet tonight at Mobash Restaurant. I'll be waiting for you at 9:00, don't be late. How are you, Siham? -Where is Basil? -Down there. -Welcome. -What a nice surprise. How did you know I was here? I was just talking to your brother, he told me. Have a seat. -Siham, bring Omar some breakfast. -No, don't bother, I already ate. -I had some meat pies. -Hope you enjoyed them. Tell me, you've been here for some time now, why didn't you call me? I wanted to call you today, I swear. -And you're staying for how long? -Forever. And I'm staying around you. Finally, your brother has been nagging for some time now, he wanted you to come and work with him. I haven't decided about work yet, I still have to think it over. Think about it twice and then decide to work with your brother. Hadi needs you. He's not concentrating on his work lately because of all the problems with his wife. By the way, where is she? She's not here, she went to see him. -Really? When? -Yesterday. What happened between them? Did you ask Hadi about it? Because he wouldn't give me any details. All the problems are in her head, man! Your brother doesn't understand her. He doesn't understand what she wants. She's not an easy person to understand. I personally do not feel comfortable around her. It doesn't matter if you're not comfortable. It's Hadi's comfort that matters. He is neither comfortable with her, nor around her. Every day he comes to work so tense that he is not able to work. I don't know, she's occupying his mind. He loves her. What kind of love is behind such a quick marriage? Maybe you're saying that because you haven't really been in love. Actually, I fell in love, and I was in love, but it didn't make a fool out of me. Just watch, they will make up tomorrow. Then she'll be back making his life miserable. It's obvious that you can't stand her. She means nothing to me, I only care about your brother. I only wish him the best. Since you do, pray that he makes things work with her. If I do, I wouldn't be wishing him well, my friend. What is it with you, Omar? What's your problem with Reem? My problem is that she doesn't treat your brother well. Isn't that enough? "Your coming here, madam, won't change anything at all." "Don't bother. Your husband doesn't love you." "At 9:00, he will be having dinner with me at Mobash Restaurant." "It's right behind the hotel if you'd like to see for yourself." -Won't you cancel your meeting? -I can't cancel my meeting. I booked a table for us. Please, Hadi, for my sake. You did, so what? Why is that a problem? I told you I have a meeting. Next time. Don't you want to know what's wrong with me? Please, Hadi, cancel the dinner. I will tell you everything. And you won't tell me unless I cancel my meeting? You know what? I don't want you to tell me anymore. I don't even care about it in the first place. Yes, it matters to you, I am your wife, your wife! -Tell me that you love me. -Calm down. -Tell me you love me. -Calm down, don't get nervous. Tell me you love me! Tell me you love me! Calm down! Calm down. Lower your voice. Tell me that you love me. You're abnormal! I don't recognize you. What is happening with you? What is happening with you? Tell me who you are! Who are you? I am your wife, who adores you. Please don't go. Please don't leave. Please cancel your meeting. I am sorry. We can't go to the restaurant together. -Surely you're not serious. -I am dead serious. -Are you being serious? -I have to go out with my wife. That's why I'm apologizing to you. Actually, I am the one who should apologize. Because you have to go out with me tonight. And I will solve the issue with your wife. Leave it to me! Hey, where are you going? What are you doing? Crazy woman! I told you, either I solve this issue with your wife, or you solve it in your own way. What's it going to be? With me or with her? And I am telling you that I'm more important than your work. You've waited three months to tell me, you can wait a few more hours. So you want to leave? Go, then. But I swear, if you go, you won't find me when you come back, not here or in Beirut. By the way, everything can't go your way whenever you want it to. Hey, man! You've come too far to order a glass of water and play Candy Crush on your phone. Put that away, let's talk a bit. Shall I order you a glass of milk? I told you I can't drink, I'm on medications. I hope you get better. -Cheers -Cheers. Did you talk to your brother today? I tried to call him, but he didn't answer. Did you talk to him? I want to know what happened between him and his wife. No, I didn't, and since he didn't call me, that means things with his wife are going well. Hopefully, that's what I want. Look, look at that girl over there. -Isn't she cute? -Not my type. What I want is to ask you about some girl and hear you say that she is your type. I really want to know what your type is. If she doesn't stir my heart, then she's not my style. Actually, your eyes are closed and you don't want to see. Look at me and my big eyes, I see beautiful women wherever I look. Let me see. -Indeed, like the eyes of a wolf! -The wolf is very nice. Cheers. Are you going to find your own house? Or will you be staying with your brother? I am not staying with him, for sure. I will find a house and I'll buy it. -Then leave it to me. -To you? What do you mean? I know a girl who is a real estate agent, very talented. But she is also a very pretty girl. Are you looking for a house or for a bride? I want to find you both, that would be the best. But I am... I mean... I doubt that she would look at you anyway, she didn't even look at me. And why would she? Don Juan. Now, let's talk seriously. This girl's had problems in her life. She was in love with a man and he loved her. And her parents didn't like him, so he killed himself. She was traumatized by it, so she took men and love off of her mind. -Cheers. -Cheers. I thought you weren't coming. You left me with no other choice. You were threatening to tell my wife. Do you really think that I would tell your wife? Do you think I'm crazy? Honestly, I don't know you. I don't know if you're crazy or not. No, you know me very well. Based on the past couple of days that we've spent together, you should know me by now. I have never been as real and clear with anyone. Then why did you threaten me? Why are you doing this? -Because we have to talk. -We have to talk. Then talk, please, I'm listening. But not before we eat, because I'm very hungry. Hungry? But I can't be late. Don't worry, we won't be late, because I already ordered food. I know what you like to eat. Sahar, we came here to talk. And you haven't said a word. You cannot do this to me. -I didn't do anything to you. -I know that. It's my mistake. The days we spent together were no mistake. And you were very pleased with me. You can't deny that. I'm not denying it. Yes, I was happy with you. But I am married, you know what married means. But you're not happy with your wife. Hadi, look at me. Sahar... My wife came here to fix all of our problems. What about me? What about what happened between us? -It shouldn't have happened. -But it did. You can't pretend it didn't happen. I have nothing more to say. I have nothing to say. Do you want to tell me or have you changed your mind? I can't have children. I found out three months ago. That is the reason I had to stay away from you. I was afraid to tell you, I thought you'd leave me. But right now, you are leaving me anyway. There is another reason that I didn't tell you. The pity that I see in your eyes right now. If you think that I would leave you for a thing like that, you are so wrong. And if you think that I'd allow you to stay with me out of pity, then you are wrong. I'm staying with you because I love you. And I want to live with you... and continue my life with you. Rasheed, what is the price of cauliflower today? -It's 4,500. -It was only 3,000 yesterday. Today the dollar is higher than yesterday. No, Mr. Abdallah, where are you? Come and say something. Talk to Master Abdallah. -Do we still have a date? -Yes, at 3:00. I will be waiting for you at 2:00. No, at 3:00, or I won't be able to concentrate. -I love you. -Bye. God damn them. The dollar is going up and we're going down. Listen, buy medicine with that money instead. -This is a gift from Abdallah. -Okay. And this is the biggest organic tomato! Oh, God! Good morning, Dad. Where would good things come from, Mahmoud? -Do you know what happened? -What happened? The government won't be supporting flour or medicine or gasoline anymore. I beg you, please, Father. Stop watching the news and stop getting upset. -You might suffer another seizure. -So what if I suffer another seizure? Let it happen, then I would die. Isn't that better? -Then I would rest in peace and you too. -Why are you saying this, Dad? Please, may God keep you through all this. -Did you have breakfast? -No. Your mother went to work very early, and I wasn't hungry. All right, I'll make two sandwiches and we'll have breakfast together. There is no solution, today, I'm saying it frankly, to achieve social justice. That is why we called this session a comprehensive national resolution, to justify the support, so that... the support should be distributed to those in need... achieving the principle of social justice. So in this session, let's... What is my darling doing outside in the cold? I'm thinking. About what? About us. -I love you. -I love you too. I won't let anything mess with our life. Nothing at all. On Friday, in parliament... And this is the best sandwich for the best Abou Mahmoud -Thank you. -You're still watching the news? No, Dad, there's salt in this one. -This one? -Yes, it's not good for you. Thank you, Mahmoud, thank you. -Shall I turn it off? -Yes. Let me. Thank you, Mahmoud, my darling. Oh, God. In this session, up to 7 billion dollars in the year. What do you think? Is it good? Yes, thank you. The bread is dry, but it's okay. Let me help you. I apologize. For every reason I gave you to hate me and to keep you away from me. Babe, no need to apologize about yesterday. Yes, there is a need for it. I still feel that you are distant, as if you're not yourself. What happened between us for a few months is nothing simple. It pulled us away from each other. Also, what you told me yesterday, is not simple. Would it pull us away from each other? No. There's no way that reason would make me leave you. Perhaps, you'd regret it and feel that you want a family. I want to love you, the family comes later. Later, the child will come, it will, God willing. Now, I have a meeting and I need to finish my work. You go down to the pool and have some fun. -Good morning. -Good morning. I am going back to Beirut today. Me too. I wish I had met you in different circumstances. At a different time. Surely, our relationship would have been better. Maybe. You are like the intelligence bureau, you like to watch people. Can you move away from this window? Tell me, Mona, is Mr. Hadi's brother always like that? What do you mean, like what? As if all the cares of the world are on his shoulders. The poor guy, he changed a lot after what happened to him. What happened to him? We don't sit in the living room, this is not our place. Let's go to the kitchen. What happened to him? He was married and his wife committed suicide. Suicide! You mean because of him? Thank you for the lighter. Not at all. Do you always come to Turkey? Whenever my husband has some business here. -So, you're married. -Yes. It has been six months. -A newlywed. -So they say. How do you find marriage? Is it nice? Are you happy? It's wonderful! The best thing I did in my life. I recommend it to you if you're not married, madam. Call me miss. I am not married, and I don't think I'll ever get married. That's impossible. Do you know why? -Why? -Because marriage is a failed enterprise. It's a big flop, and men are all alike. You may say they all have the same mentality. You cannot generalize. My husband is wonderful. That's good. And where is your husband now? -He has some business. -I also came here for business. But there is a sinister woman who is not letting me do my business. -And that sinister woman is me, for sure. -It's good that you know yourself, Reem. What brought you here? That wasn't our agreement!
