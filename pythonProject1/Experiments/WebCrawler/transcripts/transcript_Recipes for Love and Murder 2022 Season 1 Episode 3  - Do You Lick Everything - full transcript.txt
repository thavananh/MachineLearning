Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- [Maria]Previously on Recipes for Love and Murder... Tannie Maria, the public eagerly await your advice. [Martine]I have a lot of happy hours with my friend, when he is out. She gave me the ducks. The ducks were the first thing that I've ever loved in a completely pure way. [gunshots] You bastard! Fucking kill you, you bastard! [Maria]If you are with a man who abuses you, you should leave him. What's that there? Just a mutton curry recipe I want to try. If I kill him in self-defence of her, how long will I go to jail? What's my surname doing there? I thought it'd look more professional, Maria Purvis. No, no, no. I'm-I'm just, I'm Tannie Maria. That's all. Take it down! [Aileen]Dear Maria. It's so wonderful to have a picture of you in my head. We haven't seen each other in a very long time. Her name is Martine Burger. Her husband is Dirk. That's my lady with the ducks. Anna Pretorius, you need to come with us and answer questions regarding the murder of Martine Burger. You bloody bitch! She hated you, you ugly fuck. [clamoring] - Hey! Hey! - Look out! [gunshot] [Khaya]We found a fire poker with fingerprints that are being tested right now. Early medical records indicate she had sleeping pills in the system. How did she die? [Anna]I got there too late. [whimpering] Call a lawyer, please. I'm surprised the police let you go, you murderous cow. You killed Tienie! [gunshot] [gunshots] You and I should go to Martine's house and see the crime scene for ourselves. I am in. [theme music] [sensor beeps] Wow! A real Karoo health breakfast, huh? Well, after last night up at the Burger's farm I deserve every calorie. Last night? Don't you mean Tuesday night? I know what I mean, Lucille. Do you want a bag? I'm going to ask for a raise. Because nobody should ever be exposed to that much crime and brutality on the job. You're in a police officer. I thought the job must be so exciting. But what happened last night? Was it Dirk? - I know it was Dirk. - Do you want to know something? - Absolutely. - Come here. Once the smell of a dead human body gets inside of your nose, know, you can never get it out again. Thanks, Lucy. Stay safe. [theme music] [music continues] [music continues] [Khaya]Okay. Let's try this again. So last night... you and your colleague illegally entered a crime scene. Well, when you put it like that, yes. But we weren't trying to mess with the crime scene or anything, it was just, I owed it to Martine. She came to me. I know you told us to stay out of it, but Martine reached out to us. She asked me for help. - Hi, Tannie M. - Hello. You ready? - Supplies for the mission? - Yes. No, no, no. Please, don't need to tell me about your food. I'm just, I'm just trying to remember all the details. - I'm just getting my head... - The Burger's house. Tell me about that. [dramatic music] [door creaks] [Maria]It was like Martine had been plucked from the kitchen, but it had stayed untouched. [shutter clicking] Looks like Dirk hasn't been back here since Martine died. Since he murdered her, you mean. Should I get rid of the old fruit, maybe the milk... [whipering] Don't touch anything! Oh. [suspenseful music] Oh. [sniffs] [whipering] Maria! Definitely pomegranate juice. - You licked the counter? - Well, I needed to be sure. So if your DNA turns up on the scene... Well, you know how it got there. Have you seen my daughter recently? Because she didn't come home last night. She wasn't with me. I mean, she-she was, a-at the crime scene, but... - Crime scene?! - It was all work. - She's totally fine. - Ay! My word. I can't with that girl. I had to cancel a blody shift last night because she was working late. - I'm sorry, ma'am. - And you? Are you a good man, Regardt Snyman? I know you have intentions with my daughter. I've got eyes in my head. Ah, hi. Uh, Piet... And now, Charlene, you are still waiting for the detective? Let me go sort him out for you quickly. Thanks, Piet. There was milk, two percent... total waste of time if you ask me. There was a can of chickpeas. I definitely saw some instant coffee, and in the... Knock, knock. Are you done here, detective? Not quite yet. Hello, Piet. Thank goodness it's you. Have you found my Veldskoen's yet? The second we get a lead on that, I'll let you know. Thank you. It's sort of distressing knowing that a killer has your shoes. Oddly enough, our priority is not your footwear. Okay. I'll let you carry on then. [car approaches] [dramatic music] [indistinct] [car door opens] [gunshot] [gunshot] They shot twice. [both breathing heavily] Oh, my God! It was pickle juice. Do you lick everything? Okay, fine. Pickles, your friend is fine. Did you actually see the murder take place? That poor, poor man. - Righto. - Ma, are you okay? - Are the kids okay? - Yes, everything's fine. I'm just here on hospital business. I'm fine, by the way. In case you wondered. We'll talk about it later. I am glad you're safe, Jessica. We didn't see him die. I wish we had, we might have seen the murderer too. That's not a thing you want to live with. Seeing someone get killed. It stays with you. Okay. Pickles... your friend, and then what? We thought we heard the car drive away after a minute or two. [car sputtering] Well, that's when we saw him. [gasps] Lawrence, the gardener... dead. We have to find the killer! First Martine, and now Lawrence. And we need to find my shoes, I don't, I don't understand why the killer took our shoes. Probably to identify and eliminate witnesses. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, I shouldn't have said that. I know you've gone through a lot. I just can't stop thinking about Grace. And the terrible, terrible sound she made. I was there for that bit. Oh, yes. Sorry. Of course you were. [gasps] [screams] [crying] [Maria]I just can't get her out of my head. The pain. Finding your child like that. Um, that's everything. That's all. Well, if there's anything, you call me. Um, uh, um... - Detective. - Yes? After the shooting in the guesthouse, Dirk was still in hospital last night, so he... I've already asked you and your friend to keep out of police business. ANd I'm going to ask that neither of you leave town, since you were present at the night of murder. We have to treat you like suspects. But not real suspects, though just protocol ones. Martine... Deserves a thorough, professional investigation into her death. So does Lawrence Khubeka. And that is my job, not yours. [birds calling] [fenale #1]Gordon! Breakfast. I told you she wouldn't write. [sighs] Okay, I have to get to work, so you're gonna have to take the report. Okay. [clears throat] It's a little sensitive, which is why I thought the detective, but, yeah. Pill boxes and bottles have been going missing at work. And do you think someone at the hospital is an addict? No, they're empty pill bottles and boxes. Why would anyone bother with those? Exactly. At first I thought it's nothing, but then I started to worry, that somebody maybe using the empty pill bottles and boxes to make fake pills look real or something. I can take your statement, Ms. September, but I don't the police force will be able to allocate the right resource... Of course, the murders. Especially two murders. But I would've felt weird saying nothing, so... - I'll investigate for you. - No, Jessie. [Charlene] I don't want that story in your newspaper. People won't bother to read past the headlines. They'll think we're stealing meds. No, not for the paper. To put your mind at ease, ma. Hm. Bye. I can assure you that mentioning poor Mrs. Burger's job at the Koop was purely accurate journalism, and not an attempt by the writer to make shoppers think about death while queing to pay for their wors. [indistinct] You may by all means raise your concerns with other members of the community. Good bye. [sighs] Oh, girls! You're safe! Come, come, come, come. Oh! [sighing] When I heard the news... Oh, that poor man. Yeah, it was awful. But now that you've got all this amateur detective stuff out of your system, maybe we can, in fact, focus on work. Absolutely, Hattie. From now on, I'm going to be Tannie Maria, nothing else. I'll put the kettle on. And I'll focus on work too. Jess the journalist, delivering words on time and on word count. Excellent! I should now pop down to the hospital. - No, but... - For work. It's for work. A human interest story. This town needs human interest, Hatts? Fine. Go. But it'd better make me cry in a good way. I promise it will. [Jeff]Dear, Tannie Maria. I've got a terrible secret. I mean, you are not gonna think it's a big deal, but... I'm worried my fiancee is gonna leave me if I tell her the truth. Okay. - Your favourite again. - Mmm! Mmm. Pop! Oh. Oh. The thing is... despite what most people might think about me, I can't actually cook. I read some of your "Tannie M. Basics" in some old copies of the Gazette, and, I mean, don't get me wrong, I am nailing boiled eggs. But I mean, now that I can do this with one hand tied behind my back, how do I up my game? - Your turn. - Oh, yes, please. - Oh! So good. - Mm-hm. Please. I don't have the courage to tell her yet. Yours, Eggmaster. Oh, yeah... I'm going to leave your coffee here for ya. Oh, thanks. Where're you off to, Maria? Bacon! It's perfect, Hattie. It's just perfect. You bring it home, you see. Alone again. Lucky me. [phone ringing] When did you notice it first? About three weeks ago. The bottles started going missing. - Where're they kept? - In the pharmacy. But also some at each nurses station. I think those were the ones I noticed first. Dr. Visagie told me it was nothing to worry about. He was almost cross that I said anything. Now sister won't let it go. [Dirk]Dirty bitch! Dirk Burger? Listen, I shouldn't say everything, but if you ask me, that man killed his wife, no question. - So that why you're here, Jess? - No, ma. I was asking about the pill... Yes, she asked about the pill bottles. But then we heard Dirk, and... You better get back to your patients now. Yes, thank you. Can you show me where you keep the pill bottles, and any samples you might have? [instrumental music] ♪ There's a bunch up in the trees ♪ ♪ Know how beautiful they are ♪ ♪ If the mountains and the sea ♪ ♪ Know how magical they are... ♪ Are you trying something a little different for your next recipe column, Tannie Maria? - I'm a big fan. - Oh, well, Thank you. - It's not a recipe column... - It's advice for life. I know, yes. And you're so good at it, eh? You just tell it like it is. I'm the same. I don't beat around the bush. I told Cheryl... Cheryl. Cheryl, tell her how I told you about your husband. I told her that her husband was cheating on her for two months before she caught him with her sister. But now, Tannie Maria, who needs vegan advice though? Oh, actually, it's not for a column, I just wanted to do something nice for some vegan kids. That poor little Seventh-day children. Tsk. Martine, God rest her soul, she was very fond of the poor things, eh? How long did Martine work here for? Oh. For as long as I've been here. Martine was just like part of the furniture here at the Koop. You hardly even noticed her. Shame. [indistinct] - Have a lovely day, eh? - Thank you. You too. Cheryl, we'll serve a vegan... Oh! - Oh. - Oh, Tannie Maria? How lovely to see you again. How're things going at the Gazette? [sighing] It was being a wee bit difficult actually, with everything that's, you know? And Hattie? How's she doing these days? Last time I saw her she was alright. You could always ask her yourself next time you call? Yes. I mean, yes. Yes, good. Good. ♪ You need to say it ♪ ♪ I will love you ♪ ♪ I will love you ♪ ♪ You need to say it ♪ ♪ I will love you ♪ ♪ I will love you ♪ ♪ You need to say it ♪ ♪ I will love you ♪ ♪ I will love you ♪ ♪ You need to say it ♪ ♪ I will love you ♪ ♪ Ahh yeah ♪♪ [clucks] If you want to know what's on my mind, Morag... it's pomegranates. They're not that common. Mmm. Mmm. Taste a wee bit of this. Peaches, apricots, plums, you can't escape them, but... pomegranate? Needs a sunny spot, out of the wind. Greenhouse would be perfect, of course. [Tannie gasps] Ooh! Piss off, you great walloper! Baah! Why, you little fool?! Oh, you little... Go! Oh! Shoo! Baah! [indistinct] Something bites. [instrumental music] Hi, ma. Ma? Sorry, Jess. One of my patient's has gotten to me a little bit. A little boy has got cancer. Ash win. [Jessie]Tell me. His parents are on a farm all the way in Bonnievale, so they only get to visit him weekends. That must be awful for them. Shame, and... little boy is so lonely. I keep imagining what if it were Riley... sick and all alone like that. I'm sorry about the other day, ma. And last night when I didn't come home like you asked. [Charlene sighs] I know it's a lot. I know when your father left, even before... I asked a lot of you. You were always so grown up. I don't always feel very grown up. Your dreams are so very big, and far away. I worry about you too. - [Jessie]Hi. - Hi. My mom said there's a cool kid here that she loves to visit 'cause he always makes her feel better, is that you? I think it must be me. I'm the only kid around. [chuckles] Well, it must be my lucky day then. - I'm Jess. - I'm Ash win. How long you've been here? At least four Tuesdays. They serve me fish on Tuesdays. - I hate fish. - Well, that sucks. I like your drawings. - Are you an architect? - Mm-hm. I'm designing houses for me my mom and my dad. Cool. There's nothing in there. [Morag clucks] [Maria]Dear Eggmaster. I'm so glad you're ready to take things to the next level, which I don't know how to say this any plainer, should be telling your fiancee the truth. Hello. [chuckles] [Maria]But if you want to do that with a bang, fine, we'll do it with a bang. We're going to make the best comfort food I know. I can use lots of different fruits, but I like to use kumquats. It's such a pleasing word, isn't it, kumquat. Let the fruit soak for ten minutes, to remove any impurities. Don't go at them, they are not ready. Just like all of us, kumquats have them too. [indistinct] [Maria]Now, bear with me. But before you start, you'll want to put a plate in the freezer. Get some water, sugar, cinnamon and cardamom boiling on the stove. You've already nailed boiling, so this bit's easy. Add your kumquats when your syrup starts to bubble. Ugh! Yes! Ash win! [speaking in foreign language] I solved the case of the missing pill bottles. Oh, that's lovely. So creative! [Maria]You'll be smelling that marmaladey goodness now, and you'll want to get the bacon on. Make sure you have bread handy. Can't imagine you'll be baking your own. I made these the other night for a friend, when we needed a bit of courage, and, well, they did the job, I can tell you. Now, grab that plate. - [Natasha]Babe, are you coming? - Coming! I'm struggling with this piece of parrot. You'll know it's ready when you pull your finger through a spoon of jam and it makes wrinkles, like Father Christmas' forehead. Okay. [rings bell] This is your sandwich. Wow! This is amazing! You didn't want a egg rather. [female #1]Oh, wow! Ah! Mmm! Mmm. - Wow, babes. - Mm. This is mine. Thank you. [sighs] [blowing vuvuzela] [Hadeda squawks] [blowing vuvuzela] Get off! They are my vegetables. They're not yours. Go! Shoo! Get out of.. My vegetables! Go! [blowing vuvuzela] You are not afraid of anything, are you? [mumbling] [knocking on door] Yeah? I come in a matter of missing property. Piet, I don't have time for this. I'm in the middle of a murder investigation right now. Maria left a tupperware of sandwiches for me and Regardt, and it's vanished. I don't know what you're talking about. Bacon and marmalade. Final autopsy for Martine in yet? Cause of death confirmed. There's-there's sleeping pills in her pomegranate juice, and then the blow to the back of the head is what killed her. So, now, where we at with Martine's bank accounts and cellphone tracking? The bank account is being processed. The cellphone tracking request has been authorised. We're waiting for information from her service provider, and a couple of uniforms are out interviewing Lawrences' contacts now, sir. So... Maria's making you sandwiches now? Aren't I lucky? You know, the last time I was working on a murder case, it was gang related, in Diepkloof. Those people were threatening to kill us, our children, and none of the aunties were making my cops sandwiches on the side. Well, when I'm in charge here some day... citizens are gonna take turns making me sandwiches. I'll make it a rule. [phone buzzing] - Let me get this. - Okay. I'll let you know when the phone records come in. Okay. Hey, lollipop. You must tell me everything. Did you get your marks back yet? Hi, Matt. It's Hattie. I was wondering if you were free this evening and interested in an ice-cream? Shall we say 8:00? I'll see you then. Bye. [Hattie whispers] Bye. Bye. [clears throat] Oh. Mr. Van Wyk. I don't remember a meeting? Well, we're not at the business council now. You can call me Cornel. Hello, Cornel. [laughing] Oh! Oh, shoo! It's been a long time since I've seen you, Hattie. I saw you yesterday at the Koop, and the day before at the meeting at Marius'. Yeah, but not like that. Cornel, I told you that can't happen anymore. But, but we had fun together. Sure, we did have fun. So? Look, there is a Koop franchisee weekend at the West Coast this month. - I'm winning a regional award. - Oh. I'm sure you'll have a lovely weekend. Come on, Hattie. Think about it. I'll... I'll bring a bottle of the best wine, hm? The cellar stuff. I'll even throw in an aromatherapy massage. I'll see you at the meeting. Okay. Look, I'm not going to force it. Just think about it. - Cornel. - Hmm? We could meet to discuss your advertising plans for the next few issues. Oh. Coffee in a couple of days? Such a lovely shirt that you are wearing. - Hattie... - Turn around. - Yeah. Yes. - And again. - It is nice. Thank you. - It's a lovely shirt. - You should wear it more often. - I wear it twice a week. [sighs] [Hadeda squawking] It's been a hectic few days, no mistake. I miss my shoes, Morag. And I know they aren't as important as people's lives, but... it made me happy. What is it? Where're you going? [laughing] [engine whirring] Mmm. The Koop, here. Last night. How many gold 4x4s are there in this town? [Morag clucks] No, I don't know either. [instrumental music] I'm sorry for this tragedy. Thank you. Lawrence came to the station the day he died. I know. Can you tell me what he told you? It should be there in his statement. You know, sometimes a man doesn't tell the police everything he knows. [sighs] He was scared to come to you. Nothing good comes of speaking to the police. Yeah, I can understand that. [sighs] He was out walking late at night... the night Martine was killed. Had he heard something? Was he meeting someone? He often walked late at night. His mind was always busy with plans. He saw the lights turned on at the farmhouse, and then suddenly they were off. And... then, headlights. A vehicle was leaving the farm. Did he notice what vehicle? I think he thought it was Mr. Dirk's car. But he wasn't sure, or he didn't tell me. But it was in a rush, a crazy rush, like it was racing away from something. Did the driver see him? What if a son doesn't tell the police or his mother everything he knows? And now he's dead. What happens then? [male vocalizing] - Hey. - Hey. [Dirk]I'm going to make you pay for her death! I'd like to see you try. Hey. Luckily, they're someone else's problem for night shif, ah. I promised I's stay out of the investigation. And Hattie needs me more focused with work. What about you? What do you wanna do about it? You're just lovely. [singing in foreign language] Okay. [singing in foreign language] [male vocalizing] [Hattie]Ay-ya-ya! Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Just harder. A little bit harder. I like it. That was hard. Yes! Yes! Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, that's the spot, that's the spot. So, yes, ever since I got the exercise bike at home I've been able to double my distances each day. And I've started a leg day routine, eight sets of barbell squats, three sets of dumbell lunges, alternating legs. [sighing] Okay, that's enough of foot. Let's do the... shoulders. And, read that to me, Stefan. [sighing] It's Matt. Read that for me, Matt. Coming for a drink? No, thank you. I'm busy here. [male vocalizing] Come on. Don't be such a loner. Regardt is coming too. You trying to make me a nice guy? It's a work in progress. [male vocalizing] Come. Come on. "Ash win says he's inspired by his uncle, who built... his grandma's house himself." "He thinks everyone deserves a well built home, that also looks friendly." "Undoubtedly, an artist to look out for in the future." [sniffles] - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Aren't you going to come around and open the door for me like a gentleman? [male vocalizing] [door opens] [door closes] [sniffles] [singing in foreign language] [speaking in foreign language] Did you know my dad used to drink here? Yeah, him and every other cop in this town. Hey, barman. Brandy for the detective. It's just that... makes me emotional, you know, to think of how I'm doing all the things he used to do. You know he used to be a cop. Now, I'm a cop and... he used to drink here and now I drink here. He married the woman of his dreams and I'm going to marry Jessie. She doesn't know it yet, but, but I will, I'm, I'm going to marry her. It's best to ask her first, bro. I just wish I'd known my father better, you know. He would have been excited to see you in charge here, boss. He always told me... black cops were good people. [laughing] Cheers. Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers for being black. You remind me of my father... quite a lot. - A-and you too, Piet. - Me? Yeah. You know, 'cause you're both really old like him. [laughing] I'm just, I'm kidding. No. No, listen, you, seriously... you're both heroes. - We're just cops, Regardt. - No. No, I mean, you in particular, detective. You know, coming here, starting a new home for yourself, that-that's tough. I don't know if I'll call it a home. ♪ I won't let you down... ♪ [crickets chirping] - Tannie M. - Yes, Jessie? You remember we both promised Hattie we were done investigating? Yes, that was this morning. I've changed my mind. I know I thought it was Dirk, but he was in hospital when Lawrence died. We owe it to Martine, to Lawrence, to Lawrences' mother Grace. I keep seeing her face when she saw Lawrences' body. We owe it to them, Maria. - You're right. - I am? I mean, yes. I am. I know I can do a proper investigation. And you know what, Maria? You're really smart too. [chuckles softly] Thank you, Jessie. I did know that. [machine beeping] Woah, woah, woah, you're not leaving. No, I'm, I'm gonna sing a song. I didn't know this's karaoke night. Every night is a karaoke night if you're Regardt. [Laughs] Listen, when I start singing, please phone me, okay? I wanna send it to Jessie. [Piet] Yeah, sure. [Regardt] Promise, huh? Of course, yes, of course. So, what happen to Regardt's dad? - Did he retire? - Nah. - He killed himself. - Oh. [Piet] When Regardt was still a teenager. You know, he was the one who discovered his dad. Oy, that's terrible. [Piet] He could have gone either way, that boy. His younger brother, he's on drugs now, in and out of rehab. But Regardt... he does this. Righto. Everyone, if you don't mind, I'm gonna, gonna sing a little song. [strumming guitar] This one goes out to someone very special to me and... her name is Jessie. [strumming continues] [singing in foreign language] [singing continues] [singing continues] She's never going to reply. I still think the pomegranate juice has to mean something. Hm. She came home from the Koop, she didn't even have time to unpack, she had the juice... - Martine and her murderer. - Probably, yes. But there was no pomegranate juice anywhere in the house, and there was none in the shopping. So, either the killer brought the juice... Or took it away with him. But why would you do that? Fingerprints! Incriminating evidence. And why would Lawrence agree to meet him there? Sounded like he knew him. Unless it was Dirk. Could he have slipped out of the hospital somehow? [singing in foreign language] [theme music] [music continues]
