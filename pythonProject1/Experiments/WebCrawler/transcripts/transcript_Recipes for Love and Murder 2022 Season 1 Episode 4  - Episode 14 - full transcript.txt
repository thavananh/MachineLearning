Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- Previously, on Recipes For Love And Murder... - Her name is Martine Burger. - That's my lady with the ducks. You and I should go to Martine's house and see the crime scene for ourselves. I'm in. Last night... you and your colleague illegaly entered a crime scene. Maria. Definitely pomegranate juice. - You licked the counter? - Well, I needed to be sure. They shot twice. Well, that's... Lawerence the gardener dead. Lawerence came to the station the day he died. - Can I help you? - Miss Burger. Miss Martine. I was her gardener. My mother was her domestic. He was scared to come to you. Nothing good comes of speaking to the police. He was out walking late at night... the night Martine was killed. I can assure you... that mentioning poor Mrs. Burger's job at the corp was purely accurate journalism. And not an attempt by the writer to make shoppers think about death while cuing to pay for their Voss. You may by all means raise your concerns with other members of the community. Goodbye. But what about you? What do you wanna do about it? You're just lovely. I miss you. I miss talking about the old years. And make cake. I'm surprised the police let you go, you murderous cow. You killed Tienie. Oye! Go back to bed. You're bleeding all over my nice clean floor! All right, can I just get my crutch. Aye! I'm calling the police. Thank you. My sister will meet you in Makhanda. Fire poker has Anna's prints, but she's explains that. Dirk sadly has a strong alibi. Then Lawrence dies, at Martine's house because he knows too much? Okay, we hit up Dirk and Anna first, no messing about, tell us all about Martine. And we make sure not to call Dirk an abusive piece of shit and accidentally punch him in the face. I think when you say we there, uh, actually you mean you. Next stop, Ma Grace. We don't know a lot about Lawrence at all, and how his death is linked to Martine's. Oh, and add a few more vetkoek, just in case we need to get on the good side of the cops along the way. Don't worry, we'll have enough here to bribe a small army. Operation Vetkoek! Operation Vetkoek! ♪ Mama sing, mama sing, mama happiness you bring ♪ ♪ Mama go, make your food, as it's gonna taste so good ♪ ♪ Mama fetch you the money, mama look at some honey ♪ ♪ Mama sing, mama sing ♪♪ - Oh! - Watch where you're going. Ah, our local news hound. It's amazing how you always get to the crime scene before me. Maybe, you should be my prime suspect. Maybe I'm just a better investigator than you. I hope you realise your stories are not more important than actually finding the killer? And I hope you're not afraid of journalists reporting on the truth about the paternalistic condescending... Vetkoek, detective? The truth is, two citizens have been murdered, and the big bad detective has no idea who did it. Watch yourself. - So, big bad detective? - He bumped into me. Can we come in? We brought snacks. Maybe just one. Thank you. How are you Anna? You must really miss Martine. Martine... she was like... sunlight. Beautiful, bright... light. I loved her, Tannie Maria, I really did. Did Martine know? That you loved her... that you're gay? Of course she did. I told her, didn't I? Oh, she never loved me like that, but I was her best friend. Sounds like high school maybe, but that's what we were. I think that sounds lovely. To have a friend and... to know that they love you. In her last letter to me, Martine said she was making a plan to leave Dirk. She never told me. I'm glad, but she never told me. How did you and Martine meet? Um... We knew each other just from around, but we met properly when I fixed their tractor. I'm a few farms down and... I heard that they were having trouble, and Dirk is no good at fixing things. Martine made me coffee. Can I have another vetkoek please? Oh, of course you can. I hope you feel better soon Anna. In your heart also. I especially asked for full time police guard! Play you for first shift. Ms. Pretorius. Could you tell me what happened here last night? I was asleep. Didn't Ms. September tell you that she caught Dirk trying to kill you? You'd be within your rights to lay charges against him. Attempted murder. Don't you want see him go to jail? - He tried to kill you! - He did worse to Tienie. So make him pay. For this at least. You do things your way, detective. And I'll do them mine. And now for the next item in the agenda. A few members of the business council have raised the importance of members supporting each other publicly. Yes, well look, at the Koop we've started a community wall where local businesses can put up their posters and flyers for free. I wonder if the committee would have a small budget for this? I'd like to run a profile on one of our business owners every week, a proper in depth interview that gets to the heart of who our local entrepreneurs are. Maybe you could get to the heart of why that foreigner insists on cooking all his food with so much garlic. It's Italian food, that's how it's made. Anyway, he's not foreign, he's from De Aar. I mean, I think that sounds like a good idea Hattie. I think we'd all appreciate the support from the Gazette. - Oh! - However... Since we're all offering our support for free... Oh! Good point, good point. No special treatment here! Before we head back, let's go to the Burger's farm again. Want another look? I can't shake the feeling that I'm missing something. ♪ Mama's gonna sought you out ♪ ♪ Mama's gonna sought you out ♪ ♪ Mama's gonna sought you out ♪ ♪ Mama's gonna sought you out ♪♪ - Hey, so... - Ah, Jess. As long as you're not planning on pulling out any weapons I'm not going to stop you. We're just going to give him vetkoek. Oh, ah! Thanks Tannie. You know, he would've let us in without offering him one. Ah, shame, the poor boy deserves a treat. Dirk. Hey! You're not the nurse. Dirk... did you go shopping for Martine the day she died? I never went shopping for Martine. I was a bad husband! - Did you kill Martine, Dirk? - No! They found her fingerprints on the fire poker. The cop didn't think I could hear him, but I did. Anna killed her. We don't think that she did. We think the same man that killed Lawrence killed Martine. - Lawrence is dead? - Yeah. I liked Lawrence. Tell me who killed Lawrence. I'll kill him. I'll kill him. I'll kill that bloody woman. Oh, Dirk. You haven't changed a bit. Dirk's friends? - No! - Friends of Martine. You must be her cousin! The fashion one! Yes. I've come to arrange her funeral. - Candice Webster. - Would you like a vetkoek? Oh, wow. Vetkoek. Haven't had one of these in ages. I'm Jessie, sorry, Jessie September, a reporter from the Gazette, this is Tannie Maria. Pleasure to meet you. Since you're Martine's friends, um, I could use some help. This all has been such a shock to me and... Well, Dirk's an idiot, he couldn't organise gravity to drop an apple. - Hey! - Of course we'll help. Thank you. First question. Where do we get a frozen daiquiri? I hope I didn't put you on the spot earlier. I-I thought it was an excellent idea. Y-you remember last year when we gave Stefan from the hotel the budget for a special event. The others would not let me hear the end of it. Yes, that was very tiresome. I, um... I-I want to take out a Koop advert on your profile page. Perhaps, we could discuss that over a coffee. That's very kind of you. I've been so impressed with your thorough reporting on these tragic murders. Jessie is a superb talent. I'm very lucky to have her. Spoken like a true editor. So... Careful. That coffee? I'd love to, but I can't right now. Deadlines! B-but soon! Hattie! I was hoping to catch you. Doep! I know the rent. I understand, and I do apologise, I'm afraid a lot of my advertisers paid their bills late. So you think you're gonna be able to make a payment today? Within the next 24, 48, 96 hours. You know, I've got a lot of mince that needs moving. - Something wrong with it? - No nothing. It's just not a lot of home cooks know what to do with a kilogram of mince. - Bobotie? - Ah, Hattie. A girl can only take so much bobotie, you know what I'm saying? Maybe they just need a good recipe to... guide them. Hmm. - Oh, good! - Oh, morning Hattie! How was your political thingy? Dismal as usual, thanks for asking. - But perhaps you can explain... - Vetkoek? Thanks. Perhaps you can explain all this? Jessie and I were just mapping out some thoughts. On my wall? Well, it's helpful to have a visual. Going to have to update it all now anyway. Met Martine's cousin, Candy, at the hospital. Jessie just gone to have a drin... An interview with her. Oh, that reminds me. Maria I need you to write about mince. How does Jessie having a drink with Candy remind you of mince? I-i-it doesn't, I was trying to be subtle. Oh. I don't know, Hattie. I mean, I can't be sure that mince is the answer to my letter writer's emotional needs. Mince is not very inspiring to a cook. It's my emotional need. "Dear Tannie, may I call you Tannie?" I like to imagine you really are my aunt and that you bring me delicious cookies on Saturdays. You see, Tannie, what I really, really want to know is who my dad is. It's like knowing you're a delicious cheesecake but not knowing if you're chocolate or berry flavoured. But how do I know which one of my mom's exes is my dad? She says it's not important, that we are twin souls wandering this universal plane together, but you and I know that sex must have come into it somehow, Tannie. Please help Tannie, I know you've got my back with this. Sincerely. Do you know what Hattie. I think mince is the way. Hallelujah! It all depends where Lawrence really was. If he was just outside his own house, he'd have only seen the headlights. Yeah, I was thinking that too. If he was close to the farmhouse, he could've seen the murderer. Or the murder. But why are they so hung up on pomegranate juice? - Jessie and Maria? - Yeah. It was Martine's favourite, they wondered if someone who knew that used it to drug her and we know from forensics she had a bunch of sleeping pills in her system. Dirk doesn't grow any pomegranates. Ah, I thought solving a murder in a small town would be easier. - You know, fewer suspects. - Small town people ain't simple. I need to... Just see if you can ask Dirk about pomegranate juice. Pomegranate juice. And see if Martine made her own, or if he bought her any. U-uh, okay boss, um, it... It's just that he's not exactly responsive at the moment. - I'll try a bit later. - Okay. Well, that's fine. I'm gonna kill you, you bitch! Um... Hello, I-I'm warrant officer... Okay. - Thank you. Mm-hmm. - Really? The family is rolling in it. Grandpa Coetzee struck gold, literally. And he left it all to his sons, Peter and Paul. Typical. But Martine didn't seem rich. Oh, no, no, no, her dad, my Uncle Peter, had this crazy idea the kids needed to make their own way in life, never gave them a cent. Luckily I got the generous brother, Paul, as my dad, he helped me set up my fashion business in the New York. That must have been great having that support. Yeah, it was. I miss him. So was Martine close to her dad, despite the miserliness? No, no, not at all. Martine was very private about everything. I asked her brother, David today if he knew how Martine's daughter was doing. Turns out he didn't even know Jamie existed! Do you think she was embarrassed, that she had special needs, or... that she had to send her away for school, maybe? I think she just didn't like her brother. He's like roadkill without the personality. Of course now that Martine's dead, when Uncle Peter dies he's gonna be filthy rich roadkill. - Friend of yours? - Sort of a friend. I guess you could say that. Oh, waiter. A shot of tequila, please. - Jessie? - Oh, I'm still okay, thank you. Ah, that's better. I understand wanting to know where you came from, but I hope you know that your father might not be who you want him to be, and that's okay. You're not your father. You rest overnight. That applies to us as well as the dough. Come on chook. Can you believe, he thought I'd be so impressed that he played rugby that I'd kiss a total stranger in the pub! And he was a big man Maria. Obviously, top of your "husband checklist." Oh, he's right up there with a what's your star sign and your father's occupation! Obviously, first questions I asked Mickey. Talking about me behind my back, are we? Oh, it's just a wee girl chat. We've come to the conclusion, there's not a single man left that's not a drunk, a complete narcissist or a total nutjob! - No, I didn't... - Easy. I'll get you a cup for some tea, love. Wee lil' lovebirds, eh? Oh, aye. Onions, curry powder, cumin, ginger, coriander, cinnamon, turmeric. Your beef mince of course. Don't worry, it's not too spicy, so even if your potential dad is a wee bit scared of flavour, he'll still enjoy. Apricot jam, tomato paste, and fresh tomatoes. The fruitiness of the apricots and tomatoes is the real secret, it'll soften any heart. You again! Not my choice of breakfast. Fry the onions off 'til they're soft and glossy, and then add your spices. Then let the heat do the work. Check your dough, and if it's all gorgeous and airy, divide it up into balls. Keep an eye on your mince, you can have a poke at it with a fork every now and then if it clumps. Flatten the dough until it's about 3cm high, and the size of your palm. Now. Time to fry! You'll know when they're done! Now slice them open! If you give each potential Pa a vetkoek, well, you'll get a good taste of them. Whatever flavour it turns out you are, you're very sweet. Love, call me Tannie. Tannie Maria, I can't believe that I was nice to that American slut! - Were you and Martine close? - Mm-hmm. We were like sisters. I miss her. - So she got a wee bit tipsy? - Mm-hm. I'm laughing at her brother not knowing he's an uncle, I didn't know my cousin was being abused. I think it must be hard to admit that sort of stuff. Probably. Luckily, I can't speak from experience. Women don't like to admit that they're vulnerable. It feels like weakness. I drove past the hotel this morning, and her car was still there. My cousin Jared, he was just coming off of work, so I asked if Candy was staying there. The blonde? Hey! Her car's just still parked here 'cause she went home with your cop friend last night. Regardt? Such a gentleman. Yeah, and the way she kissed him, I reckon that brah got lucky last night. It's probably just a misunderstanding. - Maybe she was just... - Tasting his face? I'm sorry Jessie. I didn't want a boyfriend. Men are trash, you know. And I like being independent. But you did want Regardt. I think I did. Hi, are Maria or Jessie here? Nope, it's just me. I'm the editor. Hattie Wilson. How can I help you? Hattie. Oh, it's so good to meet you. Jessie's told me all about you how generous and kind you've been. - I'm Martine's cousin, Candice. - Oh. But everyone calls me Candy. I'll just wait here for the girls. Sure, just make yourself at home. You know, I thought the lady at my guesthouse was pranking me when she said, the Gazette office is in the butchery. It's like a butterfly in a hoghouse! It's nice and central. That-that scarf? Is is French? - You like it? - Well... Y-y-you can have it. - No, no. I couldn't possibly. - No. Please. It suits your colouring far better than mine. Oh! Perfect. That's just too adorable. Thanks, Candy. Candy. What I should tell you is... Candy says Martine's family is totally loaded. But her father is a miser, which is why she was broke. And her brother didn't know that she had a daughter! The one thing Martine praised Dirk for. Taking good care of their daughter, paying for the school she's at. I mean, she sounded proud of her. Ready to finish Operation Vetkoek? Ready. Hello, mama. I'm Jessie, this is Tannie Maria. You gave me cake before. Your roses are so beautiful! Amazing. They're Lawrence's roses. He was a real artist. We're from the Gazette. Can we ask you about Lawrence? I'm so sorry. I'm so very sorry. It's difficult inside. I'm cleaning and packing. - You're packing, Mrs... - Zihlangu. You can call me Grace. Oh, I brought these. I'm leaving. First to Makhanda for the funeral and then to Cape Town. - You have family there? - Mm-hm. I want to study there. I don't want to clean anymore. You worked for Martine. Wednesdays and Fridays. So you weren't there the day she died? Monday's, Tuesday's and Thursday's I work for Mr. Marius. It was a horrible thing that happened to her. She was such a good person. I wish I could've worked for her only. Is the work hard at Mr. Rabie? I'm not afraid of hard work. He's not a nice man. In fact, even Miss Martine didn't like him. Did she tell you that? A few weeks back he drove me home because he wanted to speak to her. She opened the door, took one look at him, and told him to... He became so angry, he drove over Lawrence's roses. What did he want? He didn't tell me. What kind of car does he drive? A big gold one. Did Martine have any other visitors? Her friend Anna. She used to be so happy when Anna came to visit. Anyone else? A man. He would sometimes have tea with her. - What did they talk about? - Mm-hm. It's private, I don't listen. Sometimes we hear things even by mistake. She told him things were in the past. And he was very cross about that. - Have you spoken to the police? - Only briefly. Thank you very much for talking to us Grace. I hope your move goes well, I'll just grab the vegetables I brought for you. Oh, are those curried mince? The recipe's in the paper, you can make your own. What have I said about you turning up everywhere in my investigation? Only that you're jealous of how fast I am. Thank you. - Oh, let me get that. - It's not heavy. Oh, I know, I thought I'd spare you from our grumpy detective. How do you get these sweet potatoes so big? Special compost? Raise the beds, keep them warm. That's a neat good tip, thank you. Oh, Maria! Listen, thanks for the mince recipe, it was fabulous. Oh. Well, I'm glad you liked it. I Love it, listen... Not everyone has the chops to cook with mince. You know what I'm saying? Oh, Maria! Welcome to police HQ. He's not here is he? - Who? - Never mind. Maria, so good to see you again. Thanks again for everything. Jessie, just the person I wanted to see. I just stopped by to tell you, I was doing the graveyard run. Oh, you will! You darling! That sounds positively awful, I hope it's not the hangover from last night's fun! The graveyard run is beautiful actually. Getting to interview some locals about Martine and Lawrence. It's a real tribute. Remember to include Tannie Elna, remind her that the Gazette is relevant in her life. Thanks Jessie, I know you find these cringey. Oh, it's no problem. It's my job. Looks like someone can't handle her drink! Oh, Maria, did you learn anything new from Grace? Just, um... Another man had been visiting Martine, and talking about the past. Hey, lollipop. What's happening? Nothing to report this side. I'm just about to go into study group. - You okay? - I am bit worried. There's this additional psych text book, it wasn't part of the prescribed list at the beginning of the year. But everybody has it and they say it's just so helpful. Okay, I see how it is. You're calling because you need cash. Do you have my name saved in your phone as ATM? You know, I wouldn't ask, unless it was actually gonna help with my marks. Ah, I'm only teasing. I'll deposit a few hundred into your account. - Thanks dad. - Alright, lollipop. - Bye. - Bye. Ugh, I wish mom had cooked before she went out. You'll just have to put up with it. Why doesn't Maria cook for us, she's your friend, isn't she? - Colleague. - Still, she loves cooking. I'm sure she'd cook for us. You can either eat the bloody food that I make you or starve for all I care! I'm telling mom that you're mean, Jessie! Is it a guy? Yeah. It's, uh, Regardt. We were both at the hotel bar... he didn't come over or say anything, he just... he just ignored me. Was he with his white friends? Why should that matter? This town Jessie. You know it better than I do, you write about it all the time. That's not all, he, uh... He left with another woman. And was she white? I'm just saying. ♪ I see the sunrise ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, oh, oh... ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, oh, oh ♪♪ Oh, are you also getting flowers for Grace? I had hoped to find something for her in the garden but the right flowers are not blooming now. Lawrence grew such beautiful ones himself, I thought it would be a lovely gesture. I'm not getting flowers for Grace. It would be a bit unprofessional, I think. I'm just saying, if you wanted to get her that bunch, you still can. Oh, okay, thanks. I hope whoever you're getting flowers for, they love them. Oh, actually, it was, um... Oh, no, it's a complicated thing. I have a teenage daughter, and... Well, I've been dealing with some teenage angst myself lately. Oh, you have a teenager too? Mine is in at the first year at the University of Cape Town, And how old's yours? Oh, no, I don't, I don't have any children. But you just said that you're dealing with a teenager? Uh, not mine. It was a-a-a letter writer! A girl in search of a father actually. At least yours is not in search of you. Hattie. Hattie has a teenager! Her boy is in boarding school. Khaya's really missing his daughter, maybe you two should bond. Oh, it's so hard, isn't it? I mean, I wept the first few nights without him. It's really difficult. If you ever need to talk, just call me. - I'll do so. - Nuts about nuts. You're here early! And you're actually here! This just got slipped under the door for you. Oh! Dear Tannie! A lot has happened, I think maybe you're actually my fairy godmother not just my aunt. Mom got pretty mad when she found out I was stalking all her exes. She told me the truth about my dad, he was quite boring really, and he died a long time ago. But, but, but, Tannie, good news! - Would you like to try one? - Thank you. Mom's ex Clint, he really liked the vetkoek, and he told me he still really likes mom. That looks like a Tannie Maria special if you ask me, And he's coming over for dinner tonight! Alright. Fine, fine. Marius Rabie giving you trouble again? No, it's Jessie. She said she's sick, so she's going to have to work from home. Ma, I know you have a lot to do. I was just wondering if I could ask you some more questions. I don't know anything more about Lawrence's death. What about his life? And your life? I want to write a story about you. We run the local newspaper but we've never had someone like you in our front page, that's bad journalism. Please let me interview you so we can do better. Maria! Hattie! I'm so glad you're here. What is it? Should I put the kettle on? No time for that, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, Grace told you a man had been visiting Martine? Yes? Ladies, I know exactly who the murderer is.
