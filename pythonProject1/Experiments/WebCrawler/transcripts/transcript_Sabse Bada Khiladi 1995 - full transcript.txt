You have the permission. Thank you, your honor! 15 years ago, l and my forefathers were landlords of Gosupur Village. lnspector Vijay's father.. And this woman's husband were our neighbours. These people borrowed so much money from us.. Then they couldn't pay us the Principal nor the interest. Their land became ours. That's why this conspiracy to bring me a bad name. l have some photographs.. ..which clearly show the accused committing a murder and a rape. lf this is a conspiracy, where did the photographs come from?

The lnspector should be made to realise that.. ..he's not in his torture room, but in the temple of justice. But, sir.. Officer, behave yourself! Sorry, sir. The conspiracy to slander me has been exposed. And this woman is a prostitute. she pretends to be innocent. When she couldn't cool her passions from her husband.. ..she used to approach me. And today she has ensconced herself in the brothel. Stop it now! And today this whore forces.. ..young girls into prostitution. she wants to sell girls to the brothels. Aunt! Gomti aunty..aunty!

Sunita, you go to the court and have a registered marriage with Lallu. According to the will all the property.. ..will be yours and of Lallu's. Then take a divorce from Lallu. Yes! Then all the property will be yours! Then marry Amit and enjoy! It's my responsibility got you divorced! Dad, you are great! Congratulations! - From day you are husband and wife. Congratulations, Mrs. Lallu Ram. Congratulations, Lallu Ram. - You are shaking hands! Give me a hug, sir! I got married! Hearty congratulations! Doctor sir! - Bless you.

Excuse me. - Sure..sure. Mr.Sharma! - Hey! Great man! What a mixture you are! - What do you mean? Fooling everyone along with sir all the money.. ..you have even taken his daughter also! And an intelligent police officer like me was left dancing! Inspector Mr.Kekada, your body is crooked.. ..your brain is crooked your mustache is crooked. At least talk straight! - Listen, I will.. I'll become straight but this dog's tail will always remain crooked! Ladies and gentleman.. may I have your attention please. Thank you. Sunita, all yours. Now it's time to tell you all a story. A fraud can into my father's life. He entrapped my father in talks in such a way.. ..that he transferred all his property in his name! Are you in your senses, Sunita dear? Don't know why papa thought that.. ..I will marry this Lallu for money! Yes. I did get married but not for the sake of money. But to teach a lesson to this Lallu. My aim was to take the property away from him.. ..which he had fooled my father and got it. What are you saying, Ms. sunita? What are you saying! After the divorce all this property will be mine! I might even give it to the orphan children.. ..but I fraud might take it away I couldn't accept that. Daughter! - I will marry only Amit! I don't consider this marriage as a marriage! The cat has started growling! When divorce has to happen it will happen. But now, you are my legal wife. And any power in this world cannot take this right away from me. Oh bless you, son! Great! Great! Great! Great! Applause! Applause! Congratulations on your wedding! Bless you, Lallu Ram! Wow! What a.. Mr.Lallu Ram, this piece of paper is also a part.. ..of Mr. Das's will and he had told me.. ..to read it out when any such a occasion arises! It is possible that Sunita does an act of getting married.. ..to Lallu and then later tries to take a divorce. If the divorce takes place then all my property.. ..will be of Lallu's and only of Lallu. A fraud. This is a fraud! - My son had foresighted about it! Come on, Sunita! - Beware if you take my wife's name! Run, stupid, run! Very Good! Amit! - Not Amit! Not Amit! Lallu! You have misused my innocence! From today all that is over! In this house from today only my orders will be followed! Listen, my darling! At 6 in the morning one bowl of milk.. ..and if it becomes 6.05 then I will crash.. ..your bones and make kohl out of it! At 8.00 two maize breads. In the afternoon at 1.00 lunch. At 3.00 pm curd. And at 6.00 pm again food. You will wash the clothes! - No! You will clean the room. The drainage in which there in the.. ..bathroom that will be clean by you. And you all.. will have fun. I say out you go! Sir! - I say out you go! And you..- No! You will fulfill one more duty of yours! No! No! Leave me! Leave me! Help! He is not a human he is an animal! An animal! He enters the room whenever he wishes! He tries to rape me. Sometimes I call the servant and.. ..save my dignity and sometimes locking myself in the bathroom! But till when? Till when I will save myself! See! See how badly he has hit me! See! Your father also has made us entrapped in this problem! Now even after the divorce the property will be his only. Enough. It' enough. It's better than this that I die! Sunita! Have you gone crazy, Sunita! Yes..yes I have gone crazy! What will I do by staying alive! 'Property worth crores of rupees will get out of my hands!' 'Now I will only have to do something!' If someone has to die then it won't be you, Sunita. He will have to die! What? What do you mean? The meaning is clear, Sunita. We can become each other's.. ..only when Lallu is no longer in this world. You mean murder! No.. no we cannot do such a serious thing! Sunita, I can do anything for you! Even murder! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop the car! Stormy night and Mr.Kekada you are roaming with your baton! Duty, sir, duty! I have a request. - To me? What? More than the question of our life's the question of my increment! If the increment is lost then I will die! That's why if someone tries to murder you then you don't die. Stay alive, ok! - Murder, and that too of mine! Who will try to kill me? - Amit! And may be even Sunita will be with him in it! They both don't have any option left other than this. ..I know this much that Indian woman has degraded.. ..themselves so much that they start killing their own husbands! Whatever is left I will fulfill that today. Hey! Hello! Listen! Here I am roaming with a baton in the rains! And he is in a mood to celebrate his wedding night! Who? - Your husband! You are opening the door with love, darling, or I should break it? Have you come back to your senses, love? I want to tell you something. Say, darling, I am dieing to hear it. You leave this city and ran away. So that yours and Amit way is cleared? Amit..Amit is going to kill you! Really? - Yes. You are not with him in this holy deed? I was..but now I am not. I cannot all that.. No Lallu, please run away from here! Run! Before he kills you run away from here! Leaving you alone? Never! Why are you thinking about me? Who am I of yours? Wife! If I don't think about my wife then who will? Lallu! Sunita, if the intention of my murder has made you.. ..realized then I am very much thankful to Amit for it! I won't mind even if I die today! I am very happy have you as my wife! I am very happy! "Apply vermillion on my forehead." "Come on, love me." "By uniting the bodies always bestow your love on me." "This servant of yours has been thirst for you from so many lives." "Apply vermillion on my forehead." "Come on, love me." "Without you.. I don't have anyone else." "This thread of my love is not weak!" "Taking the young bud of my heart." "I am going to worship you, beloved!" "Apply vermillion on my forehead." "Come on, love me." "My heart is yours, you comprehend that!" "My craziness, you recognize that!" "Even if I die, sweetheart. I will have a rebirth, darling!" "Apply vermillion on my forehead." "Make..make love to me." "By uniting the bodies always bestow your love on me." "I was restless for you from so many lives!" "Apply vermillion on my forehead." "Make..make love to me." Amit! Amit.. Amit..Amit! - Sunita! Sunita! Help me. Amit, help me. Sunita! Is he dead? - What? I will go and check. No. he is just unconscious. Sunita, have you forgotten the plan or what? Now..now.. we have to put him in deep freeze. After staying the whole night in 0 degrees.. ..he will freeze to death till morning. Morning before the servants arrive I will wear Lallu's clothes. And we both in Lallu's car will go uphill road.. ..on the way to the new factory. There, by making Lallu sit.. ..on the driver's seat we will throw the car into gorge. People will get Lallu's body but as his body was in the freeze.. ..the whole night it cannot be proven.. ..in the postmortem that he died last night. The corpse will still be fresh. Come on, let's put him in the freezer. Come on. Who is it? Sunita! What fell down? Lallu! Dear, you are there, right? Yes? Hey, who is there? Sunita..where are you both? Go! Go! Fast! Who is it? - Go, stop her! Grandma! Sunita dear, I am very happy today. You accepted Lallu as your husband! Lallu..Lallu dear, come to me! You both come. Come. Come to me. Come. Bless you, son. Won't you embrace me? Grandma, he is felling shy! - Oh! He is a very stupid son of mine! Grandma, it's late in the night. You go to sleep. - Yes..yes. Amit, you hurry up! I made grandma go to sleep and came. Sunita, hurry up and open this. Come on..come on. What kind of noise is coming? Has he regained consciousness? Shut up! Shut up, Sunita! Come on, let's go and check. Amit, I am getting scared! Oh Shit! Where did the corpse go? Come on..- Help! Amit! Help..help! Amit! No! Amit! Amit! Leave! Leave me! Amit! Amit, help! Leave me! Amit..Amit! Help! Amit! He's dead. His breathing has stopped. Who must have come at this time? I don't know. I'll see. What's the matter, sir? Open the door. I have some work with madam. Oh shit! Sunita..Sunita.. police! The police have come! What? Listen, I am putting him in the freezer. You handle them. And listen.. don't let them come in the kitchen. Go! Go fast! My salute to you, madam! You..why have you come here? Amit! I'm searching for Amit. Amit! Where is he? People usually come to meet their girlfriend at late night. So he didn't come here. What do you mean to say? He came here. Amit came here. Anyway.. This is our personal matter, inspector.. ..and Lallu is aware of this. You smoke too! But where is Mr.Lallu? I can't see him here. Lallu is gone to the.. ..mountain to fulfill the dad's dream. Strange! That idiot was telling me that he.. ..will enjoy the first night of marriage! Mind your tongue..- Who is it, dear? Lallu was here until 11 o'clock. So after Mr.Lallu's enjoyment of the night was over.. ..you called over your boyfriend! Shut up, inspector! Shut up! Grandma, please go inside. I think there's something wrong going on, inspector! I wonder what games this girl is playing! Grandma, you have gone mad! Go to your room! Ok! Ok, I'm going! I am going. - It happens! It happens! People usually go.. ..mad when they become old. Now let's come to the point, madam. Where is Amit? He's gone. If he's gone, then what am I doing here? Even I'll make a move. Mid-night..? Who has carried water mid-night? Why are you going inside? So this water is flowing from here! - Get out of my house! Inspector, I am telling you, you.. - Such a big freezer! A goat can completely fit in this! Or even a dead body. It's very cold! I am completely frozen! Madam, why is this freezer completely empty? Neither there is rasgulla in it, nor is there rasmalai. Absolutely empty! Such a big kitchen! We policemen.. ..don't even have such big house! Madam, you said that he had all ready left! So were you having a bath tonight over there? No inspector.. as soon as I filled water in the jug.. ..and reached the hall, the call bell rang.. ..and the jug fell from my hand. And that's why there is water everywhere. So this is the reason for this spilt water! Yes! Sunita.. I told you before only that if.. ..anyone comes, then let him come, didn't I? After all..why should we hide? When..when Lallu himself knows.. ..then why should we hide it from the world. You are right! You are absolutely right! If at all a person would like to present an award for.. ..the most shameless person of the world.. ..then I will suggest your names. Wow! You Indian woman! Sir and madam! So late! Let's go. Amit, coat. Coat. Put that hand. Stop it! Who can it be? - I don't know. Amit..- Shut up, Sunita! Who are you? Kekada! How come you are here? After all I'm the Almighty. You murdered Lallu! You thought Kekada is a fool! Kekada won't understand even.. ..after seeing the marks on the wall! You thought Kekada is a donkey! Kekada..- Put your hands forward! Put your hands forward! I have to make you wear these handcuffs. Kekada brother, please help us! Please save us, brother! Brother! Brother! As soon as you are in a problem.. ..you have started making relations with me, madam! Look, even I have children! And I have a beautiful wife too! The more the wife is beautiful, the.. ..more are the expenses and demands. My children study in English medium school. My entire salary goes in their fees. Now if I want to save the increment, then.. ..we have to make the incident of murder an accident.. You donkeys! Did you understand.. ..anything or am I talking to fools! How much do you want? 1 cr..crore. 1 crore! Done. Then..what are we wasting time for? Even I'll perform the last rituals of Mr.Lallu! Madam, you take care of the steering.. ..sister, you take care of the steering. Brother, you come with me. Push with all your strength! You made a very good story! Push with all your strength! Lallu left for the mountain, but he didn't reach there. Push with all your strength! God knows when his car fell into the gorge. And Lallu brother is gone! Good bye, Lallu brother! No! No! You can not die! You can not leave your grandma and go! Constable..- Sir is not here. Constable! Sir! I am fired! What's the matter, sir? Today you were not here the whole day! I don't have time. Yes sir. - Did anyone come? Yes sir, yesterday after you went.. ..commissioner sir had called up. I felt like to inform you. What did he say..- Thank you. But I didn't know where you were. He was asking for you. What did you say? I said that sir has gone to inquire about.. ..a murder case.. - Enough! Go and get the file. Sir, my promotion.. - Go and get the file! Hello, inspector Vijay here. This is commissioner Sinha speaking. Yes sir. You have been transferred to Bombay.. - Yes sir. Yes, inspector Kekada has resigned.. ..you will take over from tomorrow. That's all. Is that clear? Thank you, sir! Thank you very much! 'Amar Singh, now you watch the game of my brains.' Sir, phone for you. Hello. - The oil in your bottle is over, Amar Singh. Inspector! Where are you, bastard? I am nearby you, Amar Singh. Don't get up! Don't get up! Why are you taking the trouble? I am coming to finish you off. I am coming, Amar Singh. I am coming. Bastard! Scoundrel! Call our men! Quickly! Stop, inspector! Stop. Stop where you are. Where you're standing is not government property.. ..but it Amar Singh's kingdom. Even if you take one step ahead.. ..then you won't go back by your legs. You are too much, Amar Singh. I thought that you always think before doing anything. I use my brains at the right place.. ..and power at the right place. Baban, Chhotu, Raja, break this bastard's bones! Come, Baban and group. Come let's play with bones. Where has everyone disappeared? Where is that inspector? Catch him! Why did you leave him? I'm close to you. I have come to measure your neck. Call Baban, Shaban and Raja! Call Baban, Shaban and Raja! Are you scared? Are you scared? I have just come here to tell you that the evil eye.. ..has come on your brain, on your brain. And tomorrow this brain will blast. It will blast! Best of luck. "Is your kiss poison or love?" "Your kiss is like a passion." "Is your kiss poison or love?" "Your kiss is like a passion."

How is this possible? The same smell, the same fragrance.. ..the same biting on lips like animals! No! He'll kill me! He'll kill us! He'll kill us, Amit! He'll kill us! No, take me away from here! Take me away from here, Amit! Take me away from here, Amit! Take me away..- Yes. Madam, can I go home? Yes, you can go. Go. This is definitely Kekada's plan. We'll go and meet dad tomorrow, Sunita. Everything will be all right. Whose phone it might be? Please go and see. - Yes. Yes? This is Lallu speaking, your dear Lallu! Shut up! Why are you getting angry? I have taken the measurement of your neck long back. Even the rope is ready now. - Stop your nonsense! It's 11' o clock, Amit brother, I'll be there in 15 minutes.. ..and then your journey to death will begin. Good bye! Hello! Hello! Listen to me! Hello! No. Who was it? - It was him! Oh my God! What will we do now, Amit? He'll kill us! He'll kill us! Shut up, Sunita! Shut up! Let me think! Sunita, is there a gun in the house? Is there a gun in the house..- Yes! Go, get it! Wait! - What is it? There is something.. there is something on your back! What is it? Remove it fast! - There is something on your back. I..I have all ready come, Lallu. How did this come on my back? - Oh my God! This means..this means he's nearby. Come on Sunita. Come, let's see. Where is the gun? - Upstairs! let's go. It's not there! It's here. Where is the gun? Where is the gun, Sunita? There, in the cupboard! This is..this is a swindle! You..are not alive! I had murdered you! I had murdered you with my own hands! I had..I had thrown your dead body.. ..in the caves along with Kekada! Even..even your dead body had been burnt! You can't be alive! You can't be.. Yes! You are some plan of Kekada! You are some plan of Kekada! That bastard wanted more than a crore.. Go away! Go away! Thank you. Well done, inspector! Inspector! Which inspector? This.. Thank you, commissioner. You must have heard his crime. Mr. Amit, you are under arrest. Bring him. For what? For what? He is Lalluram, commissioner! You fool, I'm Lalluram, but people know.. ..me by inspector Vijay's name, got it? You'll understand very soon, come on. To hell with I.S.I. I'll deliver it in my own helicopter. I can even reach it to Islamabad if you want. Come in. Did you recognize me? Mr.Lallu, you were in heaven! Then how did you come over here? Kekada, I arrest you for the crime of my murder. What are you talking? Does somebody arrest.. ..anyone for the crime of his own murder? You cannot do that. Go. Careful, brother! Careful! If you throw me round and round like the wings.. ..of a helicopter, then the bones will start dancing. What is this? What happened, dear? Why are you.. ..hanging like a bat over here? Kekada, get me out of this snare! Even your father cannot get you out of my snare. Scream, dear. Scream! Where is my son? - Here comes your father.. Where is he? Amit! Amit! - Dad! Remove him down! Make him straight! First I'll make you straight, and then him. You will make me straight! Me! Don't shout! This is not your justice temple, but.. ..it is the torture room of this dirty insect from the gutter. What do you mean? - I'll explain. Don't hit him! Don't hit him! Don't hit him!.. Amit! Amit! Don't hit him! Don't hit my son. He was the one, who got one slap from.. ..Gomti aunty and could not tolerate it..- No! who beat my brother to death! He was the one.. - No! Now see what I'll do to him. No! No! Don't beat my son! Don't beat my son! Don't beat!.. ..Don't beat my !.. ..Don't beat my son.. Stop it, no! - Move. He has gone unconscious. He has fainted. Constable..- Yes sir. Open him. The matter is quiet sentimental. Uncle, what is the matter? Who gave you the suggestion of murdering Lallu? I created the circumstances. The decision was Amit's, but.. Madam, but Lallu so not dead. This is Lallu. He is Lallu. - What? He's not dead! He..he is Lallu! I used my brains, Thakur, I used my brains. There is a lot of power in it. I didn't understand what the matter is, at all, uncle! Thakur, you know very well that I had a twin brother.. ..who got drowned in the river Ganga. All thought that he was dead, but Dr. Pashupatinath saved him. He reached Jamnadas sir's house.. ..and then these people killed him. What nonsense are you talking, inspector? Ajay cannot be alive. Why? Why can't he be alive? Because inspector, we both know very well.. ..that while rapping Gomti, he.. - Amar Singh! You scoundrel! You rascal! You bastard! I'm that Gomti's daughter, rascal! Yes, I'm that Gomti's daughter.. ..and we have played this game together! But madam, from when are you in Lallu's side? I'll tell you. After lawyer sir announced the will.. ..I asked everyone to leave the room. Mr.Kekada, please leave. - I am going. Dad! You.. Not so hard, dear. He's not in coma.. ..but he has got a heart attack. Sunita, I am not Lallu. I am Vijay. I'm the second son of Gowardhan uncle. My brother Ajay and Gomti aunty.. ..didn't get drown in river Ganga and die. They had been murdered. Gomti aunty had asked me to promise her not to.. ..tell you anything about her troublesome life.. ..but when uncle's life came into trouble.. ..then I had to open this secret in front of everyone. I wanted to take revenge from Amar Singh.. ..and that is why I had to become Lallu.. ..and this drama of coma was a part of that plan. From now on you're not alone. I'm with you. After that my work became very simple. Whatever I wanted, it happened accordingly. After that my singing, dancing, Vijay fainting.. ..looking at him and shouting in the night club.. ..all this was a plan, such a plan.. ..in which all 3 of you are tangled. You have played a very insightful game, inspector.. ..but you still did not use your brain. There is a lot of power in it, lot of power. Think, even this girl is equally delinquent as Amit is. How will the law bail her? It's a very simple way, by making her the witness. Because I will lie In the court. Such a lie, that even your forefathers.. ..won't be able to prove it a lie. I see. What will you say in the court? Judge-sir, I have murdered Lallu. Amit and I together have done it. Even though Sunita has surrendered, but your honour.. ..you know very well that the law needs a lot of evidence.. ..and to collect the evidence, we played a drama in the hotel,.. ..and we also played a game to scare him in the bungalow,.. ..and we did that entire drama in the presence.. ..of police commissioner so that no one.. ..can point their finger on us in future. And, your honour, if Sunita hadn't helped us, then we.. ..wouldn't have been able to collect so many evidences. Wow! So many evidences! Then we have to agree, my Lord that Ajay was Lallu.. ..and he was killed in the bungalow itself. Until now the court has noticed only one witness.. ..my Lord, but the other witness.. ..is ex-inspector Kekada. And he is saying something else about Lallu's murder. If you permit, then let us hear his statement also. Listen, inspector. What does he want to say? Judge-sir, this madam was Lallu's wife, but she loved Amit. The night Lallu died, I, senior inspector Kekada.. ..batch number 616200, was on duty at Barrier. First Amit and Sunita went towards the bungalow. After sometime, even Lallu appeared over.. ..there and went towards the bungalow. I understood that there is definitely going to.. ..be some kind of hustle and bustle in the bungalow. Even I went straight to the bungalow. I put my eye in the key hole and saw that the 3.. ..were standing in the balcony and the 3 were quarrelling. Lallu was in a very dangerous mood! In anger, he jumped to beat Sunita.. ..and he slipped and we fell down the stairs. I rang the bell exactly at that time. These 2 had to open the door, and as soon as they saw me.. ..these fellows got scared, sorry, that fellow and this lady. Then? As soon as they saw police in the house, they fell into my.. ..feet and started pleading that we haven't murdered Lallu! We haven't murdered Lallu! We haven't murdered Lallu! I knew they had not killed him, but then too I didn't.. ..agree with them even though I knew what the truth was. Why would I agree when the plan of earning.. ..a lot of money had come into my mind? I clearly told them that give me 1 crore, or go to jail. They got scared and the deal was done. After that we kept the dead body in the fridge for some time. After that we put the body in the car, and then we threw.. ..the car in water so that we can prove it an accident later. I had just taken the bribe, sir, and that is.. ..taken by everyone now-a-days! Order! Order! The case is clear like a mirror, my Lord. The criminals are blamed not for the murder, but.. ..to get rid of Lallu's corpse after his accidental death. For this, they can be given any minor punishment.. ..but not the punishment of hanging to death. Your honour, I would like to have your permission.. ..to ask some questions to Mr. Kekada. Permission granted. Thank you, your honour. Mr.Kekada, I haven't seen a bigger fool than you in my life. You should have seen the mirror, sir. That I will show you later. So, Amit and Sunita haven't murdered Lallu, have they? Correct. - He fell down from the stairs and died. Should I wrote it on a stamp paper and give me? No! There is no need for this. Even you agree with it, don't you? - Yes. When he fell from the stairs, did he die.. ..at that very moment, or did he quiver? When a man falls from so many stairs.. ..then he will indeed quiver! Yes! He will indeed quiver. A 6 feet man like me, a strong built.. ..young man will indeed quiver. Do you agree also? - Yes, he quivered. This means before the door bell rang, he was alive. Who opened the door? Sunita..- Yes, Sunita. Did you come in? - 100 percent! 100 percent! Did you check his nerves? - Nerves..no. Mr.Kekada, did you check his nerves? We didn't have so much time, sir. This means he died inside the refrigerator. Murder! It is a murder! And the murderer is the one who.. ..put him inside the refrigerator. Did you put him inside the refrigerator? Me..no.. I didn't put him in the fridge. So Kekada must have put him. Yes! Kekada had put him inside the fridge..- Right! Amit! - Hey you! Uncle's spoilt son! I'll kill you! You both bloody father and son are planning to slaughter me! I won't remain quiet! Judge-sir! Judge-sir, Amit and Sunita have murdered Lallu. I had lied about that falling from the stairs matter! I had lied..- That's all, your honour, that's all.. Whatever lawyer sir's witness said, form that it is.. ..clearly proved that whatever Sunita said was right. This is a murder, and you very well know what the.. ..punishment for murder is, hanging to death. That's all, your honour. Your honour, because this case is clear like a mirror.. ..you can leave Mr. Kekada and Sunita on bail.. ..but I would like to take Amit on remand. I object, your honour. I want to inquire something regarding the case. Granted. Sunita, what happened? What's the matter, Sunita? I'm scared, Vijay. - Scared! Why? Our victory is confirmed. We will definitely win. No, that's not the matter. Even Goddess Sita had to give the fire test. If, someday, because of Amit you.. Sunita! Sunita! Sunita! Sunita, listen to me! You're mad! Look, like Lord Ram had faith.. ..in Goddess Sita, even I have faith in you. Don't you trust me? I trust you, but I don't trust my destiny. I'll die if I separate from you, Vijay! I'll die! I promise to love you in all births of mine. But, on one condition. Which condition? You have to give me a sweet kiss right here, right now. No! Not now! Now, now, now! Right now! Move. Sunita, listen to me! "You innocent girl, open the windows of love in your heart." "You innocent girl, open the windows of love in your heart." "No, no, not now, not now, darling." "Don't tease me like that, I get scared." "You innocent girl, open the windows of love in your heart." "No, no, not now, not now, darling." "Don't tease me like that, I get scared." "You innocent girl.." "The sky is on top, and you are down, darling." "Is your love a reality or a dream?" "The sky is on top, and you are down, darling." "Is your love a reality or a dream?"

"You innocent girl, open the windows of love in your heart." "No, no, not now, not now, darling." "Don't tease me like that, I get scared." "You innocent girl.." "Your sparkling body is shining like.. ..how the sun shines in the monsoon." "Your sparkling body is shining like.. ..how the sun shines in the monsoon." "The atmosphere is very nice, you are the fragrance." "Only you are in my heart." "I haven't stolen anything, I have fallen in love." "You stole my heart and gave me your heart." "You innocent girl, open the windows of love in your heart." "No, no, not now, not now, darling." "Don't tease me like that, I get scared." "You innocent girl.." Uncle, what's the matter? See the benefit of using the brains, come on, Kekada. Hello, sir! Hello! You are indeed a monument.. ..which is kept in the museum! Shake hands at least, sir! Ok tell me how did you think of a.. ..brain-storming plan of your own murder? The lion of the jungle of law and the invincible. Amar Singh, invincible is one who proves a lie as the truth.. ..but you have to prove the truth as the truth. Even if you know the A, B, C of law.. ..then prove that I'm Lallu. Here are the orders of the court. I want to meet Amit. Meet him, sir, meet him, may be.. ..this will be your last meeting with him. Constable, open the door for sir. Can I get a photograph of your brains? Come, Kekada, come. I am coming, uncle, I am coming. Dad! Please save me, dad! Please.. I don't want to die, dad! Please I don't want to die! - Don't worry, dear, your enemies will die. But you have to leave the country right now. - Yes! Yes!.. And that hungry lion who is sitting.. ..outside to eat him will fall asleep or what? Just wait and watch. There is a lot of power in this. ..Leave him! Leave.. ..Move! Wow uncle! The first part of the plan is successful. The second part will also be successful. Bastards! Quickly remove your clothes and wear Kekada's clothes. Remove his clothes quickly. We have to go to the old airport. The plane is waiting. Quickly. Leave him.. Leave him..Leave him.. You. Thank you for your sacrifice, Mr.Kekada. My son's life is in your death. Shut up! Shut up! It is very difficult to recognize a burnt corpse. Uncle.. Help! Save my son! My son has caught fire! Save my son! Friend, you saved my life! You are the biggest winner. That bastard uncle burnt me and ran away. Where did he go? Kekada, where did he go? He has gone to the old airport. Don't leave him! Kill him! - Yes. Call the ambulance quickly. - Yes sir. My lord! My lord, I'm finished! I am finished! Sir, I want justice! I want justice, sir, I want justice! What happened Mr. Amar..- What happened? Sir, there is no justice left in this country! That police officer burnt my son.. ..before the case could get over! He burnt my son and killed him! He killed my son, sir! I want justice, sir! I want justice! Inquire what the truth is. Yes, your honour. "Player.." "The biggest player." My lord, this is true that the police station caught fire.. ..and that.. - Inspector has burnt it, sir. He should be called in this temple of justice.. ..and the case of Amit's murder should.. ..start and he should be hanged to death. Inspector! Come! Come up. Bring it down fast! Bring fast! Pilot, take it a little down, a little down. Take it down! Take it down! Come. Come, come up. Follow him! Follow him! "Player.." "The biggest player." "Player." Take it down. Take it down. Take it towards the car, pilot. "The biggest player." Faster! Faster! Take it on top of him. Sir, commissioner sir is trying to trace.. ..but we cannot find out where inspector sir is. Tell him that if he is not presented in 10 minutes.. ..then the case of Lallu's murder will be dismissed.. ..and inspector Vijay will be considered.. ..as Amit's murderer. Yes sir. Come on! You swine! I'll kill you, you scoundrel! Where are you running away, bastard? I'm the father of all you bastards! Kekada won't let you run away! "Player.." "The biggest player." 10 minutes are all ready over, my lord. He is still not come. - The case should be dismissed. Yes, write the order. Help! Help! Dad, save me! Dad..he.. he'll kill me.. Mr. Amar Singh, what is all this? You were saying that your son.. - I'll tell you, my lord. Amar Singh tried to implicate me in the murder of Amit.. ..and he played such a game.. he played such a.. ..game in which Kekada was made the scrap goat. These 3 came to the police station today morning. After listening to the statement of inspector Vijay.. ..the court has come to a decision that.. ..Amit and Sunita have murdered Lallu together. Because Sunita became the witness.. ..the court releases her and Amit should be hanged. Wait, your honour, wait. What is it now? Judge-sir..judge-sir, my entire life is spent in fighting cases.. ..but I have never fought, seen or even heard such a case. This..this dangerous man wants to get my.. ..son hanged in the crime of his own murder! What do you mean? - He was the one who went to Das's house as Lallu. This Sunita trapped my son in her love and this Mr. Das.. ..Mr. Das did the drama of going into coma. These 3 played such a game, such a game, my lord, that.. ..poor Amit started considering himself as Lallu's murderer. How can you say this so confidently? - Because I know. What do you know? What do you know? That Lallu didn't get drown in river Ganga. I killed him! I killed him with my own hands! Then how can he reach to the bungalow? Remember Thakur, in a similar court.. ..in front of this judge, the decision was.. ..made that you haven't murdered Ajay. You haven't raped Gomti. That was a false decision, my lord! The truth is that I murdered Ajay with my own hands! ..Rub your nose! Rub your nose! Beg! Beg for your son! But nothing can happen.. ..because law asks for evidence. Prove, if you can, that you have murdered Ajay. All the evidences are burnt! They are burnt! If my son dies, then even you will die! Inspector Vijay, what is going on? Your honour, he tried to shoot me in front of the court. In the case of 307, a case should be opened on this man. Arrest him! Take this brain worm. How many people will you hang.. ..in the crime of your own murder?.. Judge-sir! Judge-sir, I haven't done the murder! Judge-sir, I haven't done the murder! Judge-sir, I haven't done the murder! Judge-sir! "You innocent girl, open the windows of love in your heart." "No, no, not now, not now, darling." "Don't tease me like that, I get scared." "You innocent girl.."
