We didn't know how to turn on the cameras. - Want to meet the cast? - Yes. In the role of Jim, the rising politician, is a man with a career amazing on stage and screen.

Nice to meet you." Hello. My name is Cicely. Great pleasure. No no. My name is Cicely. Is it Cicely now? So I'm Jim? - They won't believe it. - What? No no. - Can't I be myself? - No, no way. - You're from Liverpool. - Blackpool. Either way, he won't notice anything. Maybe it's best not to talk. It just makes noises. Not this one. Go to the kitchen prepare the antipasto. The who? Hello. Here she is. The hostess full of eagerness. Rays! I mean... Damn! Ready. To positions. We have to repeat. We have to repeat. He says we have to repeat. Sorry. should have squandered and hired an actress. Tell Sophie Straw not to hit the camera. Enjoy yourself. Just this? I'm starving. Please. You can almost fill your mouth. Damn the public! They could have laughed more. It is free. They take a while to warm up. It doesn't take long for you to say that you laugh inside. Didn't help Sophie want to hit the camera. They laughed a lot about it. Sophie? Den, what did Ted Sargent say? He is not here. used to peek if the show goes well. Then that's it. We're screwed. Ted Sargent hated it. Calm down. He didn't say anything at all. Congratulations! You were great. You even upstaged Clive. It wasn't on purpose. Thanks for saving me. Here. - He believes they are the future. - Thanks. Goodbye. Sophie? We're at the bar. Sorry, Dennis. I can not stay. Today did a good job. Did Ted Sargent like it? parties. Is everything okay, Sophie? My dad was admitted yesterday and I... My God. I have to catch the last train do not go... Do not go... Can I do something? Don't worry about the program. Bon voyage. I'll tell you how it went. PEOPLE AND PLACES His Highness appeared, did it? The girl who had more to do than to come see the dying father? Dying? I had a heart attack. I already told dad I'm sorry not have come before. It's good that you have an excuse. She will appear on television. And I have a tail. Aunt Marie, I've been working in a television comedy. If you had come yesterday, missed the opportunity. Is this another one of your stories, Barbara? Like when you said your mother was abducted by aliens? Did you record the program? Worth it? My father is sick. I just came to pay his bill. Tell Mr. Parker that's on the house. Thanks. We could have had it all. We were great. King and Queen of Blackpool. Then. Captain Smythe was represented by... - Clive Richardson! - Clive Richardson! You two and the radio. - Marie, get some rest. - I don't have bits. The pension is a disgrace after the Scottish family left. I swear they had rabbits with them. There was food on the floor. I can't believe our Barbara will appear on television. Do you want the blanket, dad? Yes, force. It is free. Well, he looks a lot better. - When does he go back to work? - Don't come back. He won't come back. It's a risk. It's tough, but that's how it is. Aunt Marie, no. I know you think it's my fault. It's not ideal, but he is not well since your mother tore it apart. It was a big scare. Big scare. Come here. I do not know what to do. He's sick and you're gone. I'm very busy and I can't split myself in two. - It's okay, Aunt Marie. - No. Have some tea. My London adventure is over. I went back. Here. It has many leaves, it tastes bad. Barbarian. Don't use those bowls, Bill. Sorry. They are a family heirloom. How chic. I just inherited acne. I hope you enjoy the show, Edith. There's nothing left to do. The show will premiere... Now. Why would not you like it? Let's be honest, Edith. Comedy is not your style. Nonsense. Edith has a great sense of humour. What were you laughing at the other day? When you said the wrong word "embourgeoisement". Then. Then. Will start? What it was? It's a special occasion. Cicely. Cicely, my dear, why? What is the problem? It's our Barbara. Creed! My face is all disfigured. Jim? Can I rub it on her offal? It just makes noises. Not this one. Go to the kitchen prepare the antipasto. The who? Just this? I'm starving. Please. You can almost fill your mouth. I could have sworn I got more laughs. We used the second take. The audience is quieter. They wore the one from when Sophie hit the camera. Go for a walk. I don't need her laughs. You have to give me this recipe. Let's go. It's so nice to see a young couple so in love. - It's your name. - The stage name. Very professional. Very well dear. The kisses and hugs at the end leave me behind. You're not married, are you? Jim and Barbara. That's the point. It's modern. Maybe we can open the good bottle. - Let's use the celebration one. - Good... we should enjoy because it must be a unique occasion. Come what may, darling, you made us proud. What do you think, Den? Ted gives us a season? I think he will wait first by the criticisms. If you don't give us a program, screw it. He's the loser. They will give me a role in a movie with Julie Christie. We are trying do something different. Bet on us. The episode was the bet. We are a television channel, we are not an experimental theater group. Tony and Bill they're not just writing a comedy about a couple who fall in love. They are challenging the norms. They are defying, according to the press. Reviews are weak. Yes, but everyone agrees regarding Sophie Straw. "In feeble effort in all else, etc..." "We'll keep an eye out on newcomer Sophie Straw." She should have been careful with what she did. the first rule is not to go against the furniture or the cameras. Yes, but she managed to laugh. The other actors would have cried. It's raw, but it builds connection with the audience. She seems to have bonded with you. She is a find. Let me be the director. I know the value of this program. I am. 4758. Yes. Yes. Recovering. Thank you, Mr. Mahindra. Yes yes. Just a minute. Is there? Yes. He is well. I understand. Yes. Thanks for telling me. All good? It's better this way. You couldn't have continued. I'm so sorry, dear. Ted Sargent accepted. What? He accepted? We have your appointment for the week. We could go for a walk if you get good results. We need more potatoes. Yes. Listen to me, if you don't go to London right away to make the program, I swear I have another heart attack. - But we need her. - No, Marie. -George, she can't come and go as she wants. - Shut up. He is well? Yes. what needs to be done to get me a drink? - It's the Sophie Straw of television. - Hello, Dennis. It's good to see you. Jeez, Den! Shake her arm more to make your mouth water. Then. Sorry. Go. Tell me what's been going on. Good... We have good news. Ted wants the first show in six weeks. But there is bad news. Ted wants the first show in six weeks. we have the opportunity to do something original. - Yes. - Yes. We took a risk with the pilot episode. Now we can talk of anything we want. - Poverty and privileges. - Yes. Sexual revolution, gender inequality. Anything we want. Just thinking about it makes my gut churn. I need a cup. You have to follow. Drink this. No no. these thugs they don't know how to take care of a lady. I bring you a cocktail. Thank you, Clive. Ready. - What is this? - It's whiskey. It's good. - Good. - She did it. Yes Yes Yes. Do not forget... My God! - My God! Soph! - Disgusting. I've never seen... Can you speak softly? I'm kidding. My God! I didn't know you were here. I'm over there with the editorial team. - Hello. - Hello. Robbie. - Hello. I'm Sophie Straw. - Edith, wife of Dennis. - Congratulations! - Yes. Thanks. Thank you very much. - See you later, darling. - Yes. I'd say you owe me four whiskeys, two beers and a coke Yes, me... It's good to be back. Did you miss it? It says: "The newcomer, Sophie Straw, that looks like a mix of Brigitte Bardot and the common girl." Your new friend Diane seems to think you're a star. You didn't bring this for Diane, did you? Is it to bite or suck? I'd say it's a personal preference, Marjorie. Give me a hug. Let me. The first episode has to set the pace. As Den says, it has to be original, bold, challenge political power and be a satire. Then? Have you ever written innovative comedy? So far, Tony has a great idea. Barbara and Jim are a couple. - Admit it, it's a good idea. - It will only be receiving prizes. Here. We made a great couple, Den. Health! Jim might as well be gay. It was a good idea, wasn't it, Tone? The married homosexual. Bold and original. And Ted Sargent would fire us. Tony's right, but it's a good idea. Television is not ready yet. An evening with Val Doonican! The Old Irishman of Rock do you want to spend the night with me? He is 36 years old. Don't be conceited. An Evening with Val Doonican it's just the tv show most successful in issue. And they want you to go there. They have a great comedy idea. Val doesn't understand anything he says for being from Blackpool. And Sophie makes fun of him because of the Irish accent. Do we make fun of our accents? Yes. Bill and Tony would say which is cheap comedy. Tell that to Peter Sellers. While they write a season, I will plan your next step. Listen to this idea. We can tackle a topic with which many are faced on the wedding night, but that is not spoken of. - Constipation? - No, Tony. Sex. It's not what most people do. so they are alone? Damn! You're already revealing yourself, Den. What do you think, Tony? Barbara and Jim are married, but they didn't have sex. Will it be realistic? Bill. maybe one of them have a psychological problem. There's been talk of frigid women, Bill. I don't think it's the woman who has the problem. Interesting. Start writing, Tony. Listen. I don't say this to many of my girls, but there are career heights when the tide turns and pulls you mercilessly to her destiny, stardom. It happened to me and Patsy, although to a lesser extent, of course. Now it's happening to you. Keep the sails in the wind and cross your fingers. Hopefully it just got the green light. Green light! Green light. Until the end. Honey, Diane Lewis called. He wants to interview her again. I like Diane a lot, but i don't know what else to say to Cherry magazine. She no longer works at Cherry, she works at Nova. They promote it as "a new style magazine for a new style of woman." What's wrong with old style women? Forward. Diane wants to take you shopping. Yes, a relaxed setting, of "two girls having fun". With a photographer. Can you buy a dress to the Val Doonican. Can I accept? Patsy, call Val. Yes, fine. Is this where you worked? My mother shops here. - Beard. - Marj! - This is my roommate, Marjorie. - Hello. Marj, this is the photographer, Ari, and Diane. It's great to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Equally. I won't shake your hand. No no. I've been touching feet all day. They smell like sewage. Let's go. Hello. Hello. Yes, it's her. Hello? Excuse me. What's going on here? What are you doing here? You have to go to work. Madam, may I help you? Mrs. Sykes. How long. I see you didn't remove the badger. How am I? Perfect. You half-baked exhibitionist. Give it here. I mean it. Give it here. - Remove the... - What are you going to do? Say goodbye? No! He arrives. Security! Security. What are you doing? Don't touch... So what interviews do you do now? Divorce, careers, orgasms. Damn! this is very advanced for a girl from Blackpool. If you were an ordinary girl from Blackpool, you would still be there. This is it? For the Val Doonican Show tomorrow? Yes. Excellent. Your grandma would love it. Try this. It is better. Diane! It's all made with glitter. I was more covered with feathers at the Whiskey Cat Club. Go there. I dare you. our next guest enchanted the public in a comedy, on paper from the beautiful Barbara of Blackpool. Give it up for the lovely Sophie Straw. I'll get gas. Sardines. I think they're just fancy mullets. - I bought them at a delicatessen. - Where? New hair, chic mullets, wine instead of tea. - No. You changed. - You're right. I really changed. Give it up for the lovely Sophie Straw. Let's go. Sophie, meet Mr. Magic. - Hello. - What a cutie. My God! Couldn't afford the rest of the dress? I am a magician, but it will take a miracle keep that dress in place. It'll be fine as long as I don't sneeze. Does anyone have pepper? Pepper? Salt? It's already peppered enough. He guesses. I'm interviewing Jacob Bronowski. Vernon won't let go of me comThe Identity of Man. Then. Sorry. It doesn't matter. Go back to your dumb blonde on the TV show. She's not stupid, actually. And she's not blonde, actually. Today we have special guests. Roy Target and Chuffy. Low blow. Sorry. It doesn't even look like you. I don't usually feel threatened. No! Fan Mail. Got fan mail? A letter. When I represented Diana Dors, she received full bags every day. Damn! By the way, Mr. Magic called, honey. was very impressed with you noVal Doonican Show. He also impressed me. His breath smelled like eggnog. He loved hanging out with you. No. All good. Let's decline politely. There must be more young stars wanting to go to the Vaults of St. James. I hear it's the best disco. Maybe check my schedule. Put on the sunglasses. You will go blind. Jimmy, rock. Sorry, not on the list. I'm Mr. Magic. It's not on the list. - It usually works. - Johnny. Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! - My God! Sophie! - Diane! I don't know what list this is, but we are not there. - Ron, honey. They are with me. - Yes. Do you give me this honor? Of course, I came up with the trick of the missing bra. I remove it only with the power of my mind. Want a demo? If you have a dress. Hello. Who's that? Johnny. He's drunk, but he wants to say hello. Then. Hello. Sorry. - Balls! - Everything is fine. Excuse me. Hello dear. - We have already met? - I don't think so, dear. I saw you dancing with your grandfather. - What did he say? What did you say? - That you can dance. Then. And that's good? - Yes. - It is good. Thanks. It's Mr. Television Magic. Then it should make itself disappear. - Back to 1952. - Choose a card. We're all going to a party. Leave him and come with me. - I should be in bed by now. - I have something to wake you up. Don't tell me what the letter is. I cover my eyes. Smells. No. Sorry. Hell! - What the hell are you doing? - Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. And how why... Show your magic wand. It will bug. - Let's go. - No. Very good. Why? Sorry I'm late. I caught a jump on a hatch. She never disappoints. Congratulations on the Doonican program! Congratulations, Soph! - Hello, Sophie. - Hello, Dennis. What the hell, Clive? Don't you know you smell the script? Hancock did the same to rate the comedy level. - You smell weird. - Go away. It's Brut by Faberge. More cheating, from the toilet. I think you smell good. - Are you five? - Yes, you have to go take a nap. - Why don't we start? - Yes. Ready. Episode one, Private Problems. Take a kick. Very good. We have the revelation. And I shake my head. Could be more... It has to be dramatic. Not in the face. It is good? The door is not serious. - Jeez! - Ready. I am fine. Very good. Then Barbara and Jim are in bed and come out from under the sheets. "Flaccid like spaghetti."? You mean that... Will you say I'm powerless? We are implying... Barbara is sexually experienced. - Is it troublesome, Soph? - What the hell! My father, Aunt Marie and the neighbors will be watching. Explain to your family that the program is not real. I don't think they understand because Barbara is from Blackpool and i'm from blackpool and her name is Barbara and my name is Barbara. It's confuse. AND. Is her name Barbara? It called. - What? When? - When? Until the day they met me. Why didn't I say anything? when did we call the character Barbara? I didn't know I could. Sorry. Sorry dear. Can we stop and talk about me for a second? we are saying that I can't lift it? Now it's you. Jim is not real. Yes, Jim can't lift it. - Have I ever lifted it? - In our universe, no. Ready. So am I a virgin? Nobody will believe. Look at me. Then? Hell! That should be on your tombstone. "Clive Richardson, Too handsome to be a virgin." your character have a psychological block. I can sue you for this. Slander, insult. Must give. I was going to court just to see that. We want it to be real for the audience. Many couples have problems. - I don't have. - But it's not you, it's Jim. Perhaps Beard will be upset and think it's her fault. No, this is much more realistic. - Thanks. - Why would it be her fault? she is not responsible for your hydraulic failure. Creed! Is that what hydraulic failure means? He has problems with the doorknob. It's from the head. It's psychological. - I like. It's modern. - Of course you do. You don't have erectile dysfunction. I like that Jim is upset. Show you are not afraid to show emotions. I think it is... ... sensual in a man. AND? What happens next? He cannot remain limp. What's the solution? With my ex, it was potatoes and an egg. Ready. Let's deal with it. You can go to lunch. Pay for production. Tony and Bill, back to the typewriter. May I, dear? Yes. I heard about this restaurant. Isn't Mick Jagger coming over here? Perhaps. Never noticed. I can't believe they let us in. Thanks. When I went to the disco with Mr. magic, were not interested and he's a familiar face. It's another known hoax. Thanks. Actually, he's not Clive Richardson. I'm kidding. Don't look, but it's there to Terence Stamp and The Shrimp. My God! She is beautiful. It didn't do too badly in the department either. of beauty. Nor Clive. Therefore... We were watching the sunset and the boat rocked. Really was... Let's toast to the television lovebirds. - Thank you, Mario. - Thanks. Health, dear! Put it down. Delicious. It seems that everyone looks at us, Sophie Straw. What if we give them something to talk about? Follow my cue. You know Sophie... I've never met anyone like Sophie. Northern? - Who's in charge here? - You. I hope there are no complaints. You won't mistake Clive for poor Jim and his limp spaghetti. No way. What do you think others will say? They don't have to know this. Dennis doesn't like it very much of contacts between the cast. In what sense? No. It was just something I heard. Jim! My God! I think I preferred hydraulic failure. - I can't keep up. - I'll accompany you both. I'm imagining? The chemistry today is very good. They ate each other.
