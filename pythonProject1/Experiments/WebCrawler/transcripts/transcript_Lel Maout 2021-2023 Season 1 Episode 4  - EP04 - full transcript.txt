I promise you, nothing will keep us apart, till the day we die. -Till the day we die? -Till the day we die. EPISODE 4 How do you find marriage? Is it nice? Are you happy? It is perfect, the best thing I've ever done. I advise you to do that, in case you're not married, ma'am. I'm single, I didn't get married. I don't think I'll ever do it. Impossible. -Do you know why? -Why? Because marriage is a failure, it's a big failure. All men are the same, as if they are cut from the same cloth.. You can't generalize. My husband is a great man. Good to hear. Where is your husband now? -At work. -I am here for business, too. But there is a mean woman who's not letting me do my work properly. And I'm this mean woman for sure. Good thing you know yourself, Reem. What brought you here? That wasn't our agreement. What brought you here? What got into your head and brought you here? Just look at me now, and answer me right away! I came to cancel everything. Cancel everything? You're really cute. How cute you are when you make a personal decision! What do you mean, cancel everything? It means I don't want anymore. I don't want anymore. Do you need me to sign on a receipt for you to understand? I felt from the beginning that something was wrong. This thing needed two months, and you've been training for six months. Your phone calls to him when we are dining together. Your coming here and your phone being unavailable when I try to call you. I've said to myself, "There is something wrong." Why him? Why him among all the men we dated? Why this silence? Answer! Because I fell in love with him. I fell in love with him. Do you know what that means? You surely don't know since you are heartless. You don't know what love is. And do you know how to love? Now I know. After I got married to him. You didn't get married to fall in love with him? And I fell in love with him, what can I do? What can I do? You go on with the plan as agreed. I can't, I can't, Sahar. Why can't you understand me? -I love him, and he loves me too. -He loves you? What a stupid love this is, my little one! Since he loves you, why did he spend two days with me? Wake up, you idiot. Just wake up. I gave you the chance to be together. I pushed him to hate me and be away from me. Hadi doesn't love you. Understand that. He loves the girl you portrayed to him. The deceitful image. The classy, polite, good family girl. But if he knows the truth, will he still love you, Wejdan? Don't call me Wejdan. Oh, yes, I'll call you Wejdan. I want to remind you who you are because it seems you forgot. Just understand that he doesn't love you. No one can possibly love someone like you or me. Reem... you and me only have each other. Do you remember? Do you remember the agreement and the promise we made to each other? Do you recall? How much is one kilogram of tomatoes, Mr. Abdallah? It is 6,000. That's too expensive, sell it at 5,000. -Four thousand, nothing lasts forever. -God bless you. -Mr. Abdallah? -Yes, dear. -I have to leave. -Where are you going? I told you, I'll be seeing Lamees. But you've put on a lot of perfume. Next time, just spray twice. When you exceed the limit with perfume, the lady flees away. -Wait, take this. -No, no, Uncle Abdallah. Listen, don't make her think you're stingy. Women hate men like that. -I'll deduct it from your salary later. -Okay then. -Shit. -I'm sorry. What have you done? I'll beat you. -I'm sorry. -Just go. -Can I go? -Yes, go. -Loulou? -Yes? Take care of the store, I have to change my clothes. No worries. Julia... -Thank you. -You're welcome. Tonight, we're both going back to Beirut. We will each go our own way and move on with our lives. But I wish you could pass by me for five minutes, just for one last time. Please, I'll be waiting for you. Why don't you want to understand that I'm not against you? If I had an ounce of hope that Hadi might love you, I'd have aborted the plan and left. But Hadi doesn't love you, you creature. He doesn't love you. Understand that, you idiot! Listen very carefully. You only find it hard because this is the first time you fell in love. But later, you'll get used to it. You'll find it easy. Get used to what? To becoming strong and not being so emotional. Or, at least, knowing how to control your emotions. Who even told you that I want to control my emotions? I don't want that, Sahar. Let me have the family I dream of with him. I'm your family, Reem. I'm your mum who abandoned you and left you at the orphanage's door. I'm your dad, whom you don't even know. I'm your sister, that is, if you even have one. I'm the one who took care of you and who helped you grow up. I'm the one who laughed and cried with you. I'm the one who took you out from the misery you were living in. I'm your only family. Reem? I know that you're mad at me and I've ruined everything. But I have my own reasons. All weak people are alike. They invent excuses to justify their mistakes. I was sure that you wouldn't understand me. I know you very well. Yes, you're right. You know me. That's why you know very well that I always keep my promises. Unlike you. I promised you we'd be like sisters and stick by each other. I'm keeping this promise. Sisters don't stab each other in the back. You're the only person I trust in this world. But you turned out to be deceitful and you've abandoned me. -I didn't let you down. -What else? I knew you'd come. What time is your flight? At 6:00, why? Is there a possibility you can postpone? -Why would I postpone? -You have to. Hadi? Why would I postpone? Because you, my wife and I are on the same plane. The trip will be really comfortable. Do you know why your trip won't be comfortable? Because when you'll see me, you'll be confused. Do you know why you'll be confused? Because our feelings are mutual. Hadi, I cannot stop thinking about you. I can't forget everything that happened between us. Here, in our bed, at our parties. Everything wonderful that happened. Sahar, I beg you. This feeling I had for you, I've never had with anyone else. Sahar, we had some nice moments and they are over. No, they are not over, they are not over. Don't lie to me and to yourself. My wife and I want to open a new page. Even if you open one hundred pages, you will get to a dead end. Do you know why? Because she doesn't love you. She doesn't love you like I do, Hadi. There's more to it than that. There's more to it. She had a problem. She can't have children. That's why I apologize. I'm really sorry. Reem? So, my little one? Nice one that you can't have children. But knowing that you got pregnant because of your recklessness while young, I would have believed that you can't have children. Bravo, bravo. -Why are you late? -I was in the sauna. I will go take a shower. Have a good shower. I told you that you can't beat me. I've taken a decision not to lose at anything. We can't always control losing or winning. Sometimes, luck has a role to play. You're mistaken, my friend. In my opinion, there's no such thing as luck. Luck is in the mind, if you will. If you think well, your luck improves. If you think in a bad way, then you face misfortune. I'm talking out of experience. What happened about the house? Did you talk to that girl? Yes, I've talked to her, and there are many options. What about we go see them tomorrow? I wish. I can't stay at Hadi's anymore. I want to respect his privacy with Reem because their relationship is on the edge. If that's the reason, well, then I think you should stay at your brother's. Nothing will change. Take it from me, because your sister-in-law... is a disaster. Why do you hate her so much? Don't say you're not at ease with her, because I feel that it's personal. What's the deal? What's your problem with her? There's a big problem with her, all but good deeds. What has she done to you? To me? Nothing at all. She has done wrong to your brother. What do you say we both go get them at the airport tonight? Yes, why not? Is something wrong, dear? No, dear, everything's okay. What do you say we postpone our flight for a few days? I'd like us to spend some time together. My love... It is a bit hard, my love. I have a very important meeting in Beirut on Monday. So we get back before Monday. But we move to another hotel because I didn't like this one. Please, say yes, please. Let me see what I can do about it. Sonia, change my flight booking to the day after tomorrow. For Reem and I, as well as the hotel. Whatever you want. Thank you. It's Omar. You know that you have no ethics at all. Why is it so? Why in your opinion? Think about it. Haven't I told you that I love you? Not once? -Not even a bit? -Never. We had so much fun today. Let me get off here, so that no one in the neighborhood sees us. Lamees, stop right there. -He's dropping you off. -No, he's not. Wait for me right there. How much do you want? Two thousand five hundred. -Please, Mum, take it easy. -Why were you with him, you idiot? He saw me on the road and he offered to drop me off. I had good intentions, that's all. Do you have good intentions? -Listen, well, you see this? -Mum, don't embarrass us. If I ever see you with my daughter again, I'll make you eat this forcefully. We'll talk later. -Sariah, Sariah. -Go on, walk. Calm down, what are you doing to your daughter, Sariah? Go take care of your daughters who come back home after midnight. Shame on you! Before talking about other people's daughters, you behave well! Listen, Abdallah, if you don't take care of this long-haired guy who works for you, I'll be unstoppable. -Shame on you, I'll give you a beating! -Go away! Shame on you! Have you lost your mind? Why didn't you drop her off far away so that she could have walked? Did you need to get her over here, you crazy? I'll give him a beating! Go, get in there. If as much as a cockroach jumps, then I'll know why. Mum, he only proposed to drop me off, no more, no less. No more, no less? Okay then, and listen well, Lamees. I didn't raise you to get married to a poor, useless man. Do you like being poor? Listen carefully. I don't want my daughter's husband to be jobless, and I have to provide him with shelter and food, like I did with your dad. I've told you many times, this Rasheed is useless. Do you understand? Listen, you idiot, I swear to God, if I see you looking at him or talking to him, I'll never let you back here again, nor will you go to school. Go to your room, right away! Don't let me see your face again! Hello? I've got word that you're going to postpone your flight and move to another hotel. You've certainly got word from Sonia, right? Well, listen to what I have to say. You'll go back to Beirut this very instant. Otherwise, I swear I'll turn the table over on both you and I. You know very well that when Sahar talks, she executes. Who called, my love? The reception, asking if the luggage is ready. Yes, Sonia? No places? On another airline, if possible. Anything. You might find something. I'll wait for your call, bye. She says there are no places. No problem. No need for the fuss, we'll get back tonight. My love, you said you wanted us to spend two more days here. I didn't want to that badly. So if there's a problem, let's forget about it. Anyways, I've missed Beirut, our house and our bedroom. Whatever you say. What a relief! We're finally home. My love, who asked Omar to come pick us up from the airport? I asked him to. Is there a problem? The problem is that you know I don't like him. I feel he's not honest and he hates me. Please, don't give him any details about our life. It's clear that you've told him everything. But, my love, Omar is my only friend. He's the only person whom I tell everything to blow off steam. Tell me everything. I'm your wife. I've tried a lot. I've tried a lot, but you refused, or have you forgotten? Before I forget, have I told you that I love you today? No, you told me so in Turkey. -Turkey? -Yes. -I'm truly a man with no ethics. -Very much so. I love you. Me too. Raouf. -What do you want, Amine? -How are you, Nadia? -I am okay. -Where's Raouf? -Inside. -Call him, please. -Raouf, someone's here for you. -Coming! Coming. Move away. -What's up? -Let's go so they don't hear us. -What's wrong? -Where are you going, Raouf? -I'll be back, go in. -May a wave knock you away. Why did you disappear? We are playing cards without you. I'm playing elsewhere. I found a place, my friend. It's a house as rich as a gold mine. Women and playing cards for real till the morning, and I'm winning money. Nice, it shows with this tiger print. Tell me, where and how? Do you have money? -How much exactly? -Three to four million. Three to four million? What are you saying? It's a month's salary. You may double and even triple the amount in one night. Okay then, we'll manage. Tomorrow, get ready. Wear a suit and some perfume and brush your hair backwards. Are we going for a card game or for a fashion show, Raouf? A suit is the way forward. That way, they'll think we're a big deal and make a good impression. You'll love these people. We're going to Yvonne's. What is it, Mrs. Yvonne? Go and take away the mule sitting there, and get him to your room. Fuck him! He'll win everything. I've tried, but he's not accepting. Sousou, try again your own way. He'll accept in the end, come on. Whatever you say. God bless you, you have great luck! This wretched old man! Take a card, come on. Welcome, you prince! I knew I'd see you. -How are you, Yvonne? -Thank God. Listen, it's crowded tonight, but I'll send away a client and you can... No, don't send anyone away. I've come today to talk about a matter. What, my dearest? Come in, my dearest, you've got me all worried now, come in. Tell me, what is it? I want Fifi. Fifi is booked for the night, she's with one client and has three others. -If you are patient enough to wait... -From now on, Fifi is mine only. She can't be with anyone else, deal? You want her exclusively for you? How naughty! How much will you pay? You don't want to take your clothes off? At least your pullover. No. Then, the shoes, relax your toes. Then, lie on the bed and let me massage you and you... No, no, I don't want anything, forget it. As you wish. And all that matters is that my clients are satisfied. But what's the deal with you? You don't want to take your clothes off, nor do you want to lie down, and you don't want to give a space to those who do it. What are you here for, bro? I am here to have a drink with you, talk and get some rest. Is it a problem? You're paying me to have a drink together and to talk? You're really weird, man! What do you care? Whatever you say. Cheers to the handsome man who pays me without overworking me. Don't you want to change your mind and lie down? My love. I promise you, I won't leave... neither there... nor here. GOODNIGHT YOU TOO Good morning, queen of ladies. Good morning. How are you, Mr. Abdallah? Thank God. This is the mujaddara platter, to which I added some vegetables. You didn't have to. What are you saying? This is to thank you. Okay then, do you need anything? Take care of yourself. -Mr. Abdallah? -Yes? I wanted to cook, but didn't know what. What do you feel like eating? Everything you cook is delicious. I'll prepare mloukhieh. You like it. I don't only like it, I adore it. Pardon me. Will you be late today? I don't think so, my love. What do you feel like eating for dinner tonight? Whatever you want. Go in, it's cold. -Take care. -Bye. -Good morning. -Good morning. How is the prettiest sister-in-law? -I'm fine. -Is he fine as well? -Thank God, all is great. -Perfect. Here's Omar. Welcome, Omar. Am I late? Not at all. -Bless you. How are you, Reem? -I'm fine, pardon me. -Go ahead. -So, should we move? No, I called her a little while back and she said they won't arrive until 12:00. Until 12:00? Come on, let's drink some coffee somewhere. No, we can drink it here if you want. No, I don't want to stay home, so let's go somewhere. -What is it? -So, Ramroum? We've taught you the job, now you're racing us. I'm a student of yours, Sahar. Come to my place, I want to see you. I want to see you, too. But I want to see Sahar, my sister and friend, to whom I talk about my worries. Not Sahar, the one I've been arguing with for a few days now. Sahar, with whom you are arguing, is your sister and friend. Who argues with you for your own interest. Are you home? I'll be waiting for you. Don't be late. Okay. Okay then, the princess is back. She's not only back, she slept in his bedroom. It means they are back together. Did something happen between them? Yes, but I won't give you any details in case you feel nauseous. You're so funny, Sariah. Do you think I was sleeping with them? When she sleeps back in his room, that means everything is okay. Take my word for it, she'll return to her old habits in two days' time. Sariah? Yes, Mrs. Reem, good morning. Get dinner ready for tonight. Is there something in particular you wish for, Mrs. Reem? Everything that Mr. Hadi likes. Whatever you and Mr. Hadi wish for. She is back forcefully, the lady. How did we even make it this far? We sit face-to-face without exchanging any word? If you were smart, you'd have known that I've told you many things when you came into the house. I know what you told me. What you're still telling me now through your eyes. I too know what you're telling me. -You don't know. -Oh, yes, I know. You're telling me that you didn't betray me or abandon me, and that you're a victim here, right? I can't understand why you are being so stubborn. Why are you refusing to understand me? Sahar, be sure that even if I don't want to go on with the plan, I won't abandon you. And I'm sure that you won't let me down. If I let you do what you're planning, I'll be hurting you. I'll then be letting you down, and I'm letting you hurt yourself. -I'm not hurting myself. -Yes, you are. When you fall in love with the wrong man... then you're hurting yourself. Hadi loves me the same way I love him. How are you convinced he loves you? How does he love you, you idiot, when he dated me? Think, my little one. Your brain is for use, not for decoration. I'm using my brain, unlike you, it seems. I've told you once before and I'll say it again. If it weren't for me, nothing would have happened. You're still an idiot even though I taught you everything. Okay then. Do you bet that after all the drama you caused him, telling him you can't have children... if I insist, he'll betray you again with me? In your dreams. For your information, all my dreams come true. Let me prove it to you. If I succeed, we'll go on with the plan as agreed. If not, I promise you, Reem, I won't stand in your way. Sahar? Yes, what else? Don't let me have an open war with you. If you think I'm at war with you, then you are really mistaken. I'm protecting you. So... do we go on with our plan? Or do I prove it to you and then we go on? You insist on war, it seems. I'm protecting you, Wejdan. Stop calling me Wejdan! She's dead! She's dead! Wejdan didn't die. Reem died. Hanane gave you her identity. Did you forget that? Did you forget why they sent Hanane away from the orphanage? You know what, Sahar? Great, do whatever you want. Prove to me that Hadi doesn't love me, and I'll prove the contrary. Deal. You're my sister and my sweetheart. But business is business. As they say, "In love and war, everything is permitted." True, everything is permitted. I buy. I sell. Feel comfortable at home. Feel at home. Don't tell me that you didn't like the house. It is very nice from the outside, but I'm looking for a smaller one. Let's see the inside first. Where's your friend? Isn't she a bit late? She's stuck in a traffic jam for sure. Here she is.
