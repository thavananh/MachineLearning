I DIDN'T EVEN SHAVE THIS MORNING. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TODAY, TED? CONFESSIONS AND MASS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I SUPPOSE. YES, DOUGAL, THINGS LIKE THAT. IT'S GREAT BEING A PRIEST ISN'T IT, TED? IT'S LOVELY OUT. OH, WAIT'LL I TELL YOU, FUNDLAND'S COMING TO CRAGGY ISLAND ON SATURDAY! OH, YES, THIS IS THE FAIRGROUND THING. I WOULDN'T HAVE MUCH INTEREST IN THAT TYPE OF THING. THEY'VE GOT A SPIDER BABY. A WHAT? A SPIDER BABY. IT'S GOT THE BODY OF A SPIDER. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A BABY. HOW IS IT A BABY? DOES IT HAVE A NAPPY ON IT OR SOMETHING? NO. WELL, DOES IT HAVE THE HEAD OF A BABY? UMM, NO. WELL, IF IT LOOKS LIKE A SPIDER AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GURGLE AT YOU OR ANYTHING, HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S ACTUALLY A BABY? THEY KEEP IT IN A PRAM. DOUGAL, ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? YOU'RE NOT CONFUSING IT WITH A DREAM YOU HAD? NO, HONESTLY, I SAW IT ON THE NEWS. OH, WAIT... NOW THAT YOU SAY IT, IT WAS A DREAM, YEAH. HAVE YOU BEEN STUDYING THIS, LIKE I TOLD YOU? I HAVE, TED, I HAVE. SORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT WE SHOULD GO ANYWAY. IT'LL BE GREAT. LAST YEAR I HAD A GO AT THE HORSE RIDING. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD RIDE HORSES. WELL IT WASN'T A REAL HORSE, TED. IT WAS THIS OLD FELLA WITH A SADDLE ON HIM. HE MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT 80, YOU KNOW. OF COURSE, HE COULDN'T GO VERY FAST. I WAS KIND OF LASHING HIM WITH THE WHIP, BUT I COULDN'T GET MUCH OF A RESPONSE OUT OF HIM. HOW LONG WERE YOU UP ON HIM? I'D SAY IT WAS ABOUT... AN HOUR. SO, YOU WERE UP ON AN 80 YEAR OLD MAN, RIDING HIM AND WHIPPING HIM FOR 60 MINUTES? YOU REALIZE THAT IMAGE WILL STAY WITH ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE? OH, IT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT? COME ON, WE SHOULD GO. NO, I DON'T THINK I COULD TAKE THE EXCITEMENT. I'LL JUST SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ON THE TELEVISION. (..Man speaking on television ) ARRGH! (..smash ) MAYBE, I'LL JUST GO AND STUDY THE OLD DIAGRAM.

THE BEST WAY TO FIND IT IS TO HEAD OUT FROM GALWAY AND GO NORTH UNTIL YOU SEE THE ENGLISH BOATS WITH THE NUCLEAR SYMBOL ON THE SIDE. THEY GO CLOSE TO THE ISLAND WHEN THEY'RE DUMPING THE OLD..GLOW IN THE DARK. ARE THERE ANY OTHER PRIESTS LIVING THERE WITH YOU? WELL....UHH.... NO, THERE'S NO ONE ELSE HERE.

NONE AT ALL? NO, THE ISLAND ITSELF IS A KIND OF LANDMARK. THE GENERAL RULE IS IF YOU'RE HEADING AWAY FROM IT YOU'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. RIGHT, SO... THERE'S THE FIELD. OH, A FIELD, THAT SOUNDS... IT'S NOT A FIELD, BUT IT HAS LESS ROCKS THAN MOST PLACES NEVER MIND, FATHER, HOW DO I GET THERE? ASK TOM, THERE, HE'LL HELP YOU OUT. RIGHT, FATHER, THANKS. (..SQUAWK ) BIRD! HOLY MARY, MOTHER OF GOD! TED, I'M SO SORRY. IT WAS JUST A JOKE. TRY TO AVOID DOING THAT AGAIN, DOUGAL. I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY... HERSELF. THAT'S THE LAST THING I NEED. YOU'RE RIGHT THERE, TED. ANYWAY, IT'S TIME FOR JACK'S WALK. TIME FOR YOUR WALK, FATHER JACK. ARRRGGGGHHHH! OFF ALONG THE CLIFFS. CAN I BRING HIM TO FUNLAND, TED? HE'D LOVE THAT. NO HE WOULDN'T. TAKE HIM AROUND THE CLIFFS. THIS TIME, IF YOU'RE GOING NEAR THE EDGE PUT ON THE BRAKES. HE WAS ONLY JUST LUCKY THE LAST TIME. YOU'RE NOT COMING? NO, I THINK I'LL STAY HERE AND PRAY FOR A WHILE. O'HO, WHAT ARE YOU AFTER, TED? I'M NOT AFTER ANYTHING, DOUGAL. IT'S NOT UNKNOWN FOR MEMBERS OF THE CLERGY TO PRAY FROM TIME TO TIME. HERE WE ARE, FATHER CRILLY. THERE'S NOTHING FATHER HACKETT LIKES MORE THAN FRESH AIR. GET AWAY! THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT. AHHHHH, AHHHH! THAT'S IT NOW, IN YOU GO. THIS WILL KEEP YOU NICE AND WARM. ARRGH!! BYE, THEN. EVERY SINGLE DAY THE SAME THING. ONCE HE'S OUT THERE HE HAS A GREAT TIME. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO, YOURSELF? OH, I THINK I'LL STAY HERE AND HAVE A BIT OF A PRAY. ALL RIGHT, ENJOY THE REST OF THE WEEKEND. P.A.: Entrants are reminded that parking facilities are unavailable. That's a reminder of the unavailability of parking facilities. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS BLOODY THING WAS ON HERE. TOM, THE TELLY LADS, DID YOU GET THEM HERE? YEAH, THEY WERE GOING TO FILM A BIT OF THE ISLAND FIRST. I'LL JUST WAIT IN THE FIELD. FATHER? YES, TOM? I'VE KILLED A MAN.

I SAY YOU'LL BE MORE THAN A MATCH FOR GAY BYRNE OR ANY OF THEM! I THINK IT WILL TAKE A FEW WEEKS TO GET TO THAT LEVEL. I HAVE TO GO NOW AND TRACK DOWN THIS FILM UNIT. THEY'LL PROBABLY WANT TO DO A FEW CLOSE UPS AND MASTER SHOTS AND THAT SORT OF THING. I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE ON THE SET AND GET A REPUTATION LIKE MARILYN MONROE. GOOD LUCK, FATHER TED! GET THEM FECKIN' CRUNCHIES OUT OF THE CAR! FECK OFF! (..guitar and banjo dueling ) TED! TED! OVER HERE, TED, LOOK AT ME! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, ANYWAY? I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED IN THIS? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING JACK FOR HIS WALK! UUMM, THE CLIFFS WERE CLOSED FOR THE DAY. HOW WOULD CLIFFS BE CLOSED, DOUGAL? OKAY, NO, IT WASN'T THAT.... THEY WERE GONE! GONE, THE CLIFFS WERE GONE? HOW COULD THEY JUST DISAPPEAR? EROSION. COME OFF THAT, STRAIGHT TO THE CLIFFS WITH YOU! THERE'S JUST A COUPLE MORE TURNS TO GO. WHOOOO! (..dueling banjo and guitar ) P.A: Entrants are reminded to keep their hands visible at all times when not availing of the fairground ride. NOW, YOU'RE TO GO STRAIGHT HOME, YOU HEAR? I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE NONSENSE! EVERYONE ELSE IS HERE... YOU'RE A PRIEST, SHOW SOME DECORUM! I wish I wasn't a priest. WHAT? I WISH I WASN'T A PRIEST. IF FATHER JACK HEARD YOU SAY THAT! HE TOLD ME HE DOESN'T EVEN BELIEVE IN GOD! DOUGAL! ♪(..dueling guitar and banjo )♪ TED, CAN I HAVE A GO ON THE CRANE OF DEATH ? IT'S CALLED THAT BECAUSE A YOUNG FELLOW WAS KILLED ON IT LAST YEAR! LOOK, I'M SICK AND TIRED... TED, LOOK THERE'S A FORTUNE TELLER! COME ON, WE'LL HAVE ONE GO IN THERE! DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY ON THAT STUFF, DOUGAL. THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN IT. HOW COULD ANYONE BELIEVE ANY OF THAT NONSENSE! IT'S NO MORE PECULIAR THAN ALL THAT STUFF WE LEARNED. YOU KNOW, HEAVEN, HELL AND EVERLASTING LIFE. YOU'RE NOT MEANT TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. DOUGAL, YOU ARE SO TOO MEANT TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY! ARE YOU? WHAT, HEAVEN, HELL AND EVERLASTING LIFE? YES, OF COURSE! IF I LET YOU GO IN WILL YOU GO HOME AFTER THAT? I WILL, I WILL, I PROMISE. ALL RIGHT. (..beads jangle ) HELLO. LET'S GO TED. WHAT'S WRONG? I'M SCARED. FOR PITY'S SAKE, I'LL DO IT AND YOU CAN WATCH. HELLO, THERE! SIT! FIRST YOU MUST CROSS MY PALM WITH SILVER. I DON'T CARRY HUGE BAGS OF IT AROUND. GIVE ME A POUND! I'LL INTERPRET ONE CARD AT A TIME, PLEASE. BE CAREFUL. (..sighs ) I WASN'T CONCENTRATING, CAN I PICK ANOTHER? NO, NO, THIS IS A COMMON MISUNDERSTANDING. THE GRIM REAPER DOESN'T MEAN DEATH IN THE LITERAL SENSE. RATHER, IT MAY MEAN THE DEATH OF AN OLD WAY OF LIFE AND THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ONE! AHH, I KNOW WHAT THAT IS! IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT A NEW LAMP I'M GETTING. ANOTHER CARD, PLEASE. IS THAT GOOD? WELL.... IT WILL ALL BECOME CLEAR AT THE NEXT CARD. THIS IS REALLY WEIRD! THERE'S ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE ONE IN EACH PACK! HELLO, TOM, IS FATHER CRILLY AROUND YET? HE IS, YES, HE'S IN THERE. THAT'S A NASTY SCAR YOU'VE GOT THERE, TOM. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? I WAS..... IN AN ARGUMENT. OH... I HOPE YOU WON. I CERTAINLY DID! THAT'S NOTHIN'! I'VE HAD WORSE THAN THAT! WOULD YOU BELIEVE ME OWN DOG DID THAT TO ME? DOESN'T IT LOOK LIKE A FACE?! WHERE DID FATHER JACK GET TO? IT'S NEARLY FIVE AND TIME FOR HIS DRINK. YOU GO THAT WAY, I'LL GO THIS WAY. P.A.: Can Siobhan please return to the refreshment tent. COME ON NOW, FATHER WE BETTER BE OFF. COME ON. THERE YOU ARE, FATHER. WE GOT HERE, AT LAST. FATHER, FATHER! DEAD TO THE WORLD. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. GIN! VODKA! THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S TIME FOR YOUR DRINK. YELLOW PACKS! AHHHHH! ARE YOU LADS FROM THE TELEVISION? WELL...YES. REALLY? WE'LL JUST ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. WHAT, AM I GOING TO BE ON THE TELLY? WELL, YES. WE'LL START OFF WITH THE HISTORY OF THE ISLAND. THEN MOVE ON TO HOW LIFE HAS CHANGED FOR THE ISLANDERS ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY. FATHER, HOW WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS HERE ON CRAGGY ISLAND HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE ADVENT OF TELEVISION AND GREATER ACCESS TO.... DRINK! OH, NO, THEY'RE TALKING TO DOUGAL. I'VE GOT TO THINK OF SOMETHING! AHHHHHH! DRINK! DRINK! THERE I AM, IT'S ME, I'M ON THE TELLY! So, God, does He really exist? I mean, who knows, I don't know. Personally I don't even believe in organized religion. I KNOW, IT'S GREAT, ISN'T IT? Spider Baby, it's got the body of a spider but the mind of a baby! OHHHH, OHHHHH.... It couldn't really bite you, uh.... unless it got a bit older. OHHHH, OHHHH... I KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER! I'M ON THE TELEVISION! THAT GODSHITE AGAIN! IS HE NEVER OFF THE AIR!? P.A.: A child has been lodged in..The Tunnel of Goats. If we could have a nurse, please, to The Tunnel of Goats, Thank you. A goat and a child have now become lodged together and the nurse has become involved in the incident and another nurse is required to release the nurse we asked for previously. Thank you.
