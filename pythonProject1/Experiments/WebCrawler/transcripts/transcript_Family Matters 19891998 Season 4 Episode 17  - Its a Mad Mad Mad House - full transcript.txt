Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- Behold, the awesome... the incredible, Annihilator. Oh, just call me Steve. Ha, ha, ha. Ooh, boss ball, big guy. Can I hold it? - Will you be careful with it? - Oh, absolutely. Whoa, Nellie. Why, this baby weighs a ton. - Just give it to me. - You know... I've often imagined myself on the Pro Bowlers Tour. Yeah, traveling from one Midwestern town to another. Hanging out with guys named Merle. Steve, give me my ball. It's the championship match. I've just done my interview with Chris Schenkel... and now it's just me and Earl Anthony, mano a mano. - Steve. - I step to the line... I take aim. I make my approach. One... two, three! - Yes. - Yes, what? Yes, you did that. You always do that. Four, five, six, seven, eight. - Your turn, Judy. - Not so fast. Boardwalk's mine. Pay up. Oh, you're right. And according to this card, I owe you... a buck. I've got a funny feeling I'd have a lot more money if I could read. - Hey, Mom. - Hi. - Hi, Aunt Harriette. Wanna play? - Oh, no, thank you, sweetie. Judy, didn't I ask you to straighten up in here? - Yeah. - Well? You meant today? Laura, did you remember to take the chicken out of the freezer? Oh, I sure did, Mom. About five minutes ago. By the way, Mom, I'm going to a party, and I'm supposed to bring brownies. - Think you could whip some up? - Whip some up? Well, not a lot. Just a few dozen. I have worked overtime every night this week... - and do you know what I am? - Rich? No, I'm tired. I've asked everyone around here to help out. Honey, would you iron this shirt for me? I would do it myself but you always make them so fresh and crispy. Carl, I really don't have time. I can't... Hey, Mom, where's dinner? Edward, I've been home less than five minutes. Can I at least have time to breathe? Sure, but can't you breathe while you're making dinner? That's it. I work 60 hours a week but that's not enough, right? I apparently also have to cook chickens, iron crispy shirts... and bake brownies for the world. - Harriette's right. Now come on, everyone, we've all got to help out around here. - Yeah. We should all pitch in. - Listen. You go upstairs and have yourself a nice, relaxing bubble bath. And when you come back down, I promise you... that there'll be a piping hot meal waiting on the table for you. Thank you. That's an awful lot of work. I appreciate it. Hey, it's no problem. Hello, Pizza City? The logarithm, also called log... is the exponent indicating the power to which a fixed number... "the base," must be raised to produce a given number. Oh, perk up. This is riveting. - Very nice, Vivian. - Thank you, Steven. I realize that logarithms can be difficult. So perhaps... a visual aid might help stimulate your interest. I knew it. - Vivian... - One moment, Steven. Now I want you all to take a close look at the logs on this chart. Now don't just memorize them. Work with them... play with them, see how much fun they can be. What is so funny? Vivian, look at the chart. There's a girl with enormous boom-booms. I am not amused. No one is leaving this classroom until the individual responsible comes forward. Now this lack of respect for math really frosts my behind. Hey, Eddie. Don't forget your poster. Eddie, perhaps you could stay for a moment. - Thanks a lot, Waldo! - No prob, Bob. Eddie, Eddie, Eddie... I'm sorry, Miss Connors. I thought that putting this poster up would be funny... but instead it's turned out to be tasteless and rude. - That's right. - Well, live and learn. Can I go now? - Yes. Down to Principal Shimata's office. - Oh, no! Miss Connors, he just nailed me for writing my number down in the girls' bathroom. He said one more stunt, I'm off the basketball team. Well, you should've thought about that before you tacked up those boom-booms. Yes, ma'am. Eddie, you are a bright young man, why are you behaving this way? I don't know. I guess... I just... Well, I don't know, I mean... Well, I don't wanna lay my problems on you. Problems? What problems? Oh, just stuff, at home. But I don't wanna get into it. It's painful. Eddie, talk to me. What's going on at home? Well, Miss Connors... Oprah uses the phrase "dysfunctional family." But, hey, the bottom line is that I screwed up... and now it's time to pay the piper, so... Eddie, if you need someone to confide in... No. I don't wanna air out dirty laundry. I'll just go down to Principal Shimata's office... and let him take away the one thing I have left that brings me joy. Well, Eddie, Eddie, wait. Maybe in light of your stress at home, we could let this go. - Really? - Yes. But no more hijinks in my classroom. Oh, yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am. Ah. Dopey moi. I forgot my Mr. Calculator. Oh, don't be glum, Vivian. Very few share our passion for trig. No, it's not that, Steven. I'm worried about a student. He says he has problems at home but he won't talk about it. Ah. Another lonely teenage mariner navigating his fragile kayak... through the stormy sea of life. Yeah, something like that. Well, knowing you as I do, Vivian, I'm sure you'll take the active approach. Active approach? Well, this poor teenager, whoever he may be, is obviously crying out for help. - But I don't really know what's wrong. - Well, find out. Investigate. You really think I should? Oh, absolutely. Reach out and touch that student. And tell them Steven Q. Urkel sent you. Mom, can you help me with my science project? Mom, I forgot to tell you, I need a costume for the school play. Honey, have you seen my black socks? The comfy ones with the blue stripe? Hold it. I thought everyone was gonna pitch in around here. I'm helping, Aunt Harriette. Richie! Look at you! - What are you doing? - I'm making a cake for dinner. Mom. What about my science project? Judy, she doesn't have time. My costume's gonna take all night. Where are the black socks? You seen them? Hey, Mom. Where's dinner? All right! All right! All right! That's it! I have asked you again and again to help all around here... and you've ignored me. From now on, you'll see what it's like to have to fend for yourselves! Because Harriette Winslow is on strike! Move out of my way! Well, Dad. Is that legal? Oh, Mom, this place is really getting gross. Then clean it up. I'm still on strike. I can't pitch in right now. I promised Grandma I'd help her get ready. - For what? - Tonight's that charity bachelor auction. Oh, Lord. Remember last year when she bought that date with that retired underwear model? Then demanded her money back when she found out... he modeled ladies' underwear. - Harriette! - Carl! Harriette, I can't find my ripped jeans and my bandanna. I'll call the FBI, dear. I need those things. Tonight is my big undercover drug bust... and I don't have a thing to wear. Carl, where did you see them last? Well, I put them in the hamper two whole days ago. Honey, check the clothes hamper. Well, gee, didn't anybody do laundry around here? Not me. I'm still on strike. Well, excuse me, Norma Rae. - Look, Carl... - No, you look. Now if you wanna play this little strike game with the kiddies... it's okey-dokey with me. But now, you're messing with the big kahuna. And the big kahuna wants some attention from his little wahine. And what would you like your little wahine to do? Well, the hut's a mess. So why don't you just hula yourself on into the laundry room... and wash the big kahuna's wikiwiki. Either the big kahuna's had too many mai tais... or he's got his head up his volcano. Because there is no way this little wahine is going anywhere near your wikiwiki. I'll get it. Hello. Are your parents home? Beats me. Are you here to clean? Um, no. Well, I'd love to chat but I have to go make dinner. - You're making dinner? - Yup. We're having hot fudge sundaes. Thank God. I'm sick of candy bars. - Ooh, Grandma, you look beautiful. - Oh, thanks, honey. I just hope 200 bucks is enough to buy me a decent man. You just be patient and don't buy the first guy that you see. It's a recession, sugar. I might be able to buy two. Carl, you look fine. - No, I don't. Now you know I like to wear my ripped jeans when I go out to buy drugs. Hey, who are you? I'm Vivian Connors. Your son's math teacher. It is no wonder he is acting up in class. - How can he live in this madhouse? - Excuse me? What are you talking about? Eddie said there were problems at home, but this is appalling. Thank God the boy is just pulling harmless pranks. Miss Connors? Oh, Eddie. You poor child. Come here. You need a hug. Steven, I wanna thank you for urging me to get involved. This young man would have been better off raised by wolves. You mean that student with troubles at home is Eddie Winslow? - That's right. - Oh, boy. And I would never have come here if you hadn't urged me to get involved. Come here, Steve. Now, Eddo. You have enough troubles on your hand. No sense adding manslaughter to that list. Will somebody please tell us what's going on? I will. Your son has been acting up in my class... and he confided in me that he is having problems at home. Miss Connors, I assure you that our son, Edward Winslow... is not having problems at home. Yet. Edward, go wait in the kitchen for me. - But, Dad... - Now. Yes, sir. Harriette, would you please explain to Miss Connors here... that we are a very loving family? - I'll try. - Good. And while you're doing that, I'll be in the kitchen killing our son. - Hi, Dad. - Knock it off. Yes, sir. You know, Edward, I just don't get it. You appear to be quite normal. You have all five senses, you walk erect. But yet, you often act like a bonehead! Edward, your mother is out there... trying to explain things to one very traumatized math teacher. Dad, let's just face it. Miss Connors just picked a bad day to visit. And I picked a bad time to say that. Edward, let me get this straight. Now you pulled a stupid stunt in class and got caught. But instead of taking your lumps like a man... you instead tried to make your poor teacher feel sorry for you. You lied about us just to save your scrawny neck. Well, yeah. Man, I was in big trouble and I panicked. Edward, whenever I talk about you... I tell people that my son has a straight A average. He's witty, he's clever... and man, he's even better looking than Denzel Washington. You see, when I lie, I lie up. I am very, very proud of my family. I put them on pedestals... because, son, that's where I think they deserve to be. You're right, Dad. I'm sorry. You know, son, I'm a cop... and every day, I see families out there who really do have problems. That kind of tragedy is nothing to make light of. I know, Dad, and I'm lucky to have a happy home. Well, I am really glad to hear you say that. Because you're gonna be spending a lot of time in your happy home. Ouch. So how's it going out there? Well, I managed to explain why the house is under three feet of trash. And I think she understands why you were going out to score drugs. But she's having real trouble... - with your mother buying men. - Heh, heh. From now on, I expect each and every one of you... to pitch in and help your mom around the house. Is that understood? Yeah. Well, be happy about it. - Yes, sir. Well, thank you, everybody. Okay, the strike is over. Let's clean up this house. Ah, ah. No, no, sweetheart. Since I set the bad example, I'm gonna set the good example. I want you to take the family out to dinner... and when you get back, this house is gonna be squeaky clean. - Let's go to Bubba's Barbeque. - No, I wanna go to Mighty Wienie. No, let's go to Burger Palace. The waiters have nice buns. Mr. Winslow. We're from Squeaky Cleaning. Hey, right on time. It's all yours. Geez, Frank, we're gonna have to call for back up.
