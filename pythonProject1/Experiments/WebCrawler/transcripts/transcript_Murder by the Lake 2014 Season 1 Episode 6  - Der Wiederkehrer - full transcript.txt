Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- MURDER BY THE LAKE - How's the application doing? - What application? For your staff car. - I miss your van. - Tell me about it. - What are they doing there? - They found the body. And Zeiler. From community college. History class, fired-up retirees... - But there's nothing here. - It's Gallows Island. Where they held executions in the Middle Ages. It attracts interest. Smile and wave. Come here for a sec. Take the prints. The results go straight to me. - What is Gschwendner doing here? - It's Zeiler's gun. We can't investigate ourselves. - Oberlander. I'm surprised. - Yes? Why? What happened to your van? Know anything about the victim? Everything points to suicide. Do you have a file on Johannes Leitner? Then Hannah was here in private. The bullet trajectory is consistent with suicide. - Are those painkillers? - Yes. Toxic overdose. He had them on him. He took no chances. Zeiler surprises him: Heknocksher down. - He grabs the gun and goes for it. - Instead of the pills? We'll make it go away. He used to be Zeiler's boss. Her mentor, you could say. You used to be in his unit. Did you have him come? Gschwendner is on our side. Zeiler... You'll be OK. We were lucky. 'Lucky' We.' Because you only have a concussion, and I get to hear a great story. I was staking somebody out. - Just for the heck of it? Yes. Johannes Leitner. - He had ID on him. Why'd you go it alone? - You have him? - You could say that. - The bag too? - What bag? - That was hidden for him there. There was no bag. Who is the guy? What were you doing there? Leitner is the only lead to my father. He disappeared. After all these years. The first solid lead. My father is alive. What makes you think that? Remember that phone call I got? That was Leitner. My father is a good swimmer. Impressive. I got my lifeguard badge too, so what? You've got him. That's all that counts. The guy's dead. He was shot. With your gun. No... That's impossible. There must be a third person. - I've got to go there. - What you've got to do is stay out of it. Besides, you're on sick leave. You stay here a few days. Says the doc, not me. The victim just got out of jail. He came straight here. How much time did he do? - Twenty years. Mrs. Reubach? Hello? I'm sorry. - Oberlander, Komlatschek, Lindau CID - We spoke on the phone. - You talked to my sister-in-law. - Hello? Which of you is the landlady? - I do accounts. Margret, the rooms. I have more work, that's for sure. I live in that part, Margret over there. It's too big for both of us. We mostly rent out to migrant workers. The guy lived there. He came here about three months ago left about three weeks ago. - He checked out? - I wouldn't say so. He owed us the rent. - Where are all his things? - He left nothing behind. Just beat it. You don't know where he's been these past three weeks? - Can you remember any visitors? - No, we don't allow it. - Or we charge double. - But you knew where he came from? - I have a copy of his ID. - I don't mean that. He was in prison. Made parole three months ago. Oh well, guys like him have to live somewhere too, right? True. The house is falling apart. The rent barely covers the cat food So everything rides on me! My sister-in-law doesn't give a damn. Why do you live together? My brother married this woman. So predictable, the idiot. Where is your brother now? He died. He left us both an equal part. Dietmar was a funny guy. I'm sure he's still laughing about it. - No farewell note, Komlatschek. - Farewell note? Johannes Leitner is dead, Mrs. Reubach. The room was spick and span. Not like the rest of the house. What did Margret Reubach say? She wanted to know what the wood on the roof is for. The kid's room is damp. Mildew damage. I have to build another room for Luna. Got to get the wood dry somehow. You believe it was suicide, right? Gschwendner is experienced. He's seen it all. - So he can tell better than us? - He knows Zeiler well. No. I know Zeiler What'll she do if she can't play along? Stand back and watch? As if. Old Devices Repairs of all kind Mr. Drillich. I know you're here. You here to buy something? I'm interested in old typewriters. So you're here about the Mignon. The Mignon A. AEG. - 1924. - No. More like detention center, B Block, 2012. Please, I've done my time. I haven't done anything. - It's about your last cellmate. - Johannes Leitner? - You know where to find him. - Yes, at the coroner's. Dead. - I haven't been in touch since I got out. - Mr. Leitner was out too. Klara, no. Are you insane? - Riding a bike, in your condition? - I can't stand it at Mom's. The old witch. - But she's closer to the hospital - You have company. - A customer. I'm here about the Mignon A, AEG 1924. I'll leave you to it, then. Does your wife know what you used to do? - I'm not proud of it. - Oh yes, you are. Oh, well. A little. Forgery. Four years in prison, Eleven months with Leitner. I was assigned. What do you want from me? Hermann Zeiler. Sound familiar? - Another inmate? Think. Chief Prosecutor in Vienna. Did Leitner ever mention him? No. I had nothing to do with Leitner. Together 24/7 on 12 square meters, as if! He'd read and write all day. And wouldn't be disturbed. - What'd he read and write? - Books, letters. He was super smart. He even had his own groupie. - Name? - You know how it is. A nutcase who falls in love with a killer -A love affair by letter? Yes. Do you have a name? You're the investigator. And she's asking herself what you're afraid of. I don't believe it. Micha. Karsten, What are you doing here? Where's Kim? At work. That's why I'm here, for Luna. What, she got the job? Her old one, at the speech therapist's. Don't tell me you didn't know. You don't talk to each other. Then Ill do the talking, Micha... The OK 2 station is looking for a superintendent. No, that's out of my league. I can put a word in for my son-in-law, me, one of their own. - A retired one of their own. - Thanks a lot! It's a regular job. Evenings and weekends off. Time for the family. Better paid too. Considerably. The moisture comes from the roof. 30,000 to fix it. Estimate's on the kitchen table. And why is this more important than the autopsy? The blood on the knife is Leitner's? - Yes, and the hair too. Zeiler was right. There was someone else. - Where? - On Gallows Island. His killer. They're growing more and more alike. Zeiler would kick our asses if she knew we were in her house. I was just at the coroner's. Leitner's blood is on the weapon. And a hair. How did it get there? Bone fragments with hairs were everywhere. Means nothing. Leitner being hit with Zeiler's gun explains the hair. But the contact shot at the chin? I don't think it was suicide. Zeiler was unconscious so she didn't do it It's homicide. Someone else was there. You don't seem to give a shit. You have a theory, that's all. Let's agree on helping Hannah. Or it'll stick for the rest of her life. I know what I'm talking about. You've known her a long time? - Yes, she's my godchild. - I see. - I was a friend of the family. I was transferred from Vienna to Lake Constance. The Zeilers visited often. Hannah's mother grew up here. What do you know about the accident? - Didn't Hannah tell you? She hardly remembers. And they're not pleasant memories. We went for a picnic. Mom, dad and kid took the boat out. All three went overboard. The parents drowned. I managed to save Hannah. She never got over it. I think there was more. Do you? Because Hannah says? No. She won't let go. She's repressing it all. You're not the first one she casts a spell on with her crazy stories. The father she loved so dearly. He never cared about her. She idealizes him. And she abused her job to find him. Wouldn't we all? - For a date, or a parking ticket, maybe. But dead bodies are a different story, don't you think? You're not taking that, are you? If colleagues look for her and find her private files on Leitner... After what happened today... Find Hannah. Please. You bastard. You lied to me. Why? Stay away from guys like Leitner, you said. You should've listened. - Here we go again... I know when you're lying. I know what you're like when you do. Dietmar was an accident. If you don't get your way. If a man doesn't do as you say.. Believe what you want. Now get out of my way. I helped him. That t was me. God, you scared me. Why? Because... Never mind. So you weren't taken off the case? Yes, I was. Then I can't tell you anything. Officially. Johannes Leitner. Cause of death is clear. - The shot from my gun. - Right. And the autopsy... - His arm was broken. - Yes, the left. He could've shot himself with the right. And despite this, he didn't go to a doctor. - It wasn't treated. Happened maybe three weeks ago. That's right. Three weeks ago he vanished. Speaking of which: maybe I should've tied you to the bed like I told everyone. - Stop walking off, I've had it! - A broken arm hurts like hell. He holds out for three weeks, only to kill himself then? So that explains the pills. For the pain, not the suicide. - That would be enough proof. - Would? Exactly. Your godfather disagrees. Why? No idea. Would you mind? - What's the story on Gschwendner? - Oh, I see... - He says he wants to protect you. - From what? - From yourself. - Meaning...? I don't care whose case this is. But sit down with him and clear the air Talk to him. Promise? I'll take that grunt as a yes. Your things. Your turn. I'm done following you around. Oh, give me a break. Damn this! - Kim. Could you just...? - One moment... What is this? Your dad has to stop butting in. Your family's all over my life! So you'll stay at home then? We need my parents. I want a job. Haven't I waited long enough? OK, count me in. For Luna. But your dad's constant butting in has to stop. Gentlemen? Excuse' me? We'll take it from here. Thank you. Is Luna home? They haven't found anything else. All tracks were trampled over. No bag. -Ms. Zeiler is an excellent officer. Apart from her history. It doesn't affect her work. But we have a body connected to her father. So she says. You want her out of the line of fire? I have to ask you something in private. In the car. Which side are you on? Is there more than one? What if Hannah fired the gun? - A residue test would prove... - Each of us knows how to avoid proof. Let's assume that's what happened. She pushed the guy for info, he wouldn't give, and it escalated. - Even if, you want to cover it up? - It's possible, considering her. So, what side are you on then? You wanted me to keep an eye on her. I'm on your team. What else do you want? She found a life vest. - Excuse me? Her father's, she claims. From back then. - Could she be right? - About what? That her father's still alive. 42, 44, 42, 44... You son of a bitch... You lousy son of a bitch. Gschwendner thought we should take it all with us. That was you? Yes. Do you know what this means? That it's all just my imagination. What about Leitner calling you? Just your imagination? I don't know. We'll find out. Hello. Prison Release Order - Can we secure this? - Sure. Thanks for reporting it. What did she look like? Child psychologist. As beautiful as ever. As if nothing happened. You took me off the case. I'm sorry. But it's complicated. The bullet came from your gun. You were there. - Unconscious, but there. - Leitner must have known my father. Ernst, please handle this like it is - a homicide case. You never stop. Your concern is appreciated but unnecessary. I'm doing this only for you. Leitner had no friends, no family, no contacts. - Stay out of it. What did his list reveal? Nothing. Damn it. Is there any credible proof your father is still alive? No. OK, fine. I'm imagining it all. I believe it myself, by now. But Leitner is still dead and killed, no matter what I saw. Saw what? Him. I thought I saw my father. When, where? That's not the bag from Gallows Island. - What are those letters? - You're off the case, remember? Can we just stick to the rules? Just for fun. Never mind, I'll handle it. They're all washed out. Illegible. - Did Leitner write them? - Yes, to his landlady. They were having an affair, already when he was in jail. - Shall we go? - We? Me and you? Since I'm not wanted here. Where to? Destroying belongings and love letters? Sabine Reubach's a suspect, I'd say... Go ahead. Handle it. Thanks. Komlatschek likes sticking to what's real. And to the rules. - That's OK. - Really? - Still, you know more than we do. - You bet. I've got time. I'm on leave, after all. Suspension is the next step. You know that, right? What do you want? You believe in love, right, Mrs. Reubach? And he left you shattered. You waited for Leitner for years: Then he gets out and he's lost all interest. Even if, so? So you were furious. Did you stalk him? See him with another woman? On Gallows Island, with me. - Me you knock down, him you kill. - No. No, that's not true. That's just great. We each have a cellar. Oh come on. You both-live here. Of course you knew. Only that Sabine had fallen for that bastard, of all people. -Did they have a fight? Because of the other woman? Other woman? Sabine completely lost it. And Leitner wanted out. - And that's what he did. - Yes. To the cellar. I have nothing to do with it. Think again what you'll say. If we find you were down there, you're done for - Unlawful detention. - Five years. Do you understand? - He wouldn't press charges. - Excuse me? I heard him yelling. I found him, and set him free. He just wanted to go, that's all. - Who broke his arm? - Who do you think? Sorry, it took a little longer. That was an accident. An accidental kidnapping That's a good one. No, the broken arm. I just wanted to help Johannes - You help and he breaks his arm? - It was the metal door. I see. You incarcerated Johannes Leitner. Just to bring him to his senses. We wanted to be happy. And? Was he happy? With a piss-pot and shackles? - That wasn't my fault. - Right, I'm sorry. It was because of the other woman. Name? I don't know. We wrote each other every day, for years. You don't destroy that! - I loved Johannes. - Like your husband before that? - I didn't harm Didi - You ran him over! No, I ran into him. An accident, in the garage, after groceries. - No matter what Margret told you. - And Leitner? You followed him. You? Come in by the back door again? This is Sabine's. She photographed Leitner with her rival. Take a look. You're not working on this case. Please take a look. - You got angry and hit her. - No! Then you shot Leitner. That's not true. I've never been to Gallows lsland. Jealousy. She mistook you for someone else. Maybe a case without a double bottom for once... This is Leitner's movement profile, from his cellphone. Very good, thanks. Gleggen Quarry You're clearing out your desk? Don't you think Gschwendner will pardon you again? I thought it was a lead. I was wrong. It was her. A simple homicide. No mystery. Zeiler... I've been grasping at straws far too long. An all-points bulletin for your father. I was 12. I was hoping. I saw him. On Gallows Island. He was there. Stop it. Stop it right now. He's alive. He's alive? Hermann. My old friend. Glad to see you. Have a seat. How are you? How do you feel when you've betrayed everything? Family, friends, yourself? A life in the darkness? The darkness has certain advantages. You're going to pay. Every cent you owe me. With interest. I've been dead for a long time. You get used to it. After a while you get used to doing without certain things. But you're different. You wouldn't do without anything. That's why you're vulnerable. So think twice about what you'll do. - You knocked Hannah down. - What could I do? Shoot her? Was it worth it? Abandoning your daughter? Someday she'll find you. God knows, she'll find you. Then I'll have to take responsibility for my actions. But not yet. You're going to pay. They were here. Both of them Leitner and your father. They arranged to meet here. But why? Your father fired, right? - He killed him. Why would my father do that? Oh, Zeiler. Why would your father do any of these things? He disappears and turns up again 25 years later. And you just happened to be there. No one saw it coming. Leitner found my father and could've blown his cover any minute. The bag. He blackmailed your father, and paid for it with his life. - This is how Gschwendner wants it, right? - It's the law, Mrs. Reubach. Johannes told me he was afraid of him. - Of whom? - Gschwendner, of course. - He knew my colleague? - The necklace too? - No, you can keep it. It's because of the damn money. That's why Johannes was killed. Leitner had money? How much? 50,000, Sabine Reubach says. She hid it. 50,000. She takes it, he finds out she kills her lover. Another motive. Why would she implicate herself by telling us? Besides, she locked him in the cellar. The evidence in the cellar doesn't prove that. Maybe it was a party of fetishists. Why didn't Leitner report her for unlawful detention? We don't have enough on her. - Says who? - The judge. - So, the warrant's not coming through? There's no confession from Sabine Reubach We're still in the dark. And the money? Oberlander. - Yes. Your application for my staff car. All filled in. - Your staff car? - You're driving it all the time. - So you finally get a new one? - But you love old cars. - Sounds like a bad deal. Better than losing my car because of you. Are those the shots from Reubach's cellphone? Not much to go on. Jealous fantasies don't need much of a trigger. All in the head. At least we have a license plate. I'll check it. - And? - It's a staff car. Registered to the Justice Department, Bregenz Appellate Court. How about that! Mrs. Herbrechter? Oberlander, Lindau CID. This is my colleague. - What do you want? - Do you know this man? That would be pushing it. - How do you know him? I've been divorced a while now. I thought Leitner was a gentleman. A nice, courteous man. What else can I say? It looks like you're fighting. - That was when I'd found out - Found out? - He'd been lying. - About what? About everything. A real bon vivant. It was all just hot air. Like the Beetle he drove. Collector's item for romance's sake. What a laugh. Did he tell you about his dealings or plans? Did the name Hermann Zeiler come up? No. After a few dates, it was over. Better that way. Why, is he in trouble? Is he in jail again? No, he's dead. The Beetle, was it green? You lent Johannes Leitner your car. - No, that's a misunderstanding. Enlighten us. -It was his car. He gave it to me. That's very generous. Why? Why? He owed me a favor. He wanted to get rid of everything, start over. With that hot little blonde. That's the truth. With her? I said hot. And blonde. There was no money in the hideout. Not one cent. Why would she make it all up? To make us think there was more to Leitner's murder. She's lying. - Hey, Ernst. - Yes? Does it he name Juliane Herbrechter ring a bell? No. Cut the suspense. Who is she? She's the reason Sabine locked up Leitner. She saw him with Herbrechter. See? Another woman. Jealousy. Maybe Herbrechter was lying, and it was purely business. If I'm boring' you, just say so. There's no way around it. I have to remember. Have a nice evening. Hi, Karsten. Know where Kim is? She's at work, right? I have to get used to it. - Kim is picking up your daughter, Micha. - Oh, shit. Of course. I'm sorry. Weren't you in charge of Germany and Austria for Interpol in your day? - Yes. You want a job there? - No. - Do you know an Ernst Gschwendner? - Of course. Everyone knew him. He was pretty unconventional. But very successful. Made everyone happy, on both sides. A guy like that, suddenly turning up here? How's that for a coincidence... Have you given the superintendent position any thought? Not really. This won't be the last repair The house, the family. It'll cost you. And more and more, the older Luna gets. We have everything we need. Thank you. Oberlander? I have to talk to you. My mother was saved. But she drowned anyway. Just great. It burned down yesterday. Today, the owner came up. - Johannes Leitner. - Correct. Do we have anything? Let's see. It's like after a plane crash. - Damn it. - Shit. - Oh, God. - Just wait outside, honey. No, Gabor. Please, no... - Oh God, let's call the police. - No. I don't think anything's missing. Let's calm down first, OK? Seething with Anger Threats and Abuse of Office Yes, we'll be right there. Didn't we agree that this was my office? Just joking. Come on, the colleagues found something. Dear colleagues. We can't wait. - Hermann Zeiler is alive. - You fell for that nonsense, too? I saw him. Leitner's fingerprints are all over this. - Over what? - Papers, documents. -Over what? Papers, documents. - So you don't know. - Not yet. But all these clues led Leitner to my father. The fire was no coincidence. Oliver Wallner? There's nothing on him. No data, no pictures, nothing. So, another phantom? I found two names. Oliver Wallner and Brigitte Haas. Died in 1992. - Who's that? - From Vienna? - You too? - Never mind. Dear friends, I'm in charge of this case. Hannah, you're off it. Like before. I accepted your meddling so far, but this is it. Please leave the precinct, or I have to take this upstairs. - Ernst, I think... Hannah, enough I'm protecting you from yourself. And you're out now, too. My people are taking over. - A suicide or a murder case? - Whatever case it is. Yes, we're on. - So, Zeiler, we're off the case. - As off as off can be... Brigitte Haas was my first case. My first body ever. She died in a home. Heart failure, supposedly. To me, it looked like someone just might've taken a pillow and.. But no one was interested. There wasn't even an autopsy. What's wrong? - The necklace. What about it? I've seen it before. With a piss-pot and shackles? - That wasn't my fault. - It was the other woman. - Right, I'm sorry. The other woman. Name? How about that... We wrote each other for years. You don't just destroy that... Tell him I'll bust his ass... Hi guys. Good you're here. This is our main suspect, Sabine Reubach. She's in detention. What we need is a confession. Have fun. Hold him off once he heads for her. Take a good look. Where did you get it? Mrs. Reubach? From Johannes. A gift His loot. And the money? Was that loot too? Shit. - Shopping bags, she said. - Yes, but there's nothing here. Komlatschek, were you at Sabine's cottage? .Thanks. And? - It was Gschwendner. - Of course. It's Komlatschek. - It's getting really dirty. What is? I just found out the Brigitte Haas case was Geschwendner's. And who shelved the case? Chief Prosecutor Hermann Zeiler. - And who inherited? - One Oliver Wallner. And the clerk in charge of estates was Juliane Herbrechter. Gschwendner knows her. - Is that a guess? - I saw them together. She worked on the case? Mrs. Haas lived in Vienna, but inherited a fortune on the lake. A fortune mentioned in the will... I already counted another four estate fraud cases. The deal was worth millions. So do we have enough on Gschwendner now? No, they were very clever. But he didn't think Wallner would turn up again. He'll make a mistake. We won't wait for it to happen. I be in touch What do you mean? Where are you going? - Do we know who she is? - We're on it. - I thought we'd meet in town. - My bike broke down. Hop in. You've done a lot for me, all those years. I was and am at your side, Hannah. Why, actually? Guilty conscience? What the...? - Pull over up there. My mother had to die. Because she had found out. She was about to stop you. What are you talking about? My father is Oliver Wallner, right? You were all in it together. Juliane Herbrechter knew who owned valuable real estate here. Nothing easier for you than finding out who had no heirs. Seniors. Single. Rich. The victims were all from Vienna. Why? Because you knew the city. The inspector and the prosecutor. And because there was no link to the real estate here by the lake. No one asking questions post mortem, or remembering... Clever. Very clever. Nonsense. Johannes Leitner killed these people on your orders. You covered his back. But when my father disappeared, it was over. Leitner went to jail for his last murder. I have nothing to do with it. It couldn't have happened without you. You verified natural causes. My father, alias Oliver Wallner, inherited. So spare me your lies. - Did you know he was still alive? - No. You better get some rest. I'll take care of everything, OK? You might be right. You miserable piece of shit. We had a deal, Gabor, remember? Part of it was that I don't exist. Mr. Zeiler, please... - That's treason. I'm so sorry. It was an accident, I didn't want this. Where are the documents? Everything connecting Wallner to me. My ID's, pictures, passports, diplomas. I destroyed everything. I swear. My father is cleaning up mercilessly. Leitner and Herbrechter are dead. Drillich is afraid for his life. My father is working off a list. You're on it too, no doubt about it. Then you're on it too. Did you kill my mother? It was you. It was you, on the motor boat. You rescued her out of the water, in front of my eyes. Only to drown her behind my back. You'll pay. I thought you wanted a normal life, with a wife and child? - Once again: where is the stuff? - L have to look. Better hurry, or you'll bleed to death. Maybe in there. That's not my stuff, Gabor. It's a big house. Let me look. Please. Why are you so greedy, Gabor? Once wasn't enough for you and Leitner. 50,000, that would've been OK. But now, a quarter of a million? What would happen the second time around? That I'd keep paying up until the end of my days? - She's not in there. - She won't answer. I don't believe this. We need to think clearly. All right. So what happened 20 years ago? Leitner thinks Zeiler is dead. No more business model. The jackpot loot, also kaput. Gone. Lost. But then Leitner meets Gabor Drillich in jail. Who happens to know Zeiler is alive Because he forged his papers. Drillich thinks he's struck gold. He takes on Zeiler. But he's out of his league. Leitner is released, looks for Zeiler and finds him. His death sentence. - Zeiler? - Headquarters. - Fuck! - Yes? We're on our way. Emergency call from Drillich's house. Pull over. - He'll turn up sooner or later. - What do I do then? They're over there in the workshop. Careful, he's got a gun. Hannah? What? You want to shoot me? Running into you wasn't the plan I see. Then what was the plan? To pretend I'm dead. This man is bleeding to death. And you just don't give a damn? You're going to let me go now. You couldn't let it go, could you? You have a good life. That much I know. Because you were in my house once? Not because you cared about my life. You abandoned me. Since that day, nothing has been right Do you know what it's like, living in that kind of doubt? You just accepted all the consequences. Yes I did. We agree on that. And now you will let me go. Thank God. What happened? Drillich is badly hurt. My father took his girlfriend hostage. Thomas. She's crazy, uncuff me. Aren't we all? Somehow? It'll be a girl. - Gabor Drillich will be a father. - Nice. Come on. He's going to testify. It doesn't look good for you. Ernst Gschwendner, you're under arrest. I won't bother reading you your rights. I'm terribly sorry, Zeiler. You saved my life. About everything, I mean. What you went through all these years. You always said the doubt was the worst. That's over now, right? The ghosts I conjured up.. They're already making bets at the precinct. On how we'll handle the case. Thanks You said 'we.'
