OK, so you know that it's not going to work, right? Then what was that stunt about? Of giving two bottles of blood? Was that needed at all? Does that help you? What do you mean? I mean to say that you went unconscious in front of her. Instead of impressing her... you got embarrased in front of her. You can't do it. Do one thing, just go to her and. Tell her that you like her. I like you very much and that's all. You get it. Hello. Oh hello. You came again here. I don't know. How to thank you. No, it's not needed at all.

And after getting rejected, he got some poison. Just shut it down. Pyare, Just don't do anything silly like this. Mr pyara, Don't mind these talks. There is nothing left in women. They all are coming and going. Oh yousuf is right. I think human must feel lost when. All of his attempts goes in vein. You fell in the trap of a woman. By the way, Pyare, when we asked you about the same... then you lied to us. I understood it after getting hurt. That to hide the diasease from a doctor.

You see, you've to stand like this and smile. Why are you making fun of me? No, you don't have to do anything. I think you're forgetting your adulthood. - Yes I am. If I stand like this, then my knee will hurt. Doesn't matter if you hurt your knee. You've to do it. I am late today. Here she comes, just stand. Just smile. Oh no, he is here only. Now, just have a look at this lover. Okay. Just keep smiling. Just keep smiling. So he is the one. He looks good though. He looks good. Can't you see his misbehavior? You are dumb, Pammi.

Sukhi, I think it's working with pyare. My heart says that you've gone mad. No idiot. I know what women thinks. Nicely. I have met her today. Our sweet friend pyara. He it. You are so dumb. Gupta, I think she'll get him arrested. Just do one thing, call sekhu. Talking priorly will be good for us. Call him before she gets him arrested. Yes, you're right. Let me call sekhu. Hello ma'am. Hello. Let's sit somewhere. May I know? That whatever you're doing. What does it means? I've had a small chat with you in the park for once or twice. I don't know what you thought of. Do you find it right? Whatever you're doing. I don't know it but. But I don't find it wrong at all. I have just. Seen you accidently, and I liked it. And then I saw you again and again. And every time I liked it. Very much. And when I couldn't hold it. Then I'd to tell you. After that, this or that... However, they were asking me to I was doing. Actually I don't know how to... Talk to a woman. Actually, I never had any women in my life. My wife, was good. We have been together for 10 years. And after that she died. After that. I was at home and uh in the office. In the market and schools of my children. And life was on another path. Now it feels like I'm having any lonely slot in my heart. Btw kamal, He was not after you this time. You have asked him to meet. Yes, but I wanted to scold him. I called him to fight with him. Then why haven't you fought with him? Actually, he felt an empty space in his life, so he proposed you. You feel it too, but you don't have the guts to say it. Kamal, Doesn't matter how much you talk... about the rules of the society. A women to a men, and a men to a women... Needs each other in this age. Empty space. Come on pammi, I have my children. And they have theirs. Just see kamal. Just like you were busy with your children. That's how your children are busy with their children. That's the only truth. I don't know. I'm not getting it. You speak like this whenever you're confused. Just see kamal. Whenever you feel the need for any kind of relation in your life. Then please don't lie to yourself. Pyare, If you don't share anything then. How will we suggest? She said something? something? She was very angry. What? After that, what have you done? Have done nothing. It would make it more complicated. I told her everything. Does that changed her mind? No. Then there's no point in suggesting you. - suggesting who? What is this? First, you all suggested me. I agreed it and now you're laughing. Sorry. You all deserve this. Hmm. Ma'am... Uh. "Whatever you'll be demanding, I'll be getting it to you" "You accepted my proposal at sharp quarter to five and at five... I've already finished a quarter of alcohol" "You accepted my proposal at sharp quarter to five and at five... I've already finished a quarter of alcohol" Exactly. We forgot ourself. And our whole life, we were living for others. We haven't noticed that at all. And life goes just like this. Actually. If you see, then our life is like this sun. How is that? The sun shines for everyone in this world. From morning to evening. I travels all around the world. Then when it is done. Then it must be thinking that. It's alone at the end of the day.

You're having your chain right. I'm doing good but. We've to complaint against them to police. Give us your ID proof. And we will take your report. Hero you go. Incidents like this are happening here rapidly. You gave your complaint to us. Now let us handle it all. Okay. What happened? You still look tensed. We have got our cell phone stolen. No, it's nothing like that. Actually I was thinking that. After reaching home, I'll tell everything about us to my children. I was thinking that too. They're still our child. But they're grown up. They understands everything. Yes, you are right. This jacket is beautiful. My shawl is also good. Is it? Let me tell you something. Yes, please. I like your company. I have heard this already. I was afraid at that time. But now I'm confident enough to say this. You're good too. I want to thank you. Why? Thanks. To remind me that. There are many ways to live your life. But I think that. During all these years. I was hiding myself from me. My lonliness was not seen by me. But my lonely soul was just like that. After having you in my life, I realised all this. That in fact. In this age? The financial securities. Physical needs. Nothing is needed at all. All we need during this age is. Someone's support and someone's company. To cover the rest of our life. With a partner. The presence of a partner for the rest of the life. I felt lonely actually. But the happiness of having someones company. I understood it when you came to my life. Come. Ok goodnight. Vikram. Vikram. Brother. Greetings uncle. You used to call. I am here to meet my sister. I thought to forgive my sister. And to get rid of this burden on my heart. You'll see that my sister will forgive me. Exactly, uncle. It's been said that, the blood relations never fades away. You're right. I've been bearing this pain of losing... someone since a very long time. But not anymore. Go and call my sister. Tell her, that her younger brother Billa is here. Mom's phone is not ringing. Redial it. Hello, dear brother in law. If you were alive. Then we would have been partying. Uncle, moms phone is not reachable. Let's have some tea. You know, my children were tensed since a long time. That I'll be left alone when they'll leave to Canada. Now, they will be tension free. I'm not even worried about my children. What to wear and which doctor to visit? They just have to inform me. Yes. Is this the home of Kamaljeet kaur? Yes. Greetings. Greetings. How are you related to kamaljeet kaur? She is our mom. Do you recognise it? It's our moms chain. Oh my goodness. What happened to my mom? Nothing has happened to her. Your mother is doing good. And your father is also doing good. Father. Father. Sir, it seems like you misunderstood it at all. No I have not. Your mother and father left for Kasauli from Kalka. They encountered 2 guys in between. And your mother's chain and your fathers wallet? They stole it and left for Chandigarh. And we caught them on the barricade. These are the papers of lost and found. You need to sign them. Here's the wallet of your dad. Greeting to all. Have some. Greetings. What greetings. We don't need your greetings. Just wait a minute. Whoever you're Sir, just lower your tone. I'll be lowering your tone in just in a minute. If you want me to behave like myself. Does this cell phone and this wallet belongs to your dad. How you got this? It doesn't matter how we get it. Just tell us where is your father? He isn't at home. He'll be coming soon. Just look after your father. Or else I'll beat him. Hello, just behave yourself. We're not here to talk. Do you know it? Your father and my sister. That is their mother. He is in Kasauli with her. We are here. To tell you that, look after your father. To stay away from our mother. Or else. We are here just for once. Just understand it and make your father understand. Let's go, uncle. I'll call you when I'll be at the booth. Okay. Okay. So my kajal daughter is here. Dad, your wallet and your phone. That have arrived before you. Straight from Kasauli. You are late, dad. You went to Kasauli. Right? Tell us. Why are you so quiet? Whatever you are thinking of. We haven't said anything. We haven't said anything but just asking... that have you visited kasauli or not. It's just a simple question that have you visited kasauli? Why are you not answering us? Answer us dad! Yes, I went there. You spent a night there. With a women. Rajnish son! Just be in the limits of your behaviour. insolence? We don't know how to behave, right? Just know that you spent a night with... a women without letting us know. Kajal, I've every answer to their questions. It's good that we should take a seat and talk. Yes, obviously you're the only sensible person here. So that we've to sit with you and talk. Nisha, you are crossing the limits. Okay, so tell me. You've crossed the limits, right? And you're telling me that I'm crossing the limits? Intelligent people always gives knowledge to their youngers. And look at them. Father, the age in which people marries their childrens. You're doing the same thing at this age. And she must be the same too. - Nisha. I won't tolerate it. If anyone talks inappropriately about her. Just go to your room. Dad. Hi, boys. All good. Ballu brother, you? After all these years, you remember me now. Mom, this is your chain right? Where have you found this? Where have you been yesterday? And with whom you went there? What do you mean? That's not the answer to our question, Mom. A police officer gave us this chain. And along with some Pyarelal sharma's phone and wallet. And he was saying that you along with our father is in Kasauli. Who is Pyarelal, mom? Don't shout, Vikram. I will, mom. Till the time you aren't telling us that what... is the relation between you and Pyarelal? He is just a good friend of me. No women and men can be friends in this age. Let's suppose they can be friends. But friends don't spend nights with each other. The too, without children. You're doubting me just because of some... police officers misunderstanding. On your mother. You are the reason for it, mom. What? Yes. Mom, if you're not wrong. Then why have you kept it hidden from us. Why haven't you told us? No, I haven't kept it hidden. Sister. I came here because. I was missing you so much. I thought that. I will ask you for your forgiveness. And you will forgive me. But after coming here. I'm seeing another culprit. You should be ashamed of yourself. 35 years ago you'd made all of us ashamed. And today. You've made all of us ashamed today. Ain't you ashamed of yourself after... talking to your sister like this. I was waiting all these years. That whenever my brother will come back. Then I will hug him so much. I will kiss his forehead. But he came. Just to spoil everything. The nest that I had build... With all the things, much lovable than my own life. I have kept my children at ease. And those childrens now. Just don't worry, Kamal. Everything will be at peace with time. I was waiting for my brother all these years for this day? Everyone. Without even asking. Has labelled me as a culprit. Do you know, pammi? Till the time when I forgot about myself. And I was living for my family. Everything was fine till that. Why have I done this? Why have I thought to have a different life than this. To stay happy. To have some dreams. No. This doesn't happened well. No one has listened to me. They all made me a culprit. I'm sitting here since morning that too, alone. I went upstairs. And then I came back here. Just to say sorry about anything that I've done wrong. Anyone will come to give me some water? Then I'll ask them to sit and listen to me. No one has came. I think that they don't want to see my face. I broke my whole family. Pyare, if there's a God up there. I broke my family. Then he's listening. And my heart says that. Nothing wrong will happen with you. Everything will be fine soon, pyare. Just don't lose hope. Let me talk to Sukhi and Gupta. Hi. Hi, Mom, how are you? I am. What happened, Mom, you don't look good. I am doing good. Vikram has called me. He was saying anything about you? Just don't cry please. Mom. After Dad, you've looked after all of us alone. And now we all are settled in our life. Have all of the sacrifices have been made, already. Now live your life. I will adjust. Just don't worry. Will you be adjusting your whole life? Mom, everyone needs a company in their life. Life doesn't gives a second chance to all of us. If someone has arrived to fill the empty space in your life. Then don't let him go. I love you Pooja. Love you too, mom. Take care. Bye. Ok daughter! Bye. Brother, it's such a bad thing. We will be disrespected all around if our neighbors find this out. What will we do of them? It can be a misunderstanding too. There's a reason behind everything. Those guys who came here to return the wallet and money. Weren't getting angry without any reason. And no one likes to add a random strangers... name with their mother or sister. I'm not getting it. Mom have denied to have anything. Nothing will happen. She won't die if she don't eat. What? The way we behaved with mother, was it right? Issues like this aren't sorted with patience. Just go, we will see it. By the way. It's not that big of an issue. What are you talking about brother? It's not a small issue. What is father doing in this age? That's what I'm saying. He's a sensible person. By the way, what's right in this? Though father have always sacrificed his happiness for ours. He's a sorted person from the beginning. You mean to say that the world can say anything. I have seen many older guys. See. Issues like this are always sorted by talking patiently. We even haven't had any talk with father. Brother. We will be talking to father, but he'll say that. What is he says something else? My younger sister is about to get married. Will I be telling my new relatives that... we are going to find a new mom? Nisha please. First you scolded Dad and now you both are fighting. Why are we here? We should be leaving. No brother, please sit here. Father haven't had anything since yesterday night. Let me serve him some breakfast. And we'll talk to him. Politely. Here it is. Dad. Dad. Dad. Nisha. Dad isn't home and his phone isn't reachable. Brother, just call Gupta uncle. He haven't left without telling us. He must be on the walk. Hello. Yes, I am rajnish. Yes, tell me. Is father with you, uncle? No, I came at the shop in the morning. What happened? Nothings wrong uncle. Hello, yes sukhi. Just pray that my sister isn't at their home. Or else the things I haven't done till late. I will not hesitate doing this. Uncle, the stay calm. We don't want to do anything like this. Brother, they are here again. What happened now? Just beware if you can save yourself for me. Don't let me kill you before your father. Just take care if this gun. Don't act smart here. This is not the occasion to fight. But if you want to, then let's fight. Where is our mom? How we are supposed to know? We couldn't even find our father. And it'll be better that you guys look for... your mother and we look for our father. What's say brother? Yes. Let's go. I have met pyare. He is very sad. Yes. Let me talk to rajnish. Okay. Hello. Uncle is dad with you? Rajnish, I know what's happening in your family. But I know pyare, before your birth. So it's my duty to talk to you. When the children are giving knowledge to their parents. That means they are grown up. If you are grown ups. Then you should think before you speak. Son, Pyare needs your presense. After punit's death has she ever let you feel this? That you don't have a father. You've made her alone today. Instead of understanding her, you're misbehaving with her. Just think about it guys. When the childrens are grown up. Then they start finding flaws in their parents. That's the only difference between parents and children. That parents think before this week. And childrens, they speak without even thinking. Pyare. Whatever we've done. Was that wrong? If that was wrong. Then why would we be doing that? But people found it wrong. We all were living, not our life... But an identity. Daughter, son, father, mother. Husband. Wife. All of this. Are the names of that identity. Some ancient rules. Are forced on us to obey. The society will never change, Pyare. The thing that we call society. Does changes. But just for itself. And it never changes for women. Yes, but for us. The society is our children only. So we've to complete all of our duties. To adjust. Is in the fate of parents only? Yes. Let's what we've been doing till now. And we have to do this forever. It means. Our togetherness was till this time only? I think we were supposed to be together till this time. That to spend some quality time. And then have the separate ways. If we leave each other then. Will everything be just like it was? Is it that easy? To leave each other. There is nothing hard to feel alone for the second time in life. What will be harder than this? We have to believe in it. We will think that. This is it. That for a moment or too. We were met. We sat and had some chat. And now, the fatigue... of my life, is gone away. And then. We will be bearing all of our life's weight. And let's complete the rest of our life. I'll be here for walk in the morning by tomorrow. And you'll be here too, in the evening. No. I will come in the morning. You be here in the evening. No. Now no new experience. Now, I don't have the strength to get a new experience in my life. Listen. We... Should take a selfie for memory. Do I look bad in this selfie? Billu brother. You all, here? You know how dumb your children are... you must have discussed it with me. After getting it discussed by you. Let me complete my desire to have my sister married. What say sister? Billa brother, Whatever you're thinking isn't right. We're just good friends. Mom, where have it written that two friends cannot stay together? Just listen to him. It means that if we ask you for your mother's hand to our father... then you won't deny right? Not at all. Hi old man, what's the report? See, I told you right that it'll work. It worked. I feel good. Yeah.
