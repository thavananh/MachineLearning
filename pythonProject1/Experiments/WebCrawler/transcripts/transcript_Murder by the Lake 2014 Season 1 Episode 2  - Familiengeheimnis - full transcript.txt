Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- There was a dog. - He's not home. - He must be. He has a visitor. Look. There's been a fight Get lost! Mr. Garchinger? It's me, the Count. - Let's discuss things sensibly. - Guido... Where's that damn receipt stamp? I can't find it. The daughter of reflection. - What? 'Order is the daughter of reflection.' Lichtenberg. Never heard of him. In my old office I always managed to find everything. - I have mine between outgoing and done. - Wonderful. 'German-Austrian Crime Division. Whoever came up with that name... Suspicion of domestic violence at a forester's, German side. It seems to be serious. Maybe I should come along. - No, thanks. - That won't be necessary. What's the forester's name? Garchinger. Are you serious? I know his children, Oliver and Verena. We went to school together. I used to see Verena a lot. I mean the two of them, at their home. - I hope it's nothing serious. - One never does when it's personal. Mr. Garchinger, are you there? Open the door. Hello, detectives. We have-to go. I have a conference call. Shit. Take cover, please. Mr. Garchinger? Mr. Garchinger, it's Micha, Micha Oberlander. Should we call SWAT? - No, we're going in. - Ask for backup. Mr. Garchinger? Oliver? Mr. Garchinger? Oh, shit. Zeiler. There. Mr. Garchinger? Mr. Garchinger? Can you hear me? Mr. Garchinger? Is there anything you can say? He was severely dehydrated. Maybe poisoning or an epileptic shock. How far can a person go with an arm cut off? Not far if the bleeding isn't stopped. He'll go into cardiac arrest. What if the bleeding was stopped? - He'd need a lot of painkillers. - And watch out for an infection. - But he could survive? - Absolutely. We have to go. - Of course, thanks. Have a nice day. - Yes? - Komlatschek speaking. We've checked all hospitals and emergency clinics. No man without an arm in a 50-km radius. Good, then he's probably still here in the forest. Could you order some extra blood? How's the family doing? His wife and daughter are on a cruise in the Mediterranean. - They're being told to come back. - Good. and Oliver? Who? The son. - I don't know about a son. - He's an old friend of mine. - OK, I'll take care of it. - All right. And then come here. We need someone to coordinate the search. - So now you want me there? - Exactly. If only it doesn't rain, or all traces will wash away. - See you later, Komlatschek. Thanks. - You're welcome. Kraut. - Who was that jerk? - Guido von Hochheim. He owns the forest on the other side. - I thought you abolished nobility. - We did. - What was the Count here for? - A neighborly visit. - What's so funny? - He likes you, the Count. Looks like your friends' father went on a killing spree. Find out how many weapons Garchinger owned and if any are missing. - How much? - 100,000 euros. May I? Have it analyzed. As soon as possible. Did you see the delivery van? From a recycling firm. - Yes. - It's reported stolen. Ok. I'm coming. Should I go to the hospital while you check that firm? It's an Austrian firm. Your people. I'm going to the German hospital. I thought because of your personal involvement. What do you mean? - The love of your youth. - I never said anything about love. - You didn't have to. - Nonsense. And, will he make it? - You mean he's already... No, but he has no chance. - What does he have? - Rabies. Rabies? But there must be an antidote. Only during the incubation period. Once the virus is in here, it's too late. How long does he have? - A few hours, a few days. Why are the lights off? In his condition the slightest stimuli torment him. Where can I get One of those masks? He's suspected of seriously injuring a man who's disappeared. I don't believe he'll be able to help you. But if you decide to go in, please do so slowly and very quietly. Is it possible to find out how he got infected? He had bite wounds and scars on his body, probably from a dog. He had a dog, but it ran away. Then make sure they find him. It's a time bomb. I said I want it pressed by this afternoon. Has it been pressed? - This is company grounds. - Yes, I know. - Hannes Fitzner? - Yes. Are you sure? Yes, he got that watch from Grandpa. And that burn is from a mishap with the barbecue. Identity confirmed. We're looking for Ferdi Fitzner. Continue searching. - Who does such a thing? We're still investigating it. The highest priority is finding your father. Any idea where he could be? Does he often use the company's delivery van? No, never. Otherwise I wouldn't have reported it stolen. I don't see what he needed it for. - He has his convertible. - Is the name 'Garchinger' familiar to you? Yes, of course. Sepp the forester. He and my father were good friends. Why? Does he have something to do with this? The delivery van was outside Garchinger's house. Mr. Garchinger, do you hear me? It's Micha, Micha Oberlander. I used to be friends with Verena and Oliver, remember? Verena and your wife are on their way. We haven't reached Oliver yet. Mr. Garchinger? Mr. Garchinger? Listen, we'll do it another way. I ask a question, you nod or shake your head. OK? You were at home by yourself these last few days, right? But you had a visitor? Mr. Fitzner from Bregenz, correct? Did you argue? Fight? Mr. Garchinger? Damn it. Sorry, it's important. Oliver is dead? - Yes, lung cancer. - Oliver is dead? - Yes, lung cancer. If you knew him, I'm sorry. - When? Six weeks ago. Anything else? Yes, it's been pouring. All traces have been washed away. The dogs aren't barking anymore. I need a clothing sample. From the rags on the arm. For the dogs. One more thing: Our local authorities have conferred with virus experts. Garchinger's land and the surrounding woods will be declared a rabies area. What does that mean? - Warning signs will be placed. - Oh, terrific. And authorization has been given to shoot Garchinger's dog. But we should be discreet about the rabies issue. At least until the dog's been found. - We don't want to scare off the tourists. - Yes, that's how they look at things. Thanks. Why are you calling now? We've been waiting for days Hello? Sorry, do you speak English? Rabies Warning Danger Area Still no dog and no Fitzner. It's like two needles in a haystack. It'll be dark soon. - Well, keep me posted. - OK. Thanks. - What is it? - Do you speak Hungarian? Almost as well as I speak Chinese. Why? The last number Fitzner called belongs to a Hungarian landfill. - OK. And? - And nothing. Hello? Zeiler? Why me? - Luna, are you coming? Dinner's ready. - Look, Mom, there's a... - Hey, sweetheart. - Daddy's home! Hello, how was your day? Did you have fun? Yes, and you know what? I know what want from the Easter Bunny for Easter. - But Easter isn't until next year. - Then for Christmas. - A Christmas gift from the Easter Bunny? - No. - OK, what do you wish for? - A dog. That's a great idea. But now we'll have dinner. Come. She's sleeping. Hey, what's the matter? Do you remember Oliver Garchinger? Your ex's brother? Exactly. He died six weeks ago. No. Lung cancer. Oliver, of all people. Only six months ago he took over the forester ship. It was in the papers. Yes, you showed it to me, I remember. We said we'd take Luna there one day. And suddenly he's dead. And now his father... unbelievable. 12-year-old survives sailing accident Here. Yes, the train just came in. Good, give Zeiler the coordinates and tell her I can't come right now. Because I can't, Komlatschek Do you see him? Thanks, I got it. Damn it. - Hello, Micha. - Hello, Mrs. Garchinger. Hey. - So you're a policeman. - Yes. How is he? Well, he's still alive, but... - How is he? Mrs. Garchinger, I'm sorry. Did you give him his insulin? He's diabetic. We did, and we're doing all we can to alleviate his suffering. Doesn't he have any chance? - No, your husband will die, very soon. - Can we see him? - Of course. But he will probably not recognize you anymore. Forensics are on their way. - Did you find any more of those traps? - Four of them. - Probably from a poacher. - On both sides? Only on our side, actually. In the Viennese count's forest. I'm sorry, Mr. Fitzner. Is it true that Garchinger had rabies? Is that why he's killed my father? Will that count as mitigating circumstance? Mr. Garchinger is dying. - At least that's something. What was my father doing there anyway? - Is the name 'Hidegkuti' familiar to you? - Hidegkuti? That's pretty much the opposite of this. It's a mafia-run landfill in Hungary. Your father called there four times last week. Impossible. We don't do business with people like that. The number that starts with 00 36. Does your father have any skeletons in the closet? Skeletons in the closet? Do you think that's appropriate? Something from the past involving Garchinger, perhaps? - Did he have to free himself of something? - I really don't know. I'm terribly sorry about Oliver. I.. I didn't hear about it. My father wanted to keep it private. We didn't even place an obituary notice. Damn cancer. You can ask your questions if you want, Micha. - Shouldn't we go outside? There's no one else here. Ok. Did he tell you anything having to do with Ferdi Fitzner, the recycling man? Ferdi Fitzner? Absolutely. They were friends in the 90s. They used to tinker with old cars. And recently? No. Can you explain why he didn't get himself vaccinated? After all, it was his own dog that bit him. - Xena bit him? - I assume she was the carrier. My father wouldn't go to a doctor even if his arm had come off. Sorry, that was disrespectful. But it's true. Sepp didn't even come to the hospital when the children were born. - Why not? - Conviction. "Nature gives and nature takes, he always said. He treated his lung cancer with stinging nettle tincture. - Can we stay at our house? - No, I'm sorry. It's sealed off. - For how long? - In one week it... Excuse me, please. We'll have to find a hotel, Mom. Rabies? That explains a lot. The man who did this, if it was a man, because a woman... It could be a woman, of course. Sexual equality. - It was a man. - How many bodies have you examined? - I've seen quite a few in my life. Also, during my training and residency. Here, it's my second. I'm sure you know what you're doing. Please. The perp must've been drunk. All these bruises here, five broken ribs. He's been kicked and hit, apparently with a blunt object. - A rifle butt, perhaps? Yes, could be. And then there in his head... that was probably the ax. He must've dodged it, like this. Which is why the ax only grazed him. Then he probably tried to protect himself like this with his arm... then it came off. - And then he fled and fell into that trap? Exactly. Which is incredible, as he would've died from his injuries anyway. But the adrenaline must've given him the strength to flee. I've never seen such a case. If you have any more questions, call me, anytime. You see? Here's my motto, 'Day or night, I cling like a mite.' That's great. Thanks. You're welcome. So the forester, Sepp Garchinger, probably got infected by his dog. The illness set in and in a delirium he attacked Ferdi Fitzner with an ax. Fitzner fled to the forest, fell into a poacher's trap and bled to death. I doubt the trap was from a poacher. I'd like to question the Count about it. A visit to his manor? Yes, we can do that. But Count aside, we have the victim, the perpetrator, the murder weapon... with the rabies, even a kind of motive. Nevertheless, some questions remain. Why did Garchinger have 100,000 euros in cash? Why did Fitzner Sr. secretly take a delivery van to go to Garchinger? Have your inquiries led to something? The Hidegkuti landfill is a junk landfill to the north of Budapest that belongs to the mafia. I called there and talked to two people, but they didn't know anything, of course. I've applied for assistance from our Hungarian colleagues. Thank you, Komlatschek. - I'm not finished yet. This is a sales agreement we found among Oliver Garchinger's papers. - That's old Garchinger's son. - He wanted to sell the house? No, the entire forest, all the way to the Austrian border. - And the buyer? - The Count of Hochheim. - Did you know about that agreement? - Yes, Oliver told me about it. Every few months that weird Count sent a new agreement with ever higher sums. But you didn't want to sell? - Olli did, but my father was against it. But after the diagnosis he no longer cared. Did you talk about it after Olli's death? It was impossible to discuss it with him. What will you and your mother do now? Believe it or not, we haven't talked about that yet. Is there any news? Actually I wanted to know how you were doing. -In all honesty. Who wants to know? Micha or the Inspector? Micha. - A few words over the phone won't suffice. - Sure, I understand. Is the Sterntaler still there? Yes, but it has a leak. But we don't have to take it out. No. Shall we meet there tonight at 8:00 pm? OK Good, see you then. - What? - Nothing. - What was that look for? - I didn't look. Yes, you gave me a look. The inspector. And you're the assistant? Close. Inspector Oberlander, German-Austrian Crime Division. Sounds interesting. Perfect timing. Maybe you can dissuade him from his folly Thank you. Coming along to hunt? 1,000 euros for whoever shoots the rabid beast. The lord of the house Without a doubt. Why do I have a forest if I can't go hunting in it? I assume you have a permit. - I sure do. It dates back to the days before morals and peace entered my life. Is this also from those days? I installed the traps last year. Ten of them, because of the wild boars. All far away from the paths, where no one has any business. Do you want to arrest me for that? - Maybe later. Why did you go to Sepp Garchinger? For a neighborly visit. To have a chat, drink some tea. Do you only drink tea or do you actually meditate as well? You bet on it! This woman and meditation have saved my ass. I lived in Vienna and worked in finance. Alcohol, coke, vodka, whores, to no end. And then came the big bang. Burnout, panic attacks, cardiac arrest. The whole shit. And what came after the burnout. The bang and the whole shit? My father. Off to the happy hunting ground. - And I inherited this place. Fate. Thanks. But I'm sure you didn't just come because of the traps. You have something on the burner. I can smell it. You know Fitzner is dead and Mr. Garchinger is dying? Of course I do. That increases your chance to acquire the forest. - Is that German humor? - Show them our plans. Those tall spruces over there mark the boundary between my property... and the Garchingers'. Here, under the barn of the forester's house, is a water vein with spring water. A real healing spring, understand? And we want to tap it. "Shambala, the endless wellness oasis." But it's their home. - The agreement was more than fair. - I can print it for you. - We already have it. When did you last contact Mr. Garchinger? A few months ago. After his son got sick and died, I let it rest for a while. Mourning period. Then I gave it another try. - A neighborly visit. - That was no lie. - Are the traps included in the plan? - Yes. Here, the small red crosses. When did you last clear the traps? - A week ago. The dog? - Yes, let's get the little mutt. No, you'll print it out for us and then you'll stay right here. OK, but only if you come back this evening. Introduction to meditation, and the best vegan food north of the equator. - How about 8:00 pm? - Smashing. Are you serious? That was the last one. - Yes, shit. Why do you want to 'meditate' with that lunatic? - Why not? - He just wants to screw you. Jealous? - Me? Nonsense. But he has most to gain from Garchinger's death. - I think he knows more than he says. - So do. That means you're only going there to find out more. - Just like you this evening. - What do you mean? - Sterntaler? - Hold on, that's different. - Verena and I went to school together. - Ls your wife coming too? She also went to school with her. Aim for the leg. Yes, Komlatschek? And that's why you call me? The Hungarians agree to lend assistance. No, but we just saw the dog. I'll give you the coordinates. Still no luck? Damn it. OK, talk to you later. - The dog? - Yes, that animal's like a phantom. Don't let Luna wander off too far. - Hey, are you leaving again? Yes, lots of paperwork to do. - At least eat something. - I'll get something on the way. Nonsense, I made dinner. - I have to go, dear. I'm sorry. - I'll pack you something. - Yes, all right. I can't fathom it. What happened to your father, you mean? That you're standing before me as a married man. What should I have done after you broke my heart? Enter a monastery? You told me you weren't the type for a family and children. "I might as well reserve a grave." - Did I say that? Yes, you did. Well, people change over the years. Even if you can't imagine so at that age. And what became of your big dream? The surf school in Rainbow Bay? - You remember that? - Of course. That's why you wouldn't go steady with me. Hold on, you broke up with me. After you told everyone you were going to go to Australia. Without telling me about it. Ask Oliver, he was there. Shit. That happens to me all the time. Daddy's not answering his phone. Is what you told me really true? It's very important that you don't fib. Yes, I really saw that dog and I want it for Christmas. Let me try the station. German-Austrian Crime Division, Inspector Komlatschek. This is Kim Oberlander. Can I speak to my husband? -He's not here. When did he leave? He hasn't been here since this afternoon. - Hello? - Thank you, that'll be all. Daddy's on his way. I'll tell him everything. Go brush your teeth. I'll be right there. - Police officer. No one would've thought. - No. And you? Marburg, what was it, philosophy and German studies? Yes, but only two semesters. It wasn't for me. - Now I'm a dentist. - A dentist? OK. After that disaster with German studies I decided to study medicine instead. Maybe also out of protest against my father. Anyway, in Marburg there was a spot available in dental medicine... so I decided to study that. When did you come back? Shortly after Oliver's diagnosis. I can't imagine what my mother would've done without me. Or me without her. All those quarrels with my father about chemotherapy. What did the doctors say? What were his chances? - Can we please change the topic? - Yes, sure. - Weren't you going to the bathroom? Yes, I was. I got lost on the way back. - Dinner's ready. - Great, let's go. - Aren't you coming? - I'm staying here. I have work to do. - Is this your office? - Yes, the front room. - You really don't want to join us? No. Whatever you intend to do tonight, don't mind me. I think and live in other spheres To life. - Or do you drink to death in your trade? - Rather to life. Very delicate. Tell me, is it true that you never forget the first corpse you see? It's definitely true for me. It was my mother's and I was twelve. Why did you invite me? An honest answer? A feeling. - Magic. - I don't understand. A feeling we'd understand one another. - How, when you're not honest to me? - I am honest. You said you'd stopped pestering Garchinger lately. But at his home, we found this. Why would it be mine? What would forensics find out if they compared the chalk on the wrapper... With that from your office? OK. You got me. I didn't want trouble with the police. OK, yes, I approached him again. - When? Barely a week ago. - And? - He said he'd sign. If I paid him 100,000 cash in advance. Under the table, of course. - I did so that same day. - Just like that, 100,000 euros? And three days later the greedy bastard called again. He wanted another 100,000 - Goon. - I suggested that he'd sign first. That's why I went to see him. Now you know everything. - Hello? And our date? - It wasn't one. And my money? The 100,000. Where can I pick it up? Life is strange. You take a turn somewhere, suddenly you realize you can't go back anymore, only go straight ahead. I'm sorry. I guess there were some things I didn't understand at the time. More than you think. Where were you all this time? - At the station. A lot of hassle with the corpse. Pathology, Forensics, you know. - Sure. - Honey, I'm sorry. It's a tough case. - I tried to reach you. - Really? My battery was dead. What was it about? Luna said she saw a dog in the yard, and that it suddenly disappeared. Shit. You idiot And he told you the whole shit just like that? He sure did. Why did Garchinger suddenly agree to sell after all? Who could've taken over the forest? His aged wife? The rebellious daughter? No, he didn't have any other option. But why the 100,000 euros in cash, and a few days later the same amount? The sale would've given him millions I don't get it. Maybe he needed the money to be able to sell the forest at all. Yes, maybe because not all's well in the forest. Yes, the delivery van, the mafia landfill, the cash. Of course. They buried hazardous waste in the forest And the Count with his healing spring couldn't find out, of course. I got it. I just had the colleagues from Budapest on the phone. They visited the Hidegkuti landfill. Believe it or not, that's the key to the whole case. Let me guess. Fitzner Sr. was going to dispose of toxic waste for Garchinger. They asked for 100,000 euros. When they heard that it involved... - Highly concentrated PCB. - Exactly. When they heard that, they asked for 200,000 and the deal fell through. How do you know? There must be something here. Do you recognize it? Yes... It was on my father's desk. He must've been looking at it shortly before his death. I hadn't made the connection and didn't think about it, but now.. We'd been travelling around and wanted to fly home from Naples. My father said he still had work to do and would come later with a rental car. He arrived in the middle of the night three days later with a transporter full of barrels with these same hazard symbols on them. - And then? - And then? Then nothing- We have a recycling company. It wasn't unusual. That was highly concentrated PCB. Oh my God. And you found it at Garchinger's? - How much did he get for it? - A lot, I'm sure. A whole lot. But why did Garchinger store it in his barn? What do you think? Because my father hadn't told him how dangerous it was? What does that mean? - Mrs. Garchinger... It means, for years you and Oliver lived with that toxic stuff on your property. Since 1996. - When was that alleged lottery win? - September '96. - How much was it? - 50,000. He used it to buy the boathouse. That damn boat gave you cancer. Hold on. You too? Thyroid. I'm sorry, I didn't know... Excuse me. Yes? I understand. Thanks. He's dead. Have you finished the puzzle? Luna? Luna? Luna? Luna! - Hello, Kim. - Verena? You have a cute daughter. Good boy. Pretty odd, isn't it? Detaining a dog as a suspect. Oh, well. We have the wrong one. "The dog shows no signs of rabies. She'll be kept in quarantine for ten days. "But infection with a rabies virus can be virtually ruled out." What? The dog was never infected. I'm done. It's cute. - Good night, Mommy. - Good night, sweetheart. Sleep well. I always wanted children, too. It can be pretty stressful at times. Unfortunately, I don't know about that. - It's still possible. No, that's long over. Wanted to, but Micha didn't You were still very young. When we had Luna, Micha was already in his early thirties. I was 17 at the time. After the abortion, when the doctor asked if I wanted to know what it was, I was so stupid as to say yes. Imagine, Luna would've had an older brother now. Kim? Hey, honey. Hello, Verena. - You told me it was a high school fling. - Kim, I didn't know about this, really. Let's let the past rest. As I told you at the boathouse last night... Last night? - You went to investigate at the boathouse? - Kim, I... I had a shitty day and the dog we've been looking for doesn't have rabies. - Kim. - You found Xena? Yes, in perfect health and fit as a fiddle. - Shit. - So what does that mean? What it means? That we'll have to turn your house and estate inside out again. Maybe we'll find a rabid bat or something. I'm sorry. Also about this whole mix-up. Verena, don't be mad, but I'd like to be alone with Kim. Of course, I understand. Can I briefly go to our house? I need some things from my room. It's a crime scene, damn it. Is that so hard to understand? I'm sorry. Just go there early tomorrow morning, after 9:00 am. Forensics will be there. I'll let them know. OK. All right, bye. Come on, open the door. Let's talk. Oh, God. You're the last thing I need right now. Did Verena Garchinger tell you about her boyfriend? Yes, she told me she has one. No, I don't know what his job is. Dr. Daniel Sandrock works at Marburg University's Institute of-Virology. And why are you telling me this? We still have no explanation for how the virus entered Garchinger's body A virus as murder weapon. What could be more perfect? Verena was on a cruise. Not her boyfriend, with access to viruses. - We should have a word with him. - Forget what I said. What? Why? He's been at a research station in the Arctic for the last six months. - The things some people do. - But just now you said... Hello? Zeiler? Man, I really hate that Forensic Medicine 'Day or night, I cling like a mite.' You're still awake? - Xena doesn't have rabies. - I know, they told me. What's the matter? If Xena had been infected as well I'd never have thought of it. What do you mean? The last time I came to Marburg and we ordered Chinese takeout. I paid with your wallet. I remember wondering why you had an access card to Daniel's lab... while he was in the Arctic. - I'm sorry I called you this late. - That's fine, I'm happy to do this. This isn't just a job to me, it's a mission. A calling. I'm sure you feel the same way. - What happens if you go on vacation? - I can still be reached at all times. No, that's not what I mean. Do you hand in your chip card? No, why should I? Then anyone who visits your house can take the card and come in here. Why would they? No one I know wants to come in here voluntarily- No, nothing there. All visible wounds and scars are old. I mean, really old. A number of years rather than just one or two. Nothing fresh, I'm sorry to say. - What does that mean? It makes it harder in terms of evidence, but medically it doesn't signify anything. You can also get rabies from a tiny scratch that doesn't leave any trace. At the most, very briefly and microscopically. What's that? Punctures from an insulin pen. He was diabetic. Why is that one different? He must've been scratching himself there - It may indicate paresthesia. - What does that mean? Well, in purely theoretical terms.. That the rabies virus and the insulin entered his body in that same spot. Paresthesia is prone to occur in puncture wounds. No, that can't be. Insulin contaminated with a rabies virus, that's complete crap. No, thank you, you've been great help. No, it really makes no sense. Micha. Was Verena afraid we'd find it this time? Why Verena? - This is all mine. - Mrs. Garchinger, don't do it. Don't take the blame. You won't get away with it. Micha... You've known her for such a long time. You know she's a good person. You can make sure no one finds out. Mrs. Garchinger, you know I can't do that. Yes, Micha, you can. - You have to. - Did she know about the barrels? After Oliver's death he started drinking a lot. And one night in a drunken state he may have confessed it to her. - Why didn't he go to the police? - I don't know. Please, Micha, I beg you. Please let her go. Mrs. Garchinger... I'm sorry. - Mom? - Come here, I've done something terrible. Don't worry, Micha, nothing will happen to you. As soon as Verena calls from abroad and tells me she's safe, I'll let you go. You'll get an antidote at the hospital. Rabies doesn't incubate that fast. Then everything will be fine. This is the voicemail of Micha Oberlander. Please leave a message after the tone. - Kim Oberlander. - Zeiler. Is my colleague there? I thought he was with you. When did he leave? - No idea. I didn't hear him this morning. He must've left at least two hours ago. Is anything wrong? If you see him, have him call me. Do you know where Oberlander is? Inspector Komlatschek? No, why? - Hotel Reiter, how can I help you? Verena Garchinger, please. Mrs. Garchinger checked out and was picked up by a taxi. - Do you know where she went? - To the train station, I believe. Where is he? Who? Don't play games with me. I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean. Verena Garchinger, you're under arrest on the suspicion of murder and abduction. Oberlander? Oberlander? Shit. Hello? Verena, where are you? Do you hear me? Verena? Imagine, the police have arrested me. Mom? Inspector Komlatschek here. Have you heard from your husband? Not yet. I've called everywhere, even his father. No one knows where he is. Do you happen to know a Verena Garchinger? Yes, but I can't reach her either. Is there anything that comes to mind in relation to her? A name, a person, a place. Anything that comes to mind. Sterntaler. The murder of your father is one thing. You were in shock. The toxic waste, your dead brother. That's all mitigating. Kidnapping a cop is another matter. No interruptions. If you want Micha to be rescued, then let my daughter go. I infected him with rabies. The more time you let go by, the more he'll get sick. You don't seriously believe I'll fall for extortion, do you? Will you explain it to his wife and daughter? I don't care. I only have a few months left to live anyway. It must've been very special. What? - Your childhood romance. What makes you say that? He was very excited about your appointment. - I'd never seen him that way. - I see. I don’t think he could've imagined you'd let him die. But you can prevent it. - Me? What do I have to do with it? - He's your colleague - So? I'll get a new one. I couldn't stand him anyway. But you know what? You can tell his wife and daughter yourself what you're up to. Mrs. Oberlander? Zeiler speaking. Could you get Luna on the phone, also? Verena Garchinger and her mother have something to tell you. Yes, I'll put you through. It's over, Mom. -I will tell you where you'll find Micha. Verena, no. When he was alone for a few days, my mother labeled his vials for him I injected the virus in the dose for the first day. I hoped it would go faster and he'd be dead by the time we came back Then the incident with Fitzner wouldn't have happened. Although, he did pick the right one. - So you acted alone? - Yes, it was all my doing. My mother only found out yesterday. And then she wanted to protect me as best she could. The way mothers do. Unfortunately, it was too late. Life is strange? You take a turn somewhere, continue driving and suddenly you realize you can't go back anymore, only straight ahead? Sorry. Interesting transcript. Calling my wife was a great idea. Nice work. Funny she didn't tell me. She must've forgotten. - Yes, I guess so. An easy thing to forget This is definitely my favorite part. Gabriele Garchinger: "He's your colleague.: Inspector Hannah Zeiler: "So? I'll get a new one I couldn't stand him anyway. - Isn't that sweet? - The truth often gets you furthest. I love you too, Ms. Zeiler.
