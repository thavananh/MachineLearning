Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- The thunder gods will steal my belly button! Are you that scared of lightning? Because it is so sudden. And then it goes, "boom!" I hate loud sounds! Then why don't you cover your ears? If I use my hands for that, they will steal my belly button! It's logical if you think about it! What's logical about it? Local trains. I will hide my belly button, so please cover my ears, Kaguya. Okay. TRAIN SERVICES ARE CANCELLED The trains are canceled because of the typhoon! That's not good. You should call home. My family doesn't have a car, so they can't help me. What will I do? I see. I should offer to drive him home. President, if you'd like... Oh, that would be like... a driving date! Driving date. That is certainly also a kind of date. Shoulders touching in a tight space, listening to the pleasant FM radio, driving through the city while talking about this and that. And then at a red light... It would be so nice if the light didn't turn green and we could stay like this. That's what she would think. Strictly speaking, they wouldn't be alone because Kaguya's driver is there, but for Kaguya this would be a drive date. In short... It hurts, that hurts! Then I would be inviting him on a date! -What's wrong, Shinomiya? -Nothing. Nothing at all. It would be better if it came from the president. There's no way I can invite him like that. But to let him find his way home when he has no means of transportation... That's right! There would be no problem if he would ask me to drop him off! It seems that my taxi is coming soon. I see. I'm screwed... Eh? Doesn't he have a way to go home? It seems so. Then let me drop... A lightning stroke outside! I will cover your ears so you can't hear anything. Thank you. While I'm at it, I will cover your eyes as well. Why do you have to do that? Well, then. -I'll bring you to the taxi like this. -Wait a minute, Kaguya! It's scary! But also, a little fun! What game are they playing? Well, now that the most troublesome kid has gone home, I won't be bothered. But how do I get him to ask me to drop him off? This is bad, I still have to go to my part-time job. I will lose a shift if this continues. That's right. To miss a shift because of a typhoon would disqualify you as a working adult. You could either call a taxi that costs as much as you earn per day, or you could ask somebody to drop you off. It's an obvious choice for any true grown-up, right? This was efficient. I will think about it on the way to the toilet. Please do so. Is hard to imagine that the cheapskate president would call a cab. Then, naturally, he would come bowing to me as clear as day. I won this round! Forty-five dollars. With a salary of nine dollars per hour, that means five hours of work. But I don't want to miss my shift! Oh, no! The trains are running again! What's up with this timing? Try a little harder, typhoon! There's nothing else left to do but that. The Seven Anti-Shirogane Measures, number one. The rechargeable battery is dead. Kaguya always plans for every possible situation. She has prepared traps to trick Shirogane with. This rechargeable battery is one of them! I have about a minute until the president comes back from the toilet. I have to change his battery in that time. The time is very short and the degree of difficulty is very high, but I can do it! What's wrong, Shinomiya? Nothing, I'm doing a light exercise. My battery died? Hey, can I use your phone? My car has also come to pick me up. Excuse me. See you tomorrow. If I just wait here... Shinomiya, are you going back by car? Please! Can you give me a lift, please? Since you're asking so passionately, I cannot refuse you. I will bring the miserable president home. Are you a god? Ms. Kaguya. That's quite a cute plan, but how will I be able to go home? By walking? Are you a devil? If you don't cherish me more, you will get your punishment. You with your punishments... I told you. I was kidding. Of course, I called a taxi for you, Hayasaka. Damn it! I also... saw this coming. Then you should have stopped me sooner. I will skip school today, too. I'll be back. I'll just make you a porridge. No! Stay with me, Hayasaka! It's too bad. You're not usually this cute. Shinomiya caught a cold? Continuing to the nerve-racking incident of the home visit. It's good! This phone can do a lot of things. It's great! SHIROGANE'S SECOND-HAND SMARTPHONE WITH NO INSURANCE GOT A NEW BATTERY. It seems that Shinomiya has caught a cold. That means we have to bring her the handouts. I will go! Secretary Fujiwara? I only visited her when she was sick once. When Kaguya is sick, she totally acts like a pampered child! Pampered? President, can you please wipe my back? She's really cute! You know? You can hug her as much as you want and she won't get mad. President, hug me tightly! But visiting her alone would be unfair. Let's all go together. All of us? Yes. Visiting a sick person in a large group would be senseless. I think it's enough if one person goes. I'm scared so I don't want to go. Well, that's true. Who should go, then? Let's decide by playing a memory game. Memory game. As everyone knows, it's a common game. We won't use jokers. And if someone is caught cheating, he will lose five points, okay? Let's decide who starts with rock-paper-scissors. President, start the game! Let's start! I caught you, Secretary Fujiwara! What is it, President? Well, there are several frustrating things. First is that you would challenge us to a memory game. That is a little strange for this occasion. Usually, you would pick a game you are more skilled at. Then you mentioned so nonchalantly that anyone who cheats should lose five points instead of being instantly disqualified. That made me cautious. If you hadn't said anything, I probably would have missed it. What are these signs that look like numbers? These are playing cards for cheating! Is that true? Fujiwara, you're an underhanded cheap shot! Then you got caught by the tactic you used to cheat! You're so shameful! That's so embarrassing! If it were me, I would go home. -Shame! -That's enough, Ishigami. We agreed on how to punish someone who cheats and this is behavior is also within the rule. It's fair because we only touched them. That's right! If I haven't been caught in the act, then it's not cheating! No, you were caught. Starting over. In the first half of the game, these corrupt but still talented players correctly identified the position of each card. Making no mistakes, they gathered all the points properly. Shirogane earned ten points, Fujiwara eight points, and Ishigami earned ten points. There are now 24 cards remaining. With this, I am in a tie with Ishigami. President, wipe the front, too. Please! As expected, you all have a good memory. So I'll make it a little harder for you! What? Changing the location! Moving the cards they desperately tried to remember is particularly a dirty strategy. POSITION CHANGE This is bad! I don't know where they are anymore. By changing the position of the cards, Fujiwara earned significantly more points. Finally, she got back the points she lost by cheating. Now, enjoy the game, everybody! Oh, no. I'm last. If this carries on, I won't get to see Shinomiya being a pampered baby. President, can you caress me? What gift should I bring her? I rarely have a chance to give her something! She got too drenched last night, it's no wonder she caught a cold. Drenched? Shinomiya? But she was driven home. Well, I just happened to see her. She was waiting for somebody outside the school gate. Could she have been waiting for me? I don't have any proof... If that's true, I shouldn't be thinking about pampered Shinomiya. I am idiot who thinks only about stupid things. In this case, it really should be me who's going to visit her. Don't think about stupid things! Concentrate! Thirteen. Thirteen! Damn it! If she wins, she'll get to have this, too! It was false. Is this just a normal mistake? No way! I see! It's your turn, President! Take this! And this! I win. Conclusion, first place goes to Shirogane. That was some fierce catch-up! Oh well, this is what happens when you understand the trick. The trick? These cards are special because the patterns on them aren't symmetrical. That's why you can use them like this. That's right! They look like numbers on a watch. Yes. If you place them at the right angle, they can show the numbers one to twelve. And the card number thirteen was problematic, so Fujiwara put it farthest away. The position change was also meant to hide this trick. Fujiwara. You're a cheater! Underhanded! A cheater! You don't learn at all! You should be ashamed! Where do you get such shamelessness? And then he beat you by discovering how you cheated? That's the most embarrassing! So shameful. That is so shameful, Fujiwara! Don't look at me! I just... I just wanted to visit Shinomiya! I want to die, so I'm going home. Is that so? But please don't die! And yet I somehow managed to trick my sisters through that. She really is a cheater! Is that why they say that analog gamers are superficial? It's like she fell into her own trap. This happens when you do something that doesn't suit you. I wonder if this is how Shinomiya learned. If it were Shinomiya... Oh, crap. I'm getting a little nervous. What should I give her? I want to eat canned peaches, Hayasaka. Sure. The sickbed visit continues in part two. TODAY'S RESULT, BOTH OF THEM LOST BECAUSE NEITHER OF THEM HAD A STRATEGY. Is this the famous Shinomiya villa? I saw it on the internet, but it's even more amazing in real life. I probably should have brought more than drinks and jelly. I am responsible for the care of Ms. Kaguya. My name is Smithee A. Hayasaka. I am pleased to make your acquaintance. COLORED CONTACTS A LITTLE PADDED It's a maid! I see you have come to visit Ms. Kaguya on her sickbed. Oh, yes. That's right. Then I will show you to her room, sir. Oh, no. About that... I only came to deliver these handouts to Shinomiya. If you could please give these to her, Ms. Hayasaka. Don't get spooked after you made it here. There, there. But, you know... No, no. I think it's best if you give them directly to Ms. Kaguya. But! Ms. Kaguya, you have a visitor. Hey! What are you doing, Ms. Kaguya? DIRTY! I can't find it. What are you looking for? Fireworks. Fireworks? Let's light some fireworks together, Hayasaka! No, we won't. I understand you get ahead of yourself because summer vacation is coming soon, but treating your cold is our priority. You're a meanie! I want fireworks! Never mind that, there is a guest here for you. A guest? It's the president! Why are you here? Oh, well... Are you living here now? Why am I not aware of that? No, I am not. I'm not living here! Ms. Hayasaka, what's this? According to Sigmund Freud, human behavior is determined by desire and reason. The human instinct constantly creates the id, and the ego has the role of controlling those desires. However, if one loses the ability to think that is at the base of the ego for some reason, one becomes a beast controlled by our id. In other words, you become an idiot. An idiot? People who usually use their brain as much as possible are most affected at times like these. At first glance, it seems like she's awake, but she is like a person in a dream. When she gets well, all of her memories during the time that she was sick will be gone. It's the same as being drunk. There she goes, saying strange things again. Well, I have to get back to work soon. I'll leave Ms. Kaguya in your care. I understand. Is it all right? Nobody will come into this room for about three hours. Under no circumstances should you do anything strange. I won't. Additionally, this room is completely soundproofed. Ms. Kaguya won't remember anything, if you did anything you wouldn't get caught. But you should absolutely not do anything weird. I'm telling you I won't! I bought several drinks for you. Do you want one? Fireworks? No, not fireworks. It's no use. I can't talk to her about anything serious right now. Honestly speaking, I was hoping I could help her drink or do other wicked things, but she really is weak. If I took advantage of this, I could find out what she really feels or what her weakness is, but... Shinomiya. Did you by any chance get sick because of me? Yesterday, you wanted to give me a ride, right? And that's why you were waiting at the school gate. I don't know. It feels like it's true but it also feels like it's not. Which is? Are you mad at me, President? I am sorry. No, you didn't do anything. No. I always cause you trouble. You know, I never know what I should do. It's my first time being in this kind of situation, so I really don't know what to do. That's why I only do it the only way I know how. I don't know any other way to do it. I can only do it like this. That's why today... let's sleep together. What? No, Shinomiya! Are you being shy? How cute of you. Wait a little! Shinomiya won't remember any of this and nobody will come in this room. This situation is too convenient! I am not sure I can control myself! Just what have I gotten myself into? ID EGO SLEEP-DEPRIVED What time is it? It feels like I've been sleeping for a long time. President! Why are you in my bed? I just came over... What kind of man who slips into a woman's bed without permission? But you invited me! There's no way I'd do that! How dare you get in while I was sleeping! You're the worst! Get out of here! Oh, my. I thought it would turn out like this. Well, it seems you had a good sleep. Hayasaka! How far did I go with him? It's not for me to tell. How irritating! It's so annoying that I can't stand it. I tried so hard to hold it back! The nerve-racking home visit incident comes to a close. Well, maybe you didn't do it. Subtitle translation by Maria Carbune
