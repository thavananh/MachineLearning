Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- I live in a tiny border village that's surrounded by nothing but canals. Mitten. For many generations, the legend of a mermaid appearing in our village has been passed down. They say whoever lays eyes upon it will have their love fulfilled. Hey, what do suppose "love" really is? What did you think, Mom? Hey Muru! Can you deliver this for me? Okay! Welcome to the Island of Bubbles. You guys are still at it, huh? Ain't nothing to do 'round here but fish fer mermaids. Oh? Well, I'd never be able to sit in one place for so long like that. Anywho, tell us more of that tale you were spinnin' yesterday. Yeah! Bring on Muru's wild imagination theater! Sure. But I can't stay for too long. Let's see... How far did I get? Our hero left his hometown and then... The part where the little pig's ship breaks down. Ah, the dramatic twist. The cornered little pig is on the verge of being hauled back to the farm and desperately throws up a prayer. Then, unbelievably, the sea splits right in two! What happens next... Aw, cripes. Was that whippersnapper at Georges' place asleep on the job again? Yo, Lupin. You okay? Ouch... When I saw that woman. I thought a mermaid had come ashore by taking a human form. So pretty! Whaaaat?! It's gonna take three whole days for them to fix that bridge?! Just our dang luck... Ow! That glossy chestnut-brown hair with curls, and eyelashes so delicate they look like they could fall off. Ah! I've never seen someone so beautiful! I'm sure of it, that Madame must be a mermaid in disguise who came ashore in search of love! The depths of the ocean are so dark and cold... Won't someone please show me where to find the warmth of love? Oh my gosh! Is that the Madame's lover...? "We finally meet again." "Oh Monsieur I never dreamed that you would pursue me all this way." "I keep my promises, babe." "When I said that I would never give up on you no matter what, I was dead serious." The Monsieur fell in love with the Madame at first sight and has traveled the world looking for her! That explains the lonely look in their eyes! You're out of your damn mind asking us to fork over 70% just because you provided the intel. We're the ones who busted our asses doing all the work. I bumped it up to include my travel costs back. I didn't expect that we'd end up being stranded on an island like this. After all Lupin did for you... Is Lupin still cooped up in that hospital bed? What's with all the coughing? I was informed this village has a single asian restaurant and went there to eat, but I was met with extra spicy Chinese foo... The Madame and Monsieur just had their conversation interrupted by an ailing Samurai?! "I beseech you, my beloved Madame. Please allow me to take you out on a date." "Who are you?" "My heart aches so deeply with love, that I traveled through many eras and countries just to reach you." "I am but a humble Samurai." "Watch it, pal. The Madame here already has me." "Nay. I am a better fit for the Madame." Sparks fly! Oh gosh! How will it turn out?! Which of her suitors will the Madame choose to be with? That Samurai hasn't done anything except wander around. Could he be broke or something? I wonder if he's trying to cozy up to the Madame so he can mooch off her money. Taking a better look, perhaps he's actually a working student who just chooses to dress up as a samurai? He must be trying to save money on clothes to fully dedicate himself to the pursuit of knowledge! Is he a history major? Or physics? No! It must be astronomy! Madame... your eyes glimmer with a light greater than that of any star in the universe! You flatter me. Let us connect the night lights into a new constellation. A secret one known only to us that goes by the name of "Madame"! It will become the proof that our love is eternal! Oh, my darling! What a splendid romance! Trust me, Madame. This man will surely provide the warmth of love that you seek, even if he is poor! Meanwhile, I can't even begin to imagine what the Monsieur here is like. He looks scary enough I wouldn't want to upset him. I know! This guy just has to be a wandering musician! The power of music will melt your frozen heart and deepen our bond with each other. Madame, allow me to play a song to convey my love to you. Oh my, how sweet you are! Ah! That must be a present for the Madame. The Monsieur is clearly a romantic! Wait, this is a... A gun shop?! Oh my gosh! Is he going to kill his rival in love? No! I know people will do anything for love, but this is too far, Monsieur! Oh no! This can't be happening! There's nothing to do. I'm so bored I was about to have somebody service my magnum. I have an idea that may help. A-are they going to duel?! Sorry to cut your break short. It's not a problem. Just settle in and I'll have you to a town with an airport in three hours tops. D-did you say three hours?! Well, I suppose anything's better than being here. Sure. Why are they fishing? Well, there's nothing else to do around these parts except sleep and fish I'm afraid. -Any bites today? -No. That figures. The competition is always fierce because we got mermaids livin' in these waters! Mermaids? Even interest in the mermaid legend has died down since only a handful of pitiful folk believe it now. Mermaid legend? Not a single damn fish. It seems we should have taken those old-timers more seriously. What's going on? I'm glad they aren't dueling each other, but. I must say time spent "doing nothing" is rather enjoyable. Heh. You ain't wrong. I get it. Those two must be trying to catch the Mermaid Fish right now! To show the Madame, and prove how much they love her. -Guess what, Lupin? -This village has a legend. It says a mythical ancient fish lives here that can grant people fulfilling love lives. Ancient fish? Ow, my neck... Yes! A long time ago, there was a world-famous collector named King Breward who supposedly caught and released that ancient fish of legend. They called it the "Mermaid Fish". Mermaid I guess that explains all of the mermaid décor they use around this town. As I understand it, the king was praying for the recovery of his ailing wife and that's what motivated him to release the fish back into the sea. I guess the legend of the "Mermaid Fish" just became a mermaid over time. Is that so? Sounds like fun! Let's go on a little hunt of our own and find this mythical fish! But dude, your neck... Whatever, we're stuck here until the bridge is fixed with nothing better to do. And did you hear that bit about "fulfilling love"? It's a perfect fit for me and Fujiko! You read my mind! It turns out, there's a rumor going around that the fish will show up on the night of a full moon. -Oh yeah? -And get this, tomorrow's a full moon! Talk about lucky! Please help me, Muru. The Monsieur or the Student. Which one do you think is the better fit for me? Um, well... So long as I have a partner who will truly love me, then I can live upon the surface. But... if our love is not to be, then I will... NOOOOO! She's stuck. I'm sure the Madame would have decided by now if she could, but the problem is she can't. The Monsieur and the Student... Both of them are attractive in two entirely different ways. Sorry, my bad! Hope you didn't wait long! Th-there's a third guy?! The tale shall continue! So what? Wh-what does this monkey face guy want with the Madame?! Hey, Fujicakes! I ever mention you're the love of my life? I gotta say, you look drop-dead gorgeous this morning! He's trying to hit on her, from the looks of it... Oh, cut the crap. Don't think I didn't see you trying to woo the girl at the front desk earlier. Aw, shoot. Did I make you jealous? Let me make it up to you with a big, ole smooc. That's what I thought. He's not a good fit for the Madame at all. Madame... Lupin's such a dumb-ass. He's never gonna learn. Indeed. I absolutely cannot fathom what part of Fujiko actually appeals to him. Love is an eternal mystery, I'll tell you what. Hey, you got a bite! Is it the Mermaid Fish? Them's the breaks. Keep it up, fellas. Not that there's any fish to catch. It's such a shame. They could have been best friends under different circumstances. Hi, little lady. You're quite the artist. Ah! You're the monke I mean, the guy who got slapped by the Madame earlier! Slapped? Oh, jeez. You saw that? N-not really... Well, that's the norm for us. C'MON MERMAAAAAID! Shucks... so much for fulfilling love... Hey, mister? Is love really all that great? Huh? I just don't get it. I mean, you can never be hurt if you never love someone, right? Well, little lady, you're tackling one of the greatest questions of all time. Huh? If you ask me, love is life itself. At times it makes you full of joy, and at others it leaves you totally empty. It's more exasperating than any treasure in existence, but totally worth taking the risk to obtain. For sure! But what happens if you fail to pick someone right for you? If you fall in love with the wrong person, it must cause big problems. Ah yes, when a love boat becomes lost at sea. Well, what I recommend you do in that case is listen very closely. Listen? Yeah, because I can tell you from experience love isn't something we can see clearly! Just like the legendary Mermaid Fish, swimming along the bottom of the sea! A fat lotta nothing... Hey mister! I know where it is! I can tell you where to find the Mermaid Fish! What? Really? Maybe... Whoa! Didja get it? Not exactly. "I will be waiting at Mermaid's Rim tonight." "Madame"? How curious. Does this have something to do with the Mermaid Fish? Yo, boys! I see that you caught wind of this place, too. Jeez, man. When the hell are you gonna stop letting her take advantage of you like this? C'mon, just take it easy. Look down there. That must be Mermaid's Rim. Your battle for love is over. Little lady? Thanks for coming, you three. I've arranged an opportunity for you all to convey your devoted love to the Madame tonight. Huh?! What about the Mermaid Fish? Wait, are you the one who sent this? Pure foolishness. I will be taking my leave now. Same. Wait! Look over there. Only those who successfully pass the trial of love will be allowed to see what's inside. Oh? So the Mermaid Fish is in there? Yo, let's just play along with the little lady for now. Okay? Whatever, man. Fine. But how do we pass this "trial of love"? All you have to do is be frank about how you feel! Bare the feelings kept hidden in you heart! Huh? To who? Ugh! To the Madame who you're all in love with, obviously! And who's that? Oh jeez! You guys are such thickheads! "I, uh, have been enamored by your beauty since I first saw you, Madame." Wh-what on earth is this? Shush! Don't interrupt! You can do it, Mr. Student! Right now, I am focused on following the path of my studies until I reach my goal. So being with me may force you into a life of frugality for some time to come. But even so, I want us to go together! On clear nights, I shall illuminate your beauty along with the stars. On rainy days, I shall string together words and offer you poems of love. Madame. I'll buy you whatever you desire, whether it be fancy clothes or beautiful flowers. And I'll play any music you wish. In return... Please allow me to have your mornings. I want to start my days with a freshly brewed cup of coffee and you by my side. Yes, just the two of us. The two of them! What is love? Why, it's magic, my dear! Madame... Just a single wish from you could turn deserts into forests, and thieves into angels that fly across the sky. Everything in the world belongs to you! Je t'aime! Wo ài ni! Ti amo! Ninakupenda! Smoochy, smoochy! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Both the future where the Madame and the Student gaze upon the stars, and the future where the Madame and the. Monsieur share words of love are so touching. That was a great show you fellas put on. -Yer quite the gentleman. -Made me cry! Good job, mister. You really put your heart into it, despite being at a huge disadvantage compared to the others. Oh? Does that mean we all passed the test? Are you going to let us take a peek at the treasure now? I'm sorry, mister. But I'm not the one who gets to make that decision. Huh? F-Fujicakes?! Here you are. What's this for, sweetie? Um, to be honest I want to offer you my help, Madame! We arranged it so that she could hear all of your heartfelt confessions of love. Now I turn it over to you, Madame. Who among these three are you going to choose? They all fail! Huh?! The power of love can't do jack shit. You said it. This has been an absolute humiliation. -Don't fret. -That's just how life goes. C'mon, the best spot fer night fishin' is down thataway. -A secret spot? -The fish actually better bite this time. Fujicaaaaaaaakes! Are you okay, mister?! He's fine. Lupin just never learns. It's kind of his thing. Lupin? Wait, you're really the famous Lupin? Yep. I'm the one and only Lupin III. I assume you've heard of me before. It's important not to forget what true love is. True? Love? You okay, missy? Yes. -Um, just thinking about love. -Okay. Well, let's both get out there and compete to see which of us can find true love the fastest. Ow! Anyways, I'm surprised you turned down both the Monsieur and the Student. Are you really okay with that? Oh, you mean those two? If you ask me, they haven't trained in the art of love enough yet. You really think so? By the way, Muru, sweetie can you show me to where the Mermaid Fish is now? Well... I actually don't know where it is. I've never seen it myself. I'm sorry! I lied... Seriously? Well, that's usually how most "legends" turn out. Boy, she was quite the outrageous little lady, huh? You can say that again. Oh? Well, I took a liking to her! I guess swindlers enjoy the company of other swindlers. Watch it! I'm driving here! Oh! I know! What if the Madame had actually been a spy? The reason she doesn't have faith in love is because of the many betrayals she's had to escape from. I hope that someday I can become a badass lady, too.
