She's the one who disappeared during the war. At the International Tracing Service they found this document certifying her existence. And my grandmother told me her mother was sent to Treblinka... Anyway, she died during the war but she never testified for her. That's why I want to testify for my great-grandmother. What is certain is that she was born in Lodz and spent her whole life there. - And your great-grandfather? - He died before the war. He was Bronislaw Goldbaum. He died before the war. So, there... And the children died? The children left in 1933. My grandmother left in 1933 for France to escape from... she understood that... And your grandmother was hidden during the war? - My grandmother in France? - Yes. No, she wasn't hidden because she had a name... my name which made it possible to be more or less safe. My grandmother died but she had never testified about her mother. Because we didn't speak about it. My grandmother didn't want to speak about it. On my father's side, my paternal grandfather died at Auschwitz. And he's on the Yad Vashem list. But on my mother's side... there's nothing. My great-grandmother who lived in Lodz died during the war but there's no testimony. That's why I've come here to testify about her. If I were the director of the Yad Vashem Museum, I'd have kept almost everything. Slightly changed... But near the exit I'd have left a dark room with a single inscription: Deir Yassin. "What's the connection?" Hardly 200 victims were murdered in the village of Deir Yassin in 48. May 48, I think. April or May? I can't remember. Can you compare that with six million? No, the problem isn't only the number. They're our victims. I wanted Yad Vashem Museum to be a museum with a message. Not only to say anti-Semitism, anti-Jewish racism was a fact, but that racism in general is at the root of this tragedy. The memory of the Holocaust can also serve to generate solidarity... Gadi Algazi, Historian, Professor at the Tel Aviv Universitiy and to identify with the suffering of others. I know many activists, young activists... I'm not young, but I'm still an activist, and for me, the fact that my mother survived the Holocaust, inspires a feeling of solidarity with the suffering of others and of the Palestinians, of course. When I went to Gaza for the first time, to the refugee camp with friends, I went with my father but my mother said the day before, "Go there but never forget that we too were refugees." It's another way... It's another way for the memory of the Holocaust to exist. Commemoration of the Palestinian village of Khubbayza, destroyed in 1948 I lived here till I was 7 and I hardly know the members of my family who are scattered around the world. But in Um el Fahem I am surrounded by you who are as dear to me as my parents. Thank God we have remained in our homeland, and I ask all the children of Palestine in all the camps, in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Gaza, and the West Bank, to remember always Testimony of Lea, an Israeli Jew, who didn't want to be filmed. Two months ago, a law was passed... I don't know if you've heard of it. A law forbidding any mention of the Nakba in any Israeli state-funded institution. It is forbidden by law. For me, it's like forbidding mentioning the Holocaust in France. Not that I compare the Holocaust with the Nakba. The Holocaust was an extermination plan the Nakba was a plan to evict people. It is completely different from a moral standpoint. The Holocaust and Nakba cannot be compared historically. But in terms of remembrance they are comparable. Someone else's suffering, someone else's remembrance should be important for you. In the same way that I insist non-Jewish French people should respect the Holocaust, should have the Holocaust imbedded in their memory, I insist that Israeli Jews should remember the Nakba. The founding of the State of Israel in 48 caused a tragedy for others. 700 000... 650 000 refugees had to leave their homes their villages, and their lands. One of the conditions for a possible peace between Israelis and Palestinians, Arabs... is the remembrance of the Nakba. To know, as each American knows that the White man chased the American Indian off his land, each young Israeli must learn... That it isn't just the Arabs who should remember the Nakba, but the Israeli Jews should too. And for me, as an Israeli of Jewish origin, and as an historian, whose work is remembering... That's what I do in my job, I construct memories. I build new memories, I reconstruct former memories. For me, it is shameful that the State of Israel, the State which supposedly is based on a memory of 2000 years ago should deny others the memory of what happened 62 years ago. You can imagine the abyss between the so-called Jewish morals, the remembrance of the Holocaust, the pogroms, the anti-Semitism... and the fact that in 2011 the State of Israel should prevent the Palestinians from remembering the Nakba. Especially since we are responsible for this tragedy. Without the memory of the Nakba, there will never be peace between Israelis and Palestinians, between Jews and Arabs. Sahar Vardi Student in History Meir Margalit Meretz MP in Jerusalem The Green House Tel Aviv University Campus Umar Ighbarieh Member of the Zochrot Association In this land where I live, where I have a flat, where I work at Tel Aviv University, there are four museums. One museum of the Land of Israel, a Museum of the Palmach, which was the precursor of the Israeli army. The Ytzhak Rabin museum, and a museum of the Jewish People, in the middle of Tel Aviv University. Four big museums. All these big museums are built on the land of this village. There is no plaque marking the spot where a friendly Arab village stood. If being Jewish at the beginning of the 21st century has any meaning it is in terms of remembrance. Remembrance of suffering, not only of one's own suffering but of the suffering of others, especially your own victims. That's why I end my new book with Sheikh Mouwanis. And if I were the President I would have transformed this Israeli academic club into a small museum for Palestinian refugees. The Jewish people had sovereignty over this land for more than a thousand years. Emmanuel Navon Member of the Likud It started 3000 years ago with an uninterrupted Jewish presence on this land. And this was well before the advent of Islam in the 7th century and the invasion of our country by the Arab armies in the 8th century. So, it hasn't always been this way. It started in the 8th century, more than 2500 years after un-interrupted Jewish presence, with an Arab invasion of our country, an Arab conquest of our country in the 8th century. The Arabs were just one group among others in this province of the Ottoman Empire, which wasn't Palestine, since it didn't exist then, it was a wilayah of the Ottoman Empire. And the total population of this region, which at the time was not called Palestine, was approximately 500 000 inhabitants. Not all of them were Arabs, there were also Jews who had been there for over 3000 years, generation after generation, there were Christians, Druze and all sorts of groups, it was a mix. You need only read Mark Twain who visited the Promised Land in 1867 and described it as a desolate empty land, since there was a population of 500 000. This population increased in the 19th century with the waves of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe and Yemen, from 1880. That's when a Jewish society began to emerge, different from the one which had been here thousands of years, a population of Jewish immigrants. After 20, 30, or 40 years, this established a new economic reality which in turn drew Arab immigrants from different countries. So, most of the Arabs themselves, were also new immigrants from neighbouring countries seeking work from what was called the Yishuv, the Jewish community in what was Palestine under the Turks and later the British. Therefore many Arabs who were in the British Mandate at the time of the partition plan, were immigrants. The only ones who had always been there were the Jews. Ran Kasmy Ilan Curator at the Israeli Digital Art Centre Elon Moreh Settlement West Bank Elon Moreh is one of the Yishuvim, one of the settlements established by the Gush Emunim, a group set up after the Six-Day War, to facilitate the settlement of Israelis in the reconquered territories. It started with the Merkaz Harav Yeshiva which swears allegiance to Rav Kook, who are a Zionist religious group, and with two people in particular who still live in Elon Moreh and who one day during their studies decided to put down their books and take action. They received the blessing of the Rosh Yeshiva who was Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kook at the time. They first settled the Jews near Hebron. - I see. - Once Hebron was properly started, there was Kyriat Arba they decided they should go to Shechem. Shechem: Biblical name for Nablus. Hebron is to the south of Jerusalem and Shechem is the equivalent to the north of Jerusalem. It is one of the three places which according to our scriptures, cannot be taken from us because they were bought with money. We have the deeds of sale. - Which date back to when? - To biblical times. The first place bought was the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, bought by Abraham, our ancestor, and the second, was Shechem which was bought by his grandson, Yaakov. The third one, was the place of the Temple, bought by David. Jerusalem was in our hands, Hebron too, and Shechem had to be populated. Next year you won't be in Jerusalem but in Nablus? Why next year? Tomorrow! The objective for you on this side, who see the town at the foot of the mountain... Did you say, there were 150 000 inhabitants? About 130. Do you believe it should... If you could choose, would you be there or here? To put it more clearly. Selfishly, I feel better here. But it's true we would like a Jewish settlement within Shechem, like in Hebron. We've always wanted that. There was a Yeshiva next to Joseph's tomb and the Oslo Accords provided for a continued Jewish presence, unfortunately in 2000 it was abandoned. Since then, people have to visit Joseph's tomb like thieves, in the middle of the night... It's an archaeological site? How are the visits done? I've never been. - It's a tomb. - A tomb. If I go down there, can I see it? If you're willing to risk it. It's dangerous? There are official visits. Like the day before yesterday which was a special day, there were 5000 people... - The army was there? - Of course. There was the army and the police... I see... Nablus, West Bank. If Abraham bought Shechem-Nablus, very well... But for me it's a legend. I don't believe the Bible is a history book. But if I'd been there next to you, if I'd been there and heard that answer, I'd have asked the following question: "If Abraham bought Shechem-Nablus and Hebron, "Al-Khalil, did he buy Jaffa? Tel Aviv? Haifa? Akko?" No. So if we follow the logic of the legend which this settler holds so dear, Abraham bought Shechem? Very well... We'll organise the world as follows: The places Abraham bought belong to the Jews. The places he didn't buy, that were conquered in bloodshed, and by killings, will belong to the Arabs. Which means that the greatest part of this land called Israel will be restored to the Arabs. Will he agree? Why didn't you ask that question? Israel can justify its existence only on one level: It was created because of the tragedy of the Jews in Europe, not because of any rights to the lands of Palestine. You must realise, from an historical perspective... And I appeal to the spectators to think of this. After 1800 years of absence, why should you have any rights to the land? If you were to rebuild or reorganise the world as it was 1800 years, you would have to throw the Francs out of France, and throw out all the immigrants because they arrived afterwards. You'd have to throw out all the Whites from the United States if you wanted to organise the world as it was in biblical times. Throw all the Whites out of Latin America and North America. Because the White Americans didn't buy the land. They colonised it. We also colonised the land, in the 20th century. We didn't buy the land. Did you know another Zionist legend, apart from us buying the land, was that the land was supposedly a desert? No... Up until 1948, after many attempts by the Zionists to buy the land, only 10% of the land was bought. The remaining 90% was taken by force. during the war in 1948, and in the slow process I mentioned earlier between 48 and 67-68. Organising the world as it was 2000 years ago would also justify the Serbs, for example... The Serbs say Kosovo belongs to them because they were there 200 years ago, not 2000 years! They killed and massacred people, because 200 years ago this land of Kosovo belonged to people who spoke a form of Serb. They were Christians, not Muslims. So, if you want to justify the Zionist colonisation of this land, you have to justify the Serbian massacres, because they wanted to keep their own land. East Jerusalem Demonstration against the colonisation of East Jerusalem Violences, arrests, our hope will not be broken! Settler, keep praying! God will not forgive you. Police and settlers, out of the houses! No! No to fascism! Say it in Arabic. Life in a cage! Life in a cage! Wall separating Jerusalem and the West Bank Lodz, Israel 22 km East of Tel Aviv The destruction was caused by the Israeli authorities on December 13th, 2010. A police task force was sent and a bulldozer destroyed the seven houses that belonged to the Abouhid family. There were 60 inhabitants, 32 of whom were children. It was a cold and rainy day in winter. And since that day, the children have remained traumatised. The reason invoked was that the houses stood on farmland. The State had given this land to the family in exchange for land they owned in northern Israel. They settled here, the family grew, they applied for a building permit but the State never gave it to them. At the time of the demolition, they didn't even give the people time to recover their belongings. That's the racist attitude of the State of Israel towards the Arab population. They want to do a second Nakba. And we are perfectly aware of this. Two young women were about to get married. The houses were destroyed so quickly that they couldn't gather their belongings. Behind we can see Gane Aviv, where they aren't demolishing because the people are Jewish even though they've built without a permit. Israel is the only country in the Middle East where the Arabs have rights. There are revolutions in Arab countries everywhere in the world. There are a million Arabs between Morocco and Iran who have rights thanks to Jewish State. Only the Jewish State gives civil rights to Arabs. - They are completely equal? - They are completely equal in the eyes of the law. It was an Arab judge who sent a former President to prison. You can't have greater equality. An Arab judge, at the court of appeal of Israel sentenced to 7 years in prison the former president Moshe Katsav on a charge of rape. The head of my department at the university is an Arab. There is complete equality before the law. It is true that in terms of the identity of the country the Jewish Nation-State does not express their national aspirations as Arabs. But the Danish Nation-State does not express the national and religious aspirations of the Arab-Muslim minority in Denmark. Denmark isn't expected to abandon its national identity just to please the Muslim or Arab minority. But the Arab-Muslim minority in Denmark has the same civil rights it is equal before the law. What is dangerous in the slogan of the Jewish State is that it confuses the legitimate rights of the Jews as a group... I as a Jew, I 'm a patriot, I love this country, I love the people who live here, I love this language, I love the Arabs and the Jews... But the slogan of the Jewish state masks the fact that there is an indigenous population, that there is another people living here. That Palestine is the... What we don't see is that beyond the conflict between Israel and its neighbours, the country is divided between two populations, and that in Israel itself, excluding Gaza or the West Bank, in Israel there is a national indigenous minority of Palestinians who also have rights as a group and as individuals. The State of Israel defined as a Jewish State conducts a campaign against its own citizens. If its citizens are Arabs they are considered... and this is nothing new, it has always been the policy of the Israeli establishment, which consists of considering the Palestinian minority as an internal enemy. And against this enemy there is a whole range of measures such as discrimination, which can be seen in universities or in the education system. But beyond a discrimination which we can change there remains a process of permanent dispossession which isn't yet over. If we talk about justice or the Palestinian problem, in Israel it isn't just in reference to 1948 as an established historical fact. We aren't just talking about the past. What is happening now in Jaffa or here in Ramla, in Lodz, in Akko or Jerusalem, is a process of dispossession. Through a combination of economic and administrative measures. The bulldozers and tanks are two manifestations of the same process.

No, but... - If it's you, that's few people. - No problem. - If you are the only ones, that's only 10 people. Sahar Vardi Student in History Have the Arabs behaved so badly in the Arab world towards the Jews? The life of Jews in Arab countries is described as one of constant persecution. No, it's well known that it isn't true but I don't think it's worth talking about. There would be too much to analyse. Or we might repeat clichés which aren't defendable because there is a constant idealisation of the co-existence of Arabs and Jews, a Judeo-Muslim co-existence. And at the same time, there is a demonization of Muslim traditions right now with the demonization of Islam. I'd rather not go into that. I believe it's always possible for people to build a future together as equals. That's all. There are many examples of people who have done this. What counts for us is not only the hope of living together with the Arabs as equals. Among the different groups of the left-wing opposition in Israel this is already the case. In our work in the occupied territories with Palestinian popular resistance, we've already felt that we were working together. That we were able to conceive a possible future that went beyond the partition walls, that went beyond racism in all of its forms. For my children, now in Israel, the experience of having Palestinian children and families, who are very close. Not only very close out of civility and politeness, but close because we have gone through things together because we tried to put up a resistance to the policy of discrimination together and we have found a few pockets, a few islands, not only of coexistence but of friendship and humanity. That's the real transformation in terms of awareness among the Jewish citizens of Israel. It's not just a question of talking to Arabs or of reading about Muslim societies but of experiencing life together. Israeli society is completely separated. In your daily life, if you are an Israeli Jew, you may never speak to an Arab. Unless you are giving orders to an Arab working in your home. But even that remains an exception. Even at the university there are groups of Arab or Jewish students but there is little dialogue between them as equals. There are many voluntary organisations which try to create opportunities for meetings and dialogue between Arabs and Jews. But ending this separation, working together, doing something, I believe is the best way of ensuring we have a future, that there is something to build here. In the 1950s in the United States, there was a discussion concerning whether segregation in the South between Whites and Blacks was racism. Is the fact of being separated a discrimination? I'm just talking of the fact of being separated. It is something concrete. There is a famous law in the United States which dates back to 1955 or 56, which states that people who are separated cannot be equal. If groups are separated in a society by law there is no equality. There is not just discrimination. That's what I wanted to say, and it's important to understand. "Separation is not equal", is what this law said which triggered off the fight for equality in the South of the United States from the end of the 1950s up until the 1970s. You must realise that without this law, which says "separate is not equal", Obama couldn't have become President at the beginning of the 21st century. In Israel... an Israeli of Jewish origin cannot marry a non-Jewish Israeli. Those who created this constitutional law in Israel were not religious people. It was Ben Gurion, the founder of the State of Israel. The one who agreed to give the Rabbis the right, the authority to decide about marriage. At the beginning of the 21st century a Jew cannot marry a non-Jew in the State of Israel, which means that this State seeks, fights for, and applies a policy of separation between Jews and non-Jews. I speak French... A little. Hasn't the existential problem of Israel always been the Arab question which has always been ignored? And Ahad Ha'Am in 1891, already said at the time what is often said about Israel that it was an arid land desolate and sparsely populated which is wrong in fact. There are people, Arabs, who see what we are doing, and when they understand our plan they will rebel. Isn't this problem the true existential problem of Israel? Absolutely. It's not really a question of knowing the land, of seeing the landscape, of seeing the people, the real question is recognising the people. It is the recognition of the Palestinians as a group not just as individuals. It is the recognition of their rights and this pre-conditions being able to live together. If you like, when Arafat Ismail said a few minutes earlier that the authorities look at me but I don't exist, I don't really exist as a citizen. As someone different, but who is a partner of this society. It is precisely the same colonial vision which has always remained at the heart of the Israeli policy in the occupied territories and even in Israel itself. Yudit, outside is nicer, isn't it? A major fear in Israel is of one day becoming a minority. In other words, if we don't continue this demographic war, this sort of domination over the Arabs... And that's maybe why it isn't very democratic because one day if there is equality, the Jews will be a minority. It won't be Israel anymore. I can answer that at two levels. You know I am politically very moderate. I'm not joking. The analysis is always radical concerning the situation, the history, etc. The political proposals are also projects... At that level, I think I'm very... How to put it? Liberal in a foolish way. What do I mean? The cultural fear... The Jewish-Israeli fear, I can understand. But the argument, "We've been Jewish for 3000 years..." No, culturally Zionism has created a society with specific cultural characteristics. A language, literature, education, etc. So, I accept the fruits of Zionism, in other words the Hebraic State with Hebrew as its official language... One of the reasons why I'm not politically in favour of a bi-national state and I'm against the right for the Palestinians to return is because of a direct link to the fear of becoming a minority overnight. But before that, I must insist on the fact that Israeli Jews are a minority in the Middle East, and they will remain so. You just need to look at a map to see where we are. We aren't in Italy, or in France, or in Spain. We are in the Arab world. And whatever happens, in war or in peace, we shall remain a minority. But in Israel, the occupied territories aside, we Israeli Jews are a majority. In the same way as I accept the idea and the principle of a State of Israel within the borders of 67, one of the reasons I'm against a State up to the Jordanian border is that I can't propose the Israeli Jews become a minority overnight. I believe that the demographic power struggle of a bi-national state will present an immediate threat to the Jewish-Israeli identity. Is that clear? But I am for two States. Confederated but two States, with the two populations agreeing. Now, we must make the Israelis understand that the borders of 67 offer a greater guarantee, historically and politically, for the Israelis to keep their own Hebraic culture, because I don't believe it's really Jewish, in the longer term. In September there may be the proclamation, or self-proclamation, of a Palestinian State. - It isn't yet done. They need to have the authorisation of the United States which will certainly veto it since Barack Obama has said if the terrorism and the fighting doesn't stop, he won't authorise it. - There is terrorism now? - It's continuing. It never stops. Just recently, two or three weeks ago, we had an alert in Ashdod. If by some extraordinary turn of events a Palestinian State is created in the following year there will be a war. In the following year... Because they are incapable of respecting a ceasefire or an unwritten peace, but... - What is that due to? - The hatred of the Jew. Hatred for the Jew. The hatred for the Israeli. But essentially the hatred of the Jew. In Israel as everywhere in the world it's the hatred of the Jew. You know, ancient and modern history have proved that the Palestinians only understand the language of force. We can't discuss or have relations with people who seek your destruction. They have always said and continue to do so unashamedly. Hamas say it clearly, and Fatah have joined forces with Hamas today. So if those who govern us aren't able to understand that it will mean war, or we'll leave. And since we don't intend to leave, it will be war. Therefore we must... We are here because it's our country. The Palestinians weren't here a century and a half ago. - And we've been here... - You said a century and a half? A century ago, or half a century ago, they weren't here. There were no Palestinians. It's a people... Not even a people, they are tribes who settled, taking advantage of the fact that the place was empty. - There were no inhabitants? Nablus is a recent town? - No, Nablus was there... but it was rather recent, yes. Adaptation Paul Belle Subtitles LIZARD C.S.E.
