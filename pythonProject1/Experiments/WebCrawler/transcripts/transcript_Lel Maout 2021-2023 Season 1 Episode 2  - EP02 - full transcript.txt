Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- It's time to sleep, girls! Come and sleep. EPISODE 2 Dibo, this is not acceptable. People are supposed to be there for each other. If we don't stand by each other, who will stand for us? If we don't feel for each other, who will feel for us? It's Abou Mahmoud, Dibo. Believe me, Abdallah, this is not up to me. I only receive orders, and I execute what the boss tells me. "Install a cable," I do it. "Pull out a cable," I do it. Do you want me to pay the subscription using my own money? That's okay, I will take care of it. They haven't paid for seven months. That's true, I have studied accounting. I handed in my CV one week ago. No, a girl answered and she said that I'd get a reply from you. -Mahmoud. -One moment. Yes, Dad? Excuse me, I'll call you back, sir. So kind of you, bye. What's the problem, Dad? Is there a problem with the tank? No, no, the tank is okay, but check the television for me. I don't know why the image just went off. So, check it for me. -I'll check it. -Bring a fork or anything metal. Anything. I'll bring a fork. Coming. What's wrong? May God punish them for what they are doing to the people. Coming. It's either the electricity or the cable. -I could hear your voice standing here. -Welcome, Hanane, come in. Listen, I've prepared mujadara and I brought you some. I'm really ashamed because I'm sending these plates back empty. Come in and have some coffee. Neighbors are supposed to be there for each other, so never say that again. Abu Mahmoud, enjoy eating it. -Thank you very much, Hanane. -Thank you very much. -Not at all. -Come on in. I have a few things to finish at home. I'll be back later. See you. -God be with you. -Why did it go off? I'll check it right away, Dad. -How sad these days are! -I'll check it and I'm sure I'll fix it. How bad it is to be poor! Hanane got us a portion of mujadara, so taste it! Mum, where is the metal pole I told you to keep? Which metal pole? I told you to put it away in case we need it. Come with me, come. I don't understand. What metal pole? The one I told you to keep in the drawer in case we might need it. What are you talking about? -Mum? -What? Did you pay for the cable this month? No, dear, I paid the generator bill and I had no money left. Did the son of a bitch cut the subscription? I don't know. Maybe. And even if he did, that doesn't make him the son of a bitch. That's ultimately his right. Bring a skewer and come. -Go check on him. -I'm coming, Dad. Oh, God! Have mercy on us! Hello, Bahij. Listen to me carefully, dear. Abu Mahmoud is in a critical condition and you know that. This guy is obsessed with the news. He is obsessed with the news. No. Should I believe that the channels you are providing are all official? Bahij, we did that together. Listen to me without interrupting. I have a suggestion. Forget about the bills he didn't pay, and from now on, I'll pay. But I don't want him or anyone else in the neighborhood to know. Let's work together. Do we all have to starve? -Good morning. -How are you? Come over when you can. Now you're talking, Bahij. Perfect. Dibo, put the cable back. Right away, Mr. Abdallah. -Good morning, Mr. Abdallah. -Good morning to you. -May God give you strength. -Thank you. I prepared some mujadara today and I brought Rasheed a platter, and I thought about you. I hope you like it. God bless those hands. Enjoy it. Where have you been, Hanane, not checking on the neighbors? I'll come over as soon as I have time. May God protect you, please buy a flower. May God protect these beautiful green eyes, buy a flower. May God protect your husband and children, buy a flower. Okay, don't buy, but take out a 5,000 note. I am hungry, I need to eat! Here. Wow! 50,000! Take a flower! Mr. Karam, give me one corn on the cob and give some to the girls. Hello? Hello? I missed you. I've been missing you for a long time. I can't stop thinking about you, I just can't. I am thinking too. Yes, do think, keep on thinking, don't you ever stop. Hello, Omar. Where are you, man? You've got me worried. You didn't call back or anything. What is keeping you? Are you okay? I am fine. Don't worry about me. How can you tell me that, man? Listen to your voice. When I dropped you off at the airport, you were not fine at all. You didn't say a word in the car. I'm telling you, I am fine. What's wrong with you? Listen to me carefully. Take some advice from an old friend. The best thing you can do is to go out, party, and do whatever you want. Don't you tell me there aren't any beautiful women there. Fine, Omar. We'll talk later. I'm busy right now. Even the one with a kind woman usually betrays her. So, how about you, who has a mean woman? Yes, I have many meetings indeed. I'll call you once I'm done. Bye. Don't tell me that you're not following me this time as well. It is so obvious. Honestly, I am going to have breakfast. You see. Me too. By the way, the food is delicious. Since your staring is confusing me, you may eat. I'm sorry, I was daydreaming and thinking about something. It's obvious and it doesn't need any thinking. What is obvious? What are your plans for dinner tonight? Nothing at the moment, and you? I am invited to dinner. Good. With an extraordinary man. That's nice. And that man is you. So I am that extraordinary man? You are extraordinary to me at least. At 9:00? No, I'd prefer 9:05. Why is that? I will have time to be a little snobbish. Women's behavior, you know. Do you know that you are cute? -I know. -And smart. I know that too. Do you know that you are pretty? If you say so, but your eyes are prettier. So what if I took her phone, what's the big deal? Is it worth all this anger? I'm sure there is something in there, I can even bet on it. But what is she hiding in there? I'd die to know. What else other than betrayal? You really are an idiot. Is that all you've got to say? My God! Look at her shooting! Do you think Mr. Hadi taught her his hobby? I've never seen her shoot, and I've never seen him teaching her. If you've never seen her shoot, and you've never seen him teaching her, that means there is something fishy going on. My God! Check how she is shooting, one bottle after the other. She is really an expert. All these products are expired, so take them back from where you got them. Forgive us, Mr. Abdallah, tomorrow you'll get the best products. Okay then, have a safe journey. -Hello, Uncle. -Hello, I just remembered... Your mother ordered some products, take them from inside. My mother ordered some products? Yes, Rasheed will give them to you, you'll find him inside. He's up in the attic. Uncle, did Rasheed tell you about us? Stop it and go in! Go! -Are you insane? -Lamees? You told Uncle Abdallah about us? What if he goes telling? It's Uncle Abdallah, what's wrong with you? He won't tell anyone. If anything, he'll help us. -Leave me alone. -Lamees, I missed you. -Me too. -Where have you been all day? I was cleaning my aunt's house. -Go now, Sariah. -Aren't you coming? -No, I have a client to drop off. -A client? Give her my regards. I will. Listen, there is perfume in the glove compartment. Put some on to smell nice for this client. Don't worry, I'll do that. Welcome, Sariah, welcome. Why are you shouting like that, Abdallah? I'm not shouting. I'm only saying, "Welcome, Sariah." My mother is here. Go down, go down. If she sees me, she'll kill me. Don't worry, calm down. No way, it seems old age is affecting your hearing. -Yes. -Move away, I need two tuna cans. I don't have tuna. -Then sardines. -Sardines as well. -She shouldn't see us. -I'll pay for that. We are closed for now. Just say that you don't want to sell me anything. Listen, Abdallah, this small store behind you, I won't step in it again, and Abu Mustafa will become rich, thanks to me, and the loans in the ledger, I won't pay them. The police station is right there. Go and file a complaint. I know it, right around the corner. She left. -Yes, she did. -And I have to leave, bye. Bye. Hello? Reem, I have a question, and I wish you'd answer it honestly. What question? Do you love me? Reem, if you still love me, go ahead and say it. I need to hear it right now. Hadi, I've told you I need to be alone to think for a few days, and you're not letting me think. Reem, do you still love me or not? Answer me. No. No, I won't give you an answer right now. We'll talk when you get back. -Thank you. -You're welcome. I've never done anything like that to anyone, but there's always a first time. I know you like whiskey, but since we are celebrating, champagne is much better. Champagne is good too, but may I know what the occasion is? All the coincidences that put us together. But you don't believe in coincidence. -But I believe in fate. -That is really great. In fact, I was supposed to be the one inviting you, but then it turned out that you're inviting me. This is a very nice place. I've already told you that I've never invited anyone, but there is always a first time. You are right. Your dress is very nice. Only the dress? Don't forget, you have to look me in the eyes. Hi, pour me a glass. So, Sousou, are these nice men giving you a hard time? -Not at all, they are so sweet. -That is evident. No, stay with them and take care of them. I'll open. As you wish. Take good care of her. She is my sweet doll. Pour me another one. Welcome! Welcome, prince. You are very welcome, come on in. How are you, Yvonne? I just got better. You promised and you kept your word. Come on in. Welcome. This way, please. Yes. You arrived right on time. This way. Anyway, tell me... Please, have a seat, come on. -Poker or something... -Yeah, something. You're naughty. I want Fifi. Fifi is with a client right now. You know what? Play two rounds of poker until she's finished. Finished? Where do I sit? Wherever you want. Choose the table you like. Take good care of him. Put a chair here, hurry up. Go to Fifi's room right away and ask her not to come out before an hour is up. Quickly. Is it possible that a woman has never fallen in love before? I don't believe it. Yes, that's me. Not even in your childhood? You didn't love the neighbor's son? There's no girl in the world who didn't fall in love with the neighbor's son. This neighbor's son in particular, I didn't like him at all. Even though he tried a lot, he failed. In fact, he and others have failed. Why are you shutting your heart off? Because I don't like being weak. Love is strength, not weakness. When you give your love and trust to someone, then you are giving them a chance to break you whenever they want. But if you don't break, how are you going to learn? -From others' experiences. -Can you do that? Till yesterday, I was able to, but since I've met you, I feel as if something has changed. As if something is happening to me for the first time. With you, I feel that... I think I've had too much to drink. I don't know what I'm saying anymore. Not at all. Maybe you're saying what's in your heart. That's exactly the problem. Usually, there's nothing in my heart to reveal... but I feel as if many things are going to happen for the first time. I am sick when you go away When my mother used to go out at night And left me alone with my despair I'm sick, completely sick What's her problem? Yes, Mona? How do you do, Mrs. Reem? Are you coming back home? I've prepared a delicious dinner. No, I don't want to have dinner. Believe me, ma'am, I've prepared a delicious meal with stuffed vegetables. If you come and eat... Why don't you eat them and leave me alone? I've told you many times not to call me when I leave home. -Okay, ma'am, I apologize. -Apology accepted. I'm addicted to you I'm tired, really tired Please smile a bit, man, you're overreacting. Everybody is depressed in this country. What did she do to you, this whore? Who are you talking about? The one and only, who is controlling your thoughts. The owner of this ring... -Pour me another glass, go. -Whatever pleases you. No more sleeping after today Unless by your side, Amourra I want to go crazy, oh, yeah Oh, yeah Can I ask you a question? Sure. Why me? She made you doubt yourself that much? Hadi, a lot of girls would love to be with you. A lot of girls would love you to look at them. And I'm one of those girls. Basil, what are you doing here? What are you doing? -What am I doing with whom? -With me. THE LATE YOUNG WOMAN NOUR MOHAMMAD DABBOUS -Good morning. -Good morning. You know, whatever happened between us yesterday is the most wonderful thing I've ever experienced. What's wrong? Do you regret it? Thinking about what my life has become, and my relationship with my wife. I feel that whatever happened between us yesterday is fine, normal, but believe me, that is not my nature. That isn't my nature either, but this is the first time in my life that I'm following what I feel. Sahar, I want to tell you something. I'm a married man, so I can't make any promises. I didn't ask you for any promises, but at least don't make me feel that whatever happened was a mistake... and even if you regret it, I will not... because for me, it was not a mistake. Don't make me feel like I am cheap. -Hello, ma'am. -What's the problem with you? Have many times do I have to tell you that when you knock on this damn door, you have to wait for my permission to enter? I apologize. What's that supposed to mean? You apologize and then you do it again. It won't happen again. Breakfast is ready and Mr. Basil is waiting. Good morning, you're late. I was waiting so we could have breakfast together. No, I won't eat, I have an upset stomach. -You go ahead, I'll eat something later. -May you get well soon. Did you call Hadi today? Yes. Many times, in fact. But he has meetings for sure, so no reply. Since when do you smoke? A new habit. You couldn't even bear the smell of cigarettes, so what changed? A person changes with time. Enjoy your breakfast. -Who is it? -It's Rasheed. Open. The most beautiful bouquet for the prettiest Lamees. Come in quick or someone might see you. A great request. Hold on, where are you going? I like the smell of parsley, my favorite flower. You're an expert in these things now. When we get married, we won't starve to death. Married? That's what you say every time. I'm serious every time. Check out what else I've brought. -What's that? -Some cans for dinner. Great, we have moved from vegetables to tuna and cans of sardines. Yes, but these are not yours, they are for my sweet mother-in-law. Mr. Abdallah sent them for her so that she forgives him for what happened yesterday. Go now, before your sweet mother-in-law arrives. Stop it, just go. What's wrong, Reem? What's going on? -Nothing, just fatigue. -Really? It's Hadi calling. Guess where I am. According to your phone number, you're in Lebanon. At your place, to be exact. Nice, when did you arrive? I arrived last night. I wanted to surprise you, but you surprised me, since you're abroad. Reem didn't let me go to a hotel, so I slept at your place. She is right, my place is like your own. You can come whenever you like. Even if I am not there. Anyways, I'll be back in a few days. Yes, Reem told me. Are you okay? Yes, everything is fine. How about you? Is everything okay? Nothing important. Reem and I are in the garden. Would you like to talk to her? No, no, we'll talk later, as I have a meeting and I have to leave. Okay, call me when you are free. Take care. Bye. What's going on, Reem? You gestured that you don't want to talk to him, and he says he is busy. Did you guys have a fight? Sort of. What's the reason? Reem, tell me what happened. I can tell you what will happen. Your brother and I are going to get a divorce. Can we talk now? There's nothing to talk about. On the contrary. Reem you got married out of love, you have been married for less than two months. You can't leave each other when you face your first problem. You have to find a solution and fix the problem. Things are more serious and can't be fixed. Reem. As long as there is love, everything can be fixed, believe me. You forgot this in my room. Don't you want it? Okay, what do you want me to do so that you forgive me? I want you. I'd like to know everything about you. Everything? From your childhood till now. There's no time to tell you all that. I have time. I'm not busy at all. I have a meeting in an hour. Can't you postpone it? I feel like spending the day together. I feel like going crazy. More than we already are? Much more. You know, Hadi? I feel as if I'm in a dream. I don't want to wake up from this dream. But I know that one day, maybe I'll wake up from it. Today you are with me, but maybe tomorrow, you're not. Sahar, I don't want to think about tomorrow. Right now, I'm happy and relaxed, so I don't want to think about anything else. I think I've started to love you. Maybe it's a little too soon. -Thank you. -You're welcome. You know that you are cute, pretty, and smart. Isn't it better than being annoying, boring, and moody? How much time do you need to get ready? It depends. Ready for what? To go party and act crazy till morning. I would need 24 minutes to be at your door. -Is that too much? -Yes. -I'll give you a discount. -How much? -Twenty-three minutes. Is that okay? -It's perfect. Where do you want to take me? -Where do you want to go? -Wherever you want. -As long as we are together. -We will be together. Don't be late. Hadi? Are you sure you don't want me to come into your room to get crazy with you?
