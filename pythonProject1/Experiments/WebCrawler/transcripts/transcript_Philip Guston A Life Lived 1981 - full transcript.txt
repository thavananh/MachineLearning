foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- - [Philip] One always quarrels with what one is. I'm a modern painter, I suppose. My quarrel with modern painting is that I feel that much of modern painting, in fact, perhaps some of my early work too, that it was too easy to illicit a response, you know. Painters could put down some swatches of color, and everybody responds, I mean needs so much sympathy. It has such a sympathetic audience. I think I wanted more and more specificity in the work. There's too much of a love affair in modern art, you know. - I have a personal question which I don't expect you to answer, but I am fascinated wondering what happened between 1962 and 1969, particularly in 1964, '65. - Same thing that happened in 1930. What do you mean, to my painting? - [Interviewer] Yeah. - I think when I paint this, or that, or that, I'm still in 1940 or '50, or in the '50s, yeah. I mean I don't know what I'm going to do. I mean, many of these pictures have many pictures underneath that have been scraped out, as the older ones do. The appearance may change. That's why the comments about style sound strange to me. You work in this style or in that style as if you had a choice in the matter. What you're doing is trying to stay alive and continue and not die. Therefore, it's circular, you're still back there. I don't feel any differently now than I did in the early '50s when I was doing so-called non-figurative things. I know that they're dissolved and they don't have this figuration and all that, but that's really beside the point. Because what is to the point is the... that I'm in the same state. - But altered slightly. - But? Yeah, but that's not my business. - [Interviewer] Manifestations too. - The rest is not my business. All I want to do stay that state, the rest is not my business. - Well actually I've known Philip's work for a long time. Back when I was a student at the Art Institute of Chicago in the 1940's I first saw paintings by Philip Guston in the old Chicago annuals and the American shows at that time. That was before abstract expressionism, just after World War II. And so I was aware of Guston, I wasn't aware of his history or where he came from or anything else but simply by looking at paintings like Martial Memory I felt that's exactly the way I wanted to work, because it was the advanced painting of the time. And then I was called into the service. And when I was gone from 1952 to 1954, it was during that period of time that museums began to pay a great deal of attention to the new abstract painters, to Pollock, to Kline, to Guston, the whole bunch of 'em. So when I came back to school for my masters degree, what had been the old Guston was gone and what was the new Guston was there. But his particular kind of abstract expressionism, or abstract impressionism, whatever you want to call it, the colors were so attractive, the whole thing related in some vague way to the late Monet, and you could feel an historical attachment. I then, I would say in fairness, I lost track again, as everyone did. We got involved with the Jasper Johnses and the Robert Rauschenbergs and the Frank Stellas and a few other of the early '60s artist. But I wondered always what he was doing. And when the Marlborough show happen in 1970, I think it was a shocker for all of us in a way. Not so much a shocker for me because I knew, consciously knew, his work of the 1930s and the 1940s where not dissimilar things appeared. The young boys in cardboard hats and newspaper hats and fighting with wooden swords weren't too far away from the kind of rendering of the new Ku Klux Klan painting. The whole sense of them is so tough and so strong at a time when painting generally appeared to have the signs at least that it was getting burned out one way or another. To see one of the old-timers come back with this kind of vigor at that point in his life was irresistible. Though I admit that at that time I did not know that back in the 1930s he had been dealing with the Ku Klux Klan in quite a different way than at the Marlborough show. I will admittedly say that as the painting went on to the '70s, the shock of the early Marlborough paintings was nothing compared to what happened after that. - They really are. (laughing) - Go ahead, Philip. - Remy was saying that and I didn't believe it was so. Good to see you. - Good to see you. You look great. (mumbling) Put on a little weight. - That was the food on the plane. - Yeah, bologna. (laughs) Isn't that nice? - I haven't seen this in 25. - [Henry] I know, so did I, isn't that funny? Memory does wonderful things. - Well it hadn't been mounted. This is the one show I can touch pictures and nobody's gonna tell me nothing. - But when you painted that picture that was a very big picture when you painted it. - Yeah. Gee, had that always been mounted? - [Henry] They're in pretty good shape. They're in pretty good shape, yeah. They got the frame on the Mother and Child. - Yeah, the Mother and Child. I was 17 years old. I was studying the Renaissance painting, as well as De Chirico and the Picasso of the '20s. Well, you have to come from somewhere. You don't come out of the sky. Holy Moses! - You ready? - Jesus! - For the power base. - Oh, here's the knockout. - You're exactly right. Like two different shows, Philip. - [Philip] Yeah, this is a knockout. - [Henry] Like two different shows. - [Philip] It's overwhelming, Henry. - [Henry] Yes, it is overwhelming. - I don't know how much more I can take of it. Marvelous. Are you happy? - [Henry] Oh, I'm very happy. - [Philip] How's Jan? - [Henry] She's in great shape. She's in great shape. - What's been on my mind, you ask, this last decade say, but primarily the last five, six years is the... for me, the cruciality of a contest, (stammering) to me, every painter or artist has his own temperament, of course, and my temperament seems to need or I'm not happy, not happy, not involved, unless I have... I call it a contest. Contest between a subject and the plastic form it will result in. And the reason I enjoy the contest is that this contest between the means of painting, I mean scale, distances, locations, spaces. - Surfaces. - Surfaces, color, that's right, thin or thick and so on. Leads, since I constantly change on a single painting, I mean scrape out and repaint a lot as you know, leads to structures which are surprising. I was born in Montreal, Canada. At a very early age family moved to Los Angeles, California where I was reared until about the age of 18 when I left for New York. The earliest contact with an art school was about I think the age of, perhaps 16 or 17. An art school in California where I'd won a scholarship, but I couldn't afford to stay in art school. (stapler smacking) I had to work for a living. I worked at odd jobs at the time. I'd drove trucks, I worked in a cleaning plant, doing all sorts of things, and painted at night and weekends. I started drawing and painting when I was about 11 or 12. Well in the west coast, I mean in Los Angeles, there was very little by way of any excitement in art. There were, they used to call it, I think the Eucalyptus School of Painting, landscape painters and so on. It's not at all what it is today. However, there was one source of inspiration. There was a doctor Walter Aaronsberg, who had perhaps the only collection of modern art there, and it was a very good collection. It was a collection that he commissioned Marcel Duchamp to collect for him. It was the first time I had seen Picassos and Mir?s, Brancusi, Klee, the whole school of Paris modern movement was available to me for the first time. I was mostly struck by De Chirico. They hit me very hard, in fact, it was seeing these paintings by De Chirico, it's what made me to want to be a painter, not resolve. I thought as if I had come home. A high school friend was Jackson Pollock and my memory is of going with Jack, he was Jack then, to old secondhand book shops and fighting each other to buy old Dial magazines. There was like you'd find, I suppose in any province, a small group, sort of an underground group of young painters and politically interested people and poets and writers and musicians. This was a small rebellious group, which we were interested in all the advanced forms of poetry and painting then which would come to us by way of magazines and reproductions, never an original exhibition. And we decided to do a group of frescoes on the Scottsboro case, which was a hot case at that time. You remember the Scottsboro? Nine black boys who were sentenced for life for raping a white girl. And it was all circumstantial evidence. So we did a series of frescoes on the Scottsboro case, which was shown at the John Reed Club which was in North Hollywood at that time. The KKK, which was very strong in LA at that time had an immense membership. And they just with lead pipes and guns shot through the eyes of the black guy being whipped by a clansmen. I just thought I'd give you the way it was then in LA. About 1935 or '36 I went to New York. I came to New York and I saw those brick walls. I felt as if I had come home. I remember going to the first artist union meeting with 2,500 painters and sculptures. I thought, this was incredible. Pollock and his brother had gone to New York the year before. So I when I first arrived in New York I lived with them in their loft on eighth street. And then gone on the federal art projects in New York, on the mural part of it. It was, to follow up from the Aaronsberg collection, it was the first time I was exposed to galleries and the museums in New York. My painting kept changing, constantly being influenced by what I was seeing. In one of the last murals I had painted, a part of this mural which was a section which depicted some children, young children fighting on the street with ashcans and various pieces of lumber and sticks and so on, and some reason or another this struck a chord in me. For the next six years or so I painted a number of easel paintings of this subject, of children. I remember destroying the whole group of pictures in the latter part of this period because they didn't ring true to me, and it was a sure sign to me that I wasn't involved with it, and I was using the subject as an excuse to make pictures, and nothing is more boring in the world than to make pictures. What you want is an experience of making something that you haven't seen before in that way. I was studying Piero, obviously, but when I reached the bottom in working with this, I had a year in which I kept destroying paintings. I've told this to Henry. Because I didn't want to paint the subject. Actually I was getting through with this subject. - [Henry] Yeah, right. - When I reached down here, and I started to paint, and suddenly I didn't feel it, it wasn't real to me, like If This Be Not I or Martial Memory. So then I realized, well, relationships have a different meaning and that's why... - [Henry] Look at that and this. - And that came next, but it was a year later. And that's what happened. I felt good about this. It felt, well not that it was abstract, but that it was moving to a place I didn't know where I was going and that's what I enjoy, of not knowing where you're moving. 'Cause that's full of potential, of course. But you know those are still the hooded figures. So when I reached this point, I went to Europe for the first time. I was on a c.r.e.t.a. Rome. I faked it. I got a c.r.e.t.a. Rome by submitting these pictures. I just wanted to wander the streets alone think about painting. I knew I was headed for a change, I didn't know where or what. I didn't just stay in in Rome, that's when I traveled all over and saw my pantheon of painters for the first time in the flesh, I mean Piero, Masaccio, De Sanctis. I drew out of the hotel rooms and I did a lot of drawings like that. And then I came back in '49 and began painting as if I were just beginning to paint. From '49 for me up until say '55 was this very intense active period in New York of what's called the New York school. Which I much prefer and I think many of my contemporaries prefer that term to the term abstract expressionist because it simply defines a place and a certain period where a number of artists, for many reasons, were together at one time. De Kooning, I knew on the WPA projects, on the federal art projects. Rothko and Motherwell, I'd met at that time. Barney Newman, we all electrified each other. I know what I ate that day, you know the lunch I ate, when the picture finally came off. - [Woman] Is that true? - Sure, and I can remember stories. When this picture came off in the old Cedar Bar days, about three in the morning, I was on 10th Street, you know the artists' plot. - [Woman] Yes. - I go into Cedar bar and Bill Kooning's at the bar with Franz Kline. I'd been on it for, I don't know, two or three weeks and finally came off. All the surround are just, they're erasures of other forms. I had this look on my face, and Bill says, looks at me, he said, "Good strokes, son. "You made some good strokes." (laughing) So, I mean, I remember all these little intimate details about each picture. It seems like every five or six years or something like that I begin feeling that I've exhausted something and gradually move into another thing. Dissatisfaction entered in to the work you've done for the past five years. Not that problems have to be solved, because nothing is ever solved in painting. It's a continuous chain that sometimes doesn't go in one line but goes in a serpentine line or in the crooked paths, detours, which have to be investigated. I felt like an explorer who almost got to the top of Mount Everest and somehow stopped just short and remembered, and thought 'Well, perhaps, maybe I forgot some gear'. 'I forgot some equipment'. But in going down to recover this equipment I took some side paths that looked exciting and full of possibilities. What equipment did I lack? It was a stronger contact with the thickness of things. I suppose I was reacting against being too imaginative and wanted everything to come from things. The graining of wood, the feeling of stone, the corruption of the world, the violence in the world. Nothing new at all. I wanted it to be more like the art of the past that I liked. I mean a Mantegna painting doesn't care if 500 spectators fall off a cliff, you know it's there. And so it goes. In my loft, when I lived in New York, and had this hundred foot grimy loft full of crap and junk and so on, over a firehouse, in Chelsea. I hadn't painted for about two months. Didn't feel like it. My painting was beginning to bore me, I mean what I'd been doing. I stretched up a 10 foot canvas, not on a stretcher, I painted on the wall, on the partition wall. And squeezed out tons of paint. Oh, I'll paint the room. I'll paint all this junk. I had an eight hour stint. I painted the cracked and broken mirror and the paint table with paint on the floor scraped out, you know the oil, dirty, you know, a New York loft. Useless wires hanging down. And other easels and stacked up drawing. I painted like my eye, I looked, I didn't think at all. I painted the whole thing. In fact I ended up about eight, nine hours. I look back and I thought, well, Jesus, I'm a painter. It looked like a Bonnard or, you know... it was really wonderful, a lot of colors and everything. I was doing these black pictures then, the beginnings of these dark, heavy, black pictures. We lived across the street and I woke up Musa about four in morning, I said, you gotta look at this. And of course she came over and she said, "Gee, it's wonderful". Then I couldn't sleep 'cause I thought what's happening? Am I going to have a new career as a painter? Is my painting changing? Does this deny all my previous work? You know? To make the story short, when I came in the next morning to look at it, my euphoria was gone, just disappeared. The painting itself looked as if I could just peel it off. Didn't stick. And naturally, I destroyed it. This desire for more solid forms continued all into the early '60s with these more or less ambiguous images but they were very solid, these black pictures. And more and more desire grew to make them even more objective and even recognizable. After I had the exhibition of this work in '66, I started drawing a lot. Such as the books on the table or the clock hanging on the wall, or my shoe on the floor. It felt free somehow to make it a recognizable object painted as if I was seeing the object for the first time. Unconsciously as I look back on my old work, on this early work now, it's as if I was preparing the scenario, so to speak, unconsciously, I didn't know what I was doing. But these fragmentary pictures were all later incorporated into the large work. For instance, these are very early drawings of books that I did years ago. Which I wanted to get the thickness and solidity of the. These led into, as you can see in the back here, some paintings of books, some small paintings of books. They kept changing their forms as I worked into them. They became stone tablets. Something like this became like some ancient manuscript or something like that. This is a recent one, which I wanted to give the feeling of an old, crumpled, book that had been in existence for thousands of years. Then I began drawing, this is a very early drawing. I began drawing a subject which I dealt with many years ago of the hooded figures. They're obviously... based on Ku Klux Klan figures. But I didn't mean to make a story about the Ku Klux Klan. I'm just using them as a, I suppose you'd call it a symbol, of hooded, masked figures. - [Interviewer] I guess the violence of those years. - Oh, yes. Oh, indeed. You mean politically speaking here? Very definitely had a big influence on me. - [Interviewer] What in particular? - Everything. The war, the political conventions, the state of the world, everything. I don't think it's limited just to America, either, I mean the violence in the world ever since I've been alive. Which everyone experiences that. I moved away from New York in '67. Upstate, about 100 miles upstate. My productivity increased. In New York you gotta go to openings, the social life, it's too much. You know time I've learnt, is not actual time for an artist, it's continuity of time. So if I can have months of just nothing pulling on me, nothing ahead or anything, it's wonderful time because you continue from you paint all night, and then sleep, then you can paint. You know what I mean, you continue. In New York I couldn't. I was on a crest of the wave when that finally broke about '68. My old interests came surging back. I felt like Fellini. I felt like a movie director. I had to make memos to myself. Have 'em around a table playing poker, have 'em drinking beer, eating hamburgers, you know some are riding cars. I was attacked, you know, that goes with it. I'm used to it. Like at the opening of the Marlborough show when I did those hoods there, I mean the painters would come up to me, I remember I don't have to name them, and they'd say, "Phil, what did you have "to go and do that for?" Well you have no idea how opinionated people are or. Oh, the fine hatchet jobs were done on me. It bothered me the, you know, what's happened to this painter? He was such a nice painter. I mean John Cage said you were living such a beautiful country. He hated the new work, Cage did, together with other people. I mean some painters that I'd known for years wouldn't even talk to me, like I had entered into a covenant in a church, and I was being excommunicated. Bill Kooning put it a better way. He said, "What do they think, we're all on a baseball team?" (laughing) Bill said what's all this nattering about figuration and politics. He says it's about freedom! So you know, embraced, kissed each other, and said of course, the first thing an artist, his only possession is freedom finally. That sounds easy, doesn't it? But it's rough. (scraping) You know that story about someone who knew a child and had seen the child when he's an adult. Says, my, how you've changed. The child doesn't feel he's changed in that 20 years or 15 years. He's the subject. I am the subject. The first thing always looks good and then you start doubting it, you know. Very nice. Fronts. Here, this arched one is nice. I used to draw these and paint them years ago. I used to put them in paintings, as a background I'd put in those windows. I love old brick buildings anyway, particularly the river, Hudson River buildings. Well it hasn't changed at all since the turn of the century. I just like the looks of it. Actually I also like the fact it's old and that it's uninhabited. I've done drawings of this. Something about the fact that it's not used anymore fascinates me, in other words, it's original intention has vanished so that it exists now as a kind of object, like a work of art, it has no function whatsoever and that fascinates me. What do you like about the building, Clark? Those metal stars? - Any metal attached to this brick is kinda fascinating. - Yeah, I know. - [Clark] The rust. I like the way things decay. - [Philip] He's a poet. He can say it better than I can. Looks like a jail too. - Yeah, it does. - Oh, no, Philip. - [Philip] No? - [Woman] A jail wouldn't have those nice eyebrows. (laughing) - [Philip] That's what they are. Eyebrows with teeth. - If you look at a lot of these it's almost like a movie in a way. - You mean the sequence? - [Clark] Yeah, the way it is here. I don't know how it would be singly. - One of the hooded figures all like he just dipped his, the jam smeared all over him or something. I like this one. The back of the head like a real, almost half vegetable, half root. Huh? - [Clark] Rock too. - Half rock or root or something like that. I wanted like a really a bunch of dumb creatures. They're really dumb, just dumb creatures. I mean the world we live in, you know? (laughs) The real world. Well somebody was here the other day who had these kinda thoughts, this wasn't as good as. I really wanted to kick him out. I thought, you really don't know... You really don't know how it works. That's just not the way the thing works. - [Clark] You mean he came in here and he looked at all this and he said this isn't as good as? - [Philip] That's right. Or not as good as something I painted last year or. If the artist starts evaluating himself it's an enormous block, isn't it? - [Clark] Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. - [Interviewer] Do you think of yourself as kind of pessimistic in attitude, in terms of say the large subject of your art? I don't know if maybe that's too large to talk about. - I don't think it was pessimistic. Think it's doomed. (laughs) I don't mean I consciously set out to paint doom. - [Interviewer] Is that an aspect of say the modern condition then? - Yes. Yes, I think so. - [Interviewer] 'Cause you feel you've lived it. - I think so. Then quite a number of paintings in the last five, six years are my impulse in doing them were quite frankly, autobiographical. I mean I was quite conscious. Autobiographical in a sense, to be very specific, two or more years ago Musa, my wife, had a minor stroke. She was in the hospital for quite a while. I became obsessed with her situation. She became a kind of symbol, just the top of her head, her hair parting off to the horizon. I'm quite aware that what I'm doing there is using specific, in that case specific subject matter. Look what Henry did. Very nice. He puts a Coats picture. But you can gather them, the two together. Then the Musa, as he calls 'em, pictures. This one, that one, and this one. Musa As Horsehoes. - [Henry] And this one. - And this one. Sure! It was you, then it became a horseshoe, and then it became you again. - [Henry] Then a sun and a wheel and a. - That's right! Was there ever a painter who thought he could make a picture, I'm not being vain, but I mean, I was so amused in painting this. It was gonna be another leg picture. You can tell because I painted out the repeated legs. Then I put a door in and then fanciful bugs parading below. They're stamping bugs there. Well that's a human thing. - Concern. - We always stamp bugs out, right? But it can become a painting. So art can be anything, right? - [Henry] Yeah, that's right, yes. - [Interviewer] You talked earlier of Musa's situation, how did your own recent illness affect your work? - When I came home from the hospital I wanted to paint a man dying because that's what had happened to me, I mean that was my own experience with this heart attack. But I was reading the Four Quartets at the same time. It's a late Eliot work and I like the Four Quartets. I was aware as I was doing it, I didn't want to do a self-portrait, too obvious and it wasn't right for me to do that. I certainly in the middle of it became aware this looked like Eliot, and the reason for the ear, which is extended like a Buddha ear was because I just happened to know that Eliott became very interested in his later years in buddhism. I mean that's the reason for it. - [Interviewer] And this is you at work? - Well. - More or less. - [Philip] The artist, yeah. - [Interviewer] The artist at work. - [Philip] That's right. And the big fat brushes that are. - [Interviewer] His tools in front of. - His tools, that's right pallette. - [Interviewer] And a few piles of paint, right? - [Philip] That's right. This is paint down here. - [Interviewer] And the bugs. - Yeah, it's a discovered picture, I mean it's one of those pictures that are found in the painting for me. I don't know when I do a thing like that I'm aware that it's some kind of bug. I mean the impulses make some kind of insect, but I don't know what kind or. I'm sure there isn't an insect that's formed like that, I don't know. Or I don't even know what that is exactly. I know this is a stone, I meant it to be a stone. Once I moved into here, I just naturally wanted to have some kind of creature looking over. It was fun to paint. Huh? - [Interviewer] You didn't feel compelled to complete the other side of the ravine there? - No. You mean this part? Oh, no, that's open. You gotta have that. It's amazing the more picture painted itself in this case. But the more you're in it, the more that simultaneity occurs. (stammering) I mean I'm very aware that while the brushes are moving this way, and I wanted this to move this way. I mean there's this impulse that's... I don't like the word spontaneous but it is in a way, instincts, that having things move opposite directions and up and down and so on. I mean once the moon was here it would look terrible. It just felt wrong. And then I put it there at the very end, even cut off, felt right. I think once I said something to quote myself many years ago I remember that, I was talking to John Cage actually, I said, when you go in the studio, everybody is in the studio, your friends, and art writers and the museum people, they're all in the studio, you're just there painting. One by one they leave. You see, that's what I told John. One by one they leave until you're really alone. That's what painting is. You wait and you prepare yourself to be when there's nobody there, and then ideally you leave. - [Interviewer] I was just gonna ask you. - Ideally you leave. - [Interviewer] And then somebody stays behind and does the painting. - That's right. A third hand does it, that's right. But it's no different than... I think Stravinsky said that he didn't write Rites of Spring, it wrote itself through him. Well, that's not a "why" statement, it's a realistic concrete statement. In other words you feel as if you're not through until you feel as if you're a medium through which this rhythm is passed through. Otherwise it's unbearable. Otherwise it's wax museum. I was thinking about, not legs, I mean they're just the excuse. Well I was thinking about, actually when it came off, I enjoyed the fact that the top becomes like a top, like a table top, a level. I really enjoyed myself painting this. With the openings, you know where you open it, where you jam it up. I mean you're dealing with forces. And suddenly these are charging and this is dangling like a pendulum, you know. And here it's gathering force like charging out. The idea of, yeah, of a completely separate organism, an organism like you'd find in life, in nature, which has its own energy, energies, diverse energies. I like the fact that it's happening in front of you rather than, I think in that case, it feels as if you had just come in on something that's already happened. It's already happened. But this is in the midst of happening, which excites me. - It's got nothing to do with feet and shoes. - Nothing. Nothing at all. Am I glad you said that. I've been hearing enough about it from people who talk about feet and legs and shoes and, ugh! - What the painting is all about, it seems to me is right here. Don't you say? - You're very savvy. That's what Meyer Schapiro, who's a close friend, you know the artist? When he saw this picture he said, Philip... I said absolutely, Meyer. Those little openings. Otherwise, you couldn't breathe. It would be unbearable. When you said that's it, you bet. When I started this painting a few days ago, it went alright, it was almost finished in a day. But I came in later that night and, well, I liked the left part, didn't like the right part. So I started changing the right part. Something happened which felt better to me than the left part. So then I changed the left part and before I knew it, the whole painting vanished. The painting that was almost finished here didn't look bad, it looked alright. But it looked almost too good. It's as if I hadn't experienced anything with it. It was too much of a painting. I hadn't experienced enough on it. I don't mean that I need to struggle always with it. I don't mean that exactly. But it looked too pat, if you know what I mean. It looked too much like it felt to me as if it were additions, this and that and that and that. Whereas what I'm always seeking is some great simplicity where the whole thing is just there and can't be this and that and that and that. There's something deathlike about a painting finished. A kind of death happens and... I then am inclined to destroy it. Destruction of paintings is very interesting to me and almost crucial. Sometimes I find that what I've destroyed five years ago I'll paint now as if when the thing first appears you're not ready to accept it either. There's some mysterious process at work here which I don't even want to understand. I know that if I stop painting and became a psychologist of the process of making, I would probably understand it more, but it wouldn't do me any good. I don't want to understand it like that, analytically. But I know that there's some working out that takes place in time, but it's not given to me to completely understand it. It's illegal. One could argue that a picture where you pause and say well that's my conviction at this time is a compromise, 'cause then you go on to future pauses. That's when you stop. That's when a pictures finished. So in other words, all your work is one picture. But then it has to do with continuity, I mean who's life, in other words continuing. Because if you stop, you're wax museum. I mean if you say well that's it, then that's the wax museum idea. So I think it has to do with the gas not running out, or might have to do with fear of death. I don't know. Or you know, wanting to continue. I realize in looking at the show, Musa and I were talking about it at the hotel this morning 'cause we saw it yesterday, that's why I said it's not so much a painting, well it's a painting show, but it's a life. It's like a life lived. I'm curious about what I'm going to do always. I'm just curious. And curious about failures. Curious about non-failures, or less failures. I feel I've opened up a Pandora's box of imagery and structures and so on. I'm still dreaming about pictures that want to paint and going to paint and I do a lot of sketching. It feels endless. - 500 years from now in the history of art, if you could be remembered for just one thing what would you like it to be? - What would I like it to be? - [Interviewer] What do you hope it will be? - You mean as a painter? - [Interviewer] In your work. - I never thought of that but I want to be in the same place that Goya went to. That Manet went to. That Cezanne went to. And I wouldn't mind a pat on the back by them saying, "Not bad, Sonny." That's about all. (laughing) 'Pas mal.' (laughing) The most you can do is try. And I don't think it's courage and all those nice words. In fact one could make a list of all the negative things that would be more true to say about being compelled to continue painting. They would include things like boredom, disgust, all the things you're not supposed to think about. It's not inspiration. Inspiration is like for a minute but. Anger, I mean lots of things that you're not supposed to feel. (laughing) The best thing I can say about summing up. I don't like that word summing up. Summing. Things are constantly opening up for me. All these pictures to me are still open, I mean they might develop. You know, one thing is true which will illustrate perhaps a little more clearly what I'm talking about, is that when you've had to your run in the painting and you feel okay about it, it's both your friend and enemy. By enemy, I mean you want to do it again. I've been more productive these last 10 years than I've ever been in my painting life. I don't feel finished so it's hard for me to sum up except to say that I wish I were painting what I'm painting now being 30 years old. I love painting. I mean painting is my life. Painting is what I live for.
