Transcript for Murder by the Lake (2014–…): Season 1, Episode 5  - Abgrundtief - full transcript
Are you wondering how healthy the food you are eating is? Check it - foodval.com --- The Girl Who Loved To Laugh Ready, thanks. Our show got a big audience. Everyone wants to see a wax corpse. It scares them. What do you mean? An old Lake Constance legend. 'They inhabit the dark deeps for all time.' Never heard of it? Bodies that don't decompose? An old horror fairytale. You mean a physical phenomenon. There were probably weights on the chain. They came loose after ages. T- Ms. Zeiler, hello. - Good morning. - How long was she in the water? - I can't say yet. Time of death of a floater with corpse wax is tricky. But she's been in this condition for years. There's no decay when there's no oxygen. The lake is known for it. The body sinks, ends up in the deep, and... The lake is 750 feet deep, in places. They get waxen at 90 to 120 feet. It didn't have to be that deep. She could be 100 years old. - Definitely not. Extensions, 100 years ago? They could've been made by the water, or the wax, couldn't they? You can still see where they were glued on. I'm sorry, I have to take her away now. She decays too fast in the air. So, take her away, cool her, and keep her airtight. The Lochau Promenade is closed off because of a salvaging. The police say it concerns a dead female. No one has been reported missing the past few days. The body was weighted, so the police don't rule out foul play. We'll keep you informed. - Hausler. - She's back In the red dress. Are you glad? Or does it scare you? She's turned up again. Honey? Is everything all right? Dead body, identity unknown. Team 2 to headquarters. Officers are signing off. Team 4 is on standby. Understood. A wax corpse, female identity unknown. - We're on standby. - I'm on my way. I picked the flamingo because I think the flamingo, Kim, that is... Excuse me. It's not about the job at all. That's Micha's excuse. I have the feeling you don't want to be home. Like you're on the run. - Nonsense. - What are you running away from? Me? Accept Kim's feelings It's about what's important in life. What your priorities are. It's not about saving your marriage. - Excuse me? - Not at any price. Counseling is non-biased. A separation could be the best for everyone. That's what we have to find out, using the flamingo... and the owl. You're divorced, aren't you? - You checked out Mr. Wolters? - Married and divorced twice. Why are you qualified? Yes, I'm coming. Hello, Zeiler. Did you need a vacation? - Counseling. You have no idea. - Was Kim there, too? Good evening. Hello, Egger. How are you? - Five stitches, but I'm all right. - Thank God. Was anything stolen? No, the body's there, her dress too. That's all she wore. - No underwear? - No. The chains are gone, but I took pictures. What do we do now? Am I in danger, or something? - We can't rule it out. - Yes, we can. There's a body and a dress. No shoes or underwear. And two chains are missing. Someone thinks the chains lead to him. He got them, there's no need to worry. We'll investigate this anyway. If you like, you can get protection. That's all right, thanks. So all we have is a photograph of the chains? Yes, unfortunately. But we have something else. The woman has been dead 15, 20 years. She was about 18 or 20 when she died - Cause of death? - I'm working-on it. - I tried to establish her identity first. Which means? There are no fingerprints because of the wax. There's DNA. They didn't register it back then. - But it was worth checking anyway. Why? She had a genetic defect. Trisomy 21. What? The girl had Down's syndrome? Hey, that's beautiful. Hello. Hello, Marie. You're all in red today? Your first water color. It's beautiful. Is that Daddy? That was Marie's favorite dress That was the day she disappeared, right? You didn't report your daughter missing right away. Had it happened before? For how long? Usually during the day. Sometimes until late at night. Where did she go? - For a walk in the woods. You don't know exactly? She loved nature. So your daughter had certain freedoms? That's what I'm sick of. These hidden accusations. I treated her normally, like all parents with adult children. And why not, Mr. Hausler? - Who's accusing you? - Everyone. I got anonymous phone calls. I still do. We can trace them. - A special unit looked for Marie. - Of course. There was a special unit, a search, and a certain mentality. "The mongoloid girl ran away" they said. "She's gone." And that was it. But she didn't run away. She died that day, or shortly after. We'll find out what happened. So many cops have said that over the years. Your brother as well. Where was the video recorded? At Sunchild Villa, a care facility. I still work there. Did you film your daughter? Marie isn't my daughter. Manfred and I got together later. But you knew Marie well, didn't you? Yes. - Your ex-wife, Marie's mother... - She hanged herself. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't go on with this. Did Marie have a new friend? New interests? Did you notice anything? The police questioned us all. Again and again. Concerning a missing person. We're talking about a death now. Probably about murder. Marie was the same as ever. A cheerful, fun-loving child. A young woman already, really. My husband never changed a thing. I wanted to let it go at some point. Like many people have, perhaps. Marie only painted people she liked. She was very sensitive. They're all sensitive. And fun-loving. You know about it? About art? No. The external force wasn't aimed at one point but at the chest and pelvis. It was brutal. The ribs badly injured the lungs and the artery. So, internal bleeding? Lethal? Hard to say after so long. But I think it killed her, and very slowly So she didn't drown? It was on land? - Before she got into the water, yes. I've got something else. - Can you help me turn her over? - Absolutely not. Fine, I'll do it myself. - Here, on the heels. Do you see that? - Yes. Tears in the skin. Yes, but especially the things stuck inside. Those are gravel. From the lake floor? That's just it. The geology around the lake is well-documented. This doesn't fit. Too many salts. The lake doesn't have them. Geology isn't your field. You're going all out. - I was knocked down. - Yes, five stitches. Very motivating. Could you? Good? Certainty also means peace. As terrible as it may sound. Why did your husband's ex-wife kill herself? Many parents of handicapped children feel a failure. They feel guilty. Not everyone understands. - I do. I understand very well, even. Your husband mentioned your brother. Joseph was on the case back then. He never stopped looking for Marie. He was the only one. Thank you: All the best. My regards to your husband. Bye. - Hello. Where can I find Mr. Malters? - Probably down by the jetty. Why are we meeting here? Those pictures you sent me. I've been thinking. The traces on Marie's naked feet. I think the body was pulled away by the shoulders. The marks on the feet are lengthwise, yes. - Probably while moving her. - She had no shoes on. Marie died very slowly. She was brutally injured in the lumbar region and died of internal bleeding. - But how were these injuries made? - That's the question. Why weren't there more leads? Why simply 'missing, ran away'? - That's what we'll discuss with him. With whom? Joseph Malters. An ex-colleague. Go away. - What are you looking for? Get lost. - Police, Mr. Malters. - I was on the force once. So you know how it works. - On the Austrian side, however. - How nice. What are you doing here? These are maps of the currents. - Of the currents? - Yes, to analyze the currents with. It interests me greatly why they found Marie over there. You can track what floats where in detail? Of course. You can get these maps from the Maritime Research Institute. They've existed for decades. Every day, every hour. Using the time, space and depth you can simulate currents on the computer. Fascinating, isn't it? Marie was murdered? Going by the injuries, we assume she was. She died the day she disappeared. That's what you think because she wore the red dress she had on then. But three weeks later, she was still writing letters. Just a few lines. Letters? Yes. Would you like to see them? What's going on? Is this your doing? -No, mine You have no right to be here. Get lost. I am allowed to be here, Mr. Malters. Sabotaging and obstructing an investigation? We'll take the computer too. We found something that belongs to us. A lot of files from the police archives. About the Marie Hausler case? He took them as a souvenir on his last working day. No one cared about Marie's case anymore. Because we officially assumed she ran away. - Where are Marie's letters? The third drawer from the top. You never gave up, did you? - Marie is family. You're collecting evidence? The originals? There weren't any prints, except on the fourth letter, and they were secured. I'm fine. - Is that all? - They were Marie's fingerprints, right? - Why else was the search stopped? - Did an expert examine this? Marie's handicap ruled out recognizable writing. - But it fit in with her other stuff. - She was already dead. I know that by now, thank you. Malters joined the Marie unit right after she disappeared. But when the unit was dissolved, he applied for early retirement. You heard him. He investigated privately. Marie is family. He's lying. We should check if Malters was paid by Hausler. It doesn't add up. Think about it. Malters wasn't even part of the family at the time. Hausler was still married to Marie's mother. - It amounts to the same thing. - Yes, to stealing files. That case has lapsed. He's right. Nobody was interested anymore. - He collected facts, not trophies. - He could've manipulated facts, too. The lack of success of the unit was epoch-making. That's my first impression. Well, then. Try it again. Why does he cling to that old heap? The heap seems to contain his secret, Komlatschek. Marie's laughter. I can still hear it. So can I. I'd only just started out here. Then she disappeared. Terrible. Do the police have new insights? - Can they solve this case? - I hope so. They assume it was foul play, but they won't tell us anything. Poor Marie. I wasn't expecting you to come to work today. I'm actually happy to be here. What would I do at home by myself? Thanks for pushing. The engine's purring again. It was hard to gauge the length of the chains from this underexposed shot. I'm sorry. You make it sound like a complaint. Would a complaint be of any use? I used the length, the strength and number of the links... to calculate the chains' length. The length minus twice the strength... I don't understand, So? - Both chains are exactly five feet. - You can get those at any hardware store. And why two? Why not one long chain to sink her? The chains had probably been used for something else. Probably. Malters' statements match the data in the files Which means? Until the letters they assumed various things. Kidnapping, rape, manslaughter, murder. The unit was in the dark. - Yes, it was all hypothetical. - Except for one initial suspicion. - Suspicion of what? Murder. They didn't pursue it, since it appeared Marie was still alive. Elisabeth Ludwig. Mrs. Ludwig wasn't fond of, and I quote, "That mongo slut of that asshole Hausler" I like her already. Thanks. Mongo slut... Here, this is the woman. - Elisabeth Ludwig? - She was furious at Marie Maybe she still is. Are we ready? - Mrs. Ludwig? Got a reservation? No, we won't stay long, we... That's fine with me. 100 an hour. I have to change the sheets. GCHT, dear. General Conditions for the Hotel Trade, if you like. And then the criminal code. Procuring, if you like. Oh, the cops. I wondered when you'd turn up. Then you know why we're here. All my guests have left. Not even I can sugarcoat a floater in a holiday spot. Even as a corpse, she ruins my business. Marie Hausler? I've got nothing against retards or mongos. But she was bad for business. I didn't want her here. That's not illegal, is it? - A certain empathy is missing. - A lot more than that. They don't call it mongolism anymore. It's Trisomy 21. It's a handicap, not a disease. - Some of them have degrees. Why are you telling me this shit? So you'll stop misbehaving. Or I'll misbehave, and you don't want that. - You're threatening me? You understood, nice. We can go on. Why are you so mad at Marie Hausler? Here. This was one day after the fire. What fire? - Marie burned my place own. - Why was she here? - She always was. She bothered the guests. She was in love with my dog, took him for walks. - That's nice. - I didn't ask her to. These trisomists are crazy about animals. The dog had to watch the house, not provide therapy. She took him to the woods every day. What about the fire? I saw Marie, the smoke, and the fire. The insurance paid, but Daddy Hausler never apologized for his sunshine. You chased her away, and even hit her once. - Rumors. Nonsense. - Files. Complaints. There was no proof. I didn't do it. - The father did it, I tell you. Do you call him anonymously, to tell him? Hausler dumped Marie in the lake. I'm sure. - I think he loved his daughter. - He wasn't mourning. After it happened, he started making a fortune. - That's not illegal. - It's not decent. You should talk. He was glad to be rid of the invalid. He could make more money. His new type of boat was named after her. "Marie." The brochure told the whole sad story. - Yes, he was looking for his daughter. - Sure. He produced a new tub. "The Lost Daughter." The rich jerk-offs went wild for it. Things couldn't have been better. - The child gone, and the wife too. What do you mean? He has no feelings. He was already cheating on her. He doesn't stop at anything. - What about the dog? It disappeared. No one paid for it. This is unheard of. Unbelievable. Man! Hands off. I'm sorry. I'll do it. If you want to talk about it, Ill Thanks. I'm all right. You're an unfaithful soul as well, you lousy mutt. - What do you want? To apologize? - Shouldn’t we talk? - How could you be sure she was alive? - The letters, I... I feel as if I betrayed her, for years. Do you understand, Joseph? I blamed my child for running away, every day of the last 15 years. I did everything in my power. - She didn't abandon me, she was dead. - Want to curse me out some more? - Maybe Corinna would still be alive. - Nonsense. Only the uncertainty killed her. We won't pay you anymore. Not a single euro. As long as that's clear. Do you think I did it for the money, all those years? You're a cold-hearted asshole An enormous asshole. Everyone says so. What would you say? It's not unattractive. Mr. Wohifahrt? - Can we cross this? - Yes, go ahead. Inspector Oberlander. My colleague, Ms. Zeiler. We'd like to talk about a former pupil The body that was found in the harbor? Marie Hausler -Exactly. Do you have a few minutes? Of course. You started working here before she disappeared, didn't you? Yes. But I don't remember much. Talk to my colleague, Jasmin Hausler. It's funny. Everyone tries to brush us off. I'd like to know why. They're not pleasant memories. My working life began with a missing pupil. - I understand. - But still. Manfred Hausler regularly gave you money 100,000 every year. Yes, we mainly depend on donations. Mr. Hausler was the biggest donor. The year Marie disappeared, he didn't transfer it He withdrew the money. Why did he pay in cash that time? He didn't pay at all. You've collected beautiful leaves. Back from your vacation? I'll see you in a minute, all right? Beautiful. We'll press them later, OK? We didn't get a donation. A few days after her disappearance he stopped. And he hadn't re-enrolled her either. He must've changed his mind. - Because Marie had disappeared? - I don't know. I had the feeling Marie was very happy here. She loved the garden, the nearby woods: Any idea what she did there? - Long walks. To her, freedom and nature were the best. She could handle them. She felt at home there. Hausler hadn't re-enrolled Marie. And he stopped the donation, too. But he did withdraw 100,000. What did he do with it? It’s like he already knew she wasn't coming back. Maybe he's leading us on. For 15 years, he's been watching that video. Again and again. Would anyone really do that? You mean it's all part of an act? - Yes, why not? Because it hurts not to know what happened. Because it's worse than any certainty. That's why. Hi, honey. What are you doing? Marie's room will become a gym. Hey, what's the matter? The police told me Marie died of internal bleeding. It must've lasted hours. The less exposed to the air she is, the more time I have. So this isn't the surprise you lured me here with? Just a moment. - What's that? - A pellet. Under the skin. - Not dramatic, but... - A shotgun pellet isn't dramatic? It didn't have any force or effect, so... The girl was shot at. Anyone outside this cellar would call it dramatic. We have the pellet, and the tears. - On her heels. - Right. The only penetrations from outside. But they look different. The wax encloses the spot around the pellet, but... - Not the tears in the heels. - No. How can that be? I don't know yet, but I know something else. The victim was pregnant. Five weeks. A pregnant daughter meant more work. Another child in the house. Maybe it all got too much for him. The parents of handicapped children don't have to be good people, do they? - We should question the father again. - OK. But not today. Tomorrow. I have to go home. - Want to go home. - OK. No backtalk? No talk at all? Is that Joseph Malters' laptop? Komlatschek wants it back. - Ok. - No... That's a lot of OK s. What are you doing? The 11th of September, 1994. Your parents' sailing accident. The day your mother died. You're working on a private matter, right? Still looking for your father. The calculations are clear. Look at this. The accident happened here. The wind and current moved everything on the surface there. But my father's life jacket was found here. He must've swam. Let's assume he survived. Why did he disappear? It doesn’t make any sense, Zeiler. Of course you want to make sure. But maybe you're getting carried away, and this is just wishful thinking. Have a nice evening. You too. - Hello, Daddy. - Hello, honey. Everything OK? Come and sit down. - Salad? Again? - Try it first before you start whining. I think it's nice to have a meal together again. I'm sorry, my mind was still on the job. If you really don't like it, make a sandwich. Trisomy 21. It brings it all back, you know. - It'll be great. The batteries have arrived. They'll be mounted this afternoon. Take your time. - Zeiler, police. We talked on the phone. - Is-there any news? - Nobody likes you. That's not news to me. You didn't re-enroll Marie at the care facility. How could you know she would disappear? This is really disgraceful. My wife's colleagues suspect me of killing my daughter, and planning it too? Come with me, please. Come on in. Over there. I only see my daughter. Others see real art. That's the first and only water color Marie ever painted. - And? - She got a stipend, In England. - That's why you didn't re-enroll her? Right. You stopped paying, buried yourself in your work. Suspicious. As if a burden was lifted from your shoulders. Of course I worked, Like a madman. What would you have done to cope? And the 100,000 euros? What did you need them for? So now I have to justify my not donating? I had it checked. You withdrew 100,000 from your account. Just after Marie disappeared. What did you do with the money? This underwear belonged to Marie. And I paid. No police. 100,000 euros for the life of my daughter. The files don't mention blackmail. Because this was a freeloader. Marie's letters came soon after. It became clear to me it was someone who took advantage of the situation. - He never got in touch again. - The letters were fake. We know that today. The police know, you know, I know We didn't know at the time. Everyone thought she ran away. - So did I. - And you never told anyone? Shame. I don't think you know what that's like. I was ashamed. Everyone did their best to find her. My brother-in-law was looking for her around the clock. Marie was pregnant. You really think all she did in the woods was walk? Get out. I'm taking this. Those are definitely Marie Hausler's panties. It fits. Her body's lying in the morgue without underwear. Do we have a case of kidnapping? One that went wrong. We should broaden the scope of our investigation. Or maybe not. You told me to check out the landlady No, I said I'd be grateful if you did. - I'm still grateful. So? - Good. Her place burned down. She blamed' Marie but couldn't prove anything Elisabeth Ludwig rebuilt the place, the insurance paid. I know. She had no insurance. But she did get the money. - Yes. Very suddenly. That's the best lead we had in a long time. The old lady hated Marie, but profited from her. Make a house call. You'll like her, she's a sweetheart - And what will you do? - I'm going to the garage. To get a sticker? A sticker? The van needs a technical certificate. You've got guts. Your father was a good swimmer, Hannah. Meet her at Pension Ludwig - Would you like milk or sugar? - A little milk. My pleasure. - Have you had the pleasure yet? What's with you? Mrs, Ludwig is nice. So you're one of them too. - We have a few more questions. - Again. The coffee is 3.50. - I'd like a receipt. - I'd like some peace. We're out of luck. You deducted the rebuilding of your boarding house from your taxes. That's why there's a list of the cost. I'm terrified. 100,000 euros. You didn't inherit them, you weren't insured. You blackmailed Hausler, cashed in, and no one found out. You'd hit the girl before. Too hard this time? - Nonsense. She died. You made the best of it. You still think you deserved the money. You want to bet the coffee? We'll find your DNA on the underwear. That mongo slut. Nothing but trouble. I smacked her once because she had to leave my dog alone. I never hurt her, and I certainly didn't kill her. She didn't leave the panties for fun, did she? They were left in one of the rooms. I wonder how you'll get out of this. The slut was meeting someone here who lived in one of the rooms. -Aman? Yes. It didn't interest me. - What did he look like? - I forgot. But you kept the underwear, right? To put one over on Hausler. His retarded kid whoring around. He deserved it. - Don't you have any notes? - It was fifteen years ago. I told Hausler a thousand times I didn't want her here. But it went on, even after the fire. Then she was gone. What do I know? This was my chance. The case has lapsed now. He can go to hell. And you too. Unbelievable, but it worked. It passed inspection. So? - Marie met a man here. - But Mrs. Ludwig doesn't remember him. - There must be a guestbook. Forget it. She's been ignoring the rules for years. I think we asked the wrong person. Marie, that's who we have to talk to. Marie herself. My husband told me Marie died very slowly. Is that true? We're afraid it is. You said she only painted people she liked. Yes. My husband labeled all the paintings. Who's on them, when they were made This is Marie's grandfather. That's Manfred. That's our neighbor. This is Mrs. Ludwig's dog. - Yes. That one too. There's no name on this one. October, 15 years ago. That would fit the time frame. Who is it? I have no idea. A crooked face, eyes close together. Couldn't it be your boss? You're right. If that's not a scar... Stop. And one, two, three, four, and five. Very good. We're rocking, The show is tomorrow at 11:00 am. Be on time. Have you had surgery in the lumbar region? Yes, I had an operation on my appendix once. . You've had sex with a ward. - A good start of your working life. - Marie saw you naked and painted you - Is that why she had to die? Because she was pregnant? - Pregnant? - Yes. And the child was yours. Don't worry, the DNA test will prove it. Marie and I were a couple. Even if it wasn't allowed. We loved each other. This is a lot of fun. This is a wonderful video. - She was a pure soul. - My prince. She swept me along. - You have to call me a princess. - Princess. Into life. We showed Elisabeth Ludwig a picture of you. - You lived at the boarding house. - Yes, until found a place of my own. Was Marie there with you, the day she disappeared? It looks like you're the last one to see her alive. I don't think so. Excuse me? - She called me on the phone. - What do you mean? I'd given her my cellphone, for the walk through the woods. - For safety's sake. I had a phone... - What did she say? Marie was often hard to understand on the phone. And she was very excited, she.. I think she was afraid. Afraid of what? Something bad happened to a friend in the woods. And you simply brushed it aside? A friend in danger. And you never told anyone? My cellphone, my secret love, what could I do And we all thought she'd turn up again. This friend.. Marie was very hard to understand, but I think she said Ralf. Or Rolf. Wolf, maybe? Please. Excuse me. My colleagues. This is really not a good time. It never is, unfortunately. Marie made a call the day she died. She was out walking with the dog. On your hunting grounds. That doesn't mean a thing. - She mentioned something bad. There's a shotgun pellet in her hip. Put two and two together. You once were a cop, you can do it. You shot the dog first, didn't you? - Put that down, right now! - You asshole. - You didn't look for her, you killed her. - Manfred. It was an accident, Manfred. The dog was out there on its own. I thought he'd kill game. I didn't even see Marie. Want to hear it. What you did to my child. Out. I didn't do anything to your daughter, I swear. Our son was called Marcel, Mr. Hausler. He had strong symptoms of Trisomy 21, and was always sick. We took care of him with all our might.. But he died when he was three. You blame yourselves, as parents. Did we do something wrong? Could we have done more? You want to give your child the best life, right? Then you suddenly realize you can't save this life. You can't do anything. And that drives you insane. I can understand your pain, Mr. Hausler. Believe me. Don't do it, please. I was sitting up here. On that day. The woods were denser then. The deforestation wasn't as advanced as it is now. I didn't see her. We had serious problems back then with poaching dogs. Then I heard this noise. - I aimed, and then I.. - Fired at the dog. And then? Marie screamed. She screamed horribly loudly. I never would've hurt her, never. She ran away through the undergrowth. I couldn't follow her at all she was so fast. And she ran, and ran... Until her cries... Finally died down. I went looking for her. For one day... For weeks... for months. I've been living with this guilt for a decade and a half. - Are you comfortable in my chair? - I have something for you. Various penetrations Egger called them. The pellet wound is insignificant. Like all else, it was covered with wax. On the victim's heels, we have lengthwise marks and traces of gravel. -And? That's just it. But, instead of and - But no wax. What does that mean? - You know the answer. She didn't necessarily turn into a wax corpse in the lake. Excuse me? Wax corpses develop anywhere without air to cause decay. Loamy soil and a high water level are enough. But the body was in the lake. Because someone threw her in as a wax corpse. - She could've been buried for years. - In very damp surroundings. Those on her heels are drag marks. Someone moved the body in its waxy state, only recently. OK, why would you do that? The spot was disturbed. They were afraid of discovery. Instead of a few bones, a whole corpse would be found. The killer wasn't counting on that. We checked. All letters are fake, and without prints. You're right. - Except the fourth one. Right. When did the fourth letter arrive. With Marie' prints? Did you notice? When your unit t was doubting the letters were real. - And assumed foul play. - What does that mean? That you looked in the wrong direction for 15 years. I'm sincerely sorry. The killer knew how the case was going? That's exactly what I mean. Malters only discussed the case with Manfred Hausler, who knew everything. The gravel in the tears on her heels. Remember the gravel paths near the care home It's also near the woods. Of course. In her panic, she ran to her school. Makes sense. What's up with this building site? The pond has to be redeveloped. But there's a building freeze. - Why? - Because of the noise. The grotto has to be done, too. But the digging was too loud. - We'll continue in the fall. Who ordered this? - I wanted the pupils to see... - Who? Mrs. Hausler got terribly excited. - What could I do? - Where is the grotto? - The entrance is on the right. - Take him to the car. Let me do it, Zeiler. Can you manage? Wonderful. - Be careful. - Thanks. Yes. Loam. Moisture. Everything fits. This is where she was buried for fifteen years. Incredible. Let's say Jasmin Hausler killed Marie fifteen years ago. Why? What if the landlady was right? It all makes sense. Yes? Does it? Maybe she was seeing Hausler before Marie died. She wanted more. But he chose the family. Then Jasmin knew about the investigation. This is water color paper. - Yes, so? We never wondered how Marie's prints got on the paper. That's the only water color she ever painted. Hausler confirmed it. You called him on the phone? Just now? - Yes, why? - Did you mention the letter? The paper? Sure. Hausleris not a suspect anymore. Jasmin is supposed to be at the boatyard. Hausler knows. He's not stupid. He knows what we think. What do we think? Marie's prints were on it. You used them, didn't you? For the fake letter. What are you talking about? They asked me who I discussed these things with. Only with Corinna. And with you. You're staying here! Please, tell me it isn't true. Tell me I haven't lived with my child's killer for 15 years. We grieved for Marie together. I love you. - I'll check the office. - All right. Search the hangar and the outbuildings, OK? There was a boat, it's gone now. Zeiler, I need you now. Please. Please. Come on. Take my hand. Very good. Just one more step. Just go. Marie came walking up. From nowhere. It was dark already. I was just putting the car back, when... I heard this horrible collision. You have to believe me, it was an accident. I thought she was dead. She wasn't moving anymore. Fifteen years of lies for an accident. You pretended you loved me for fifteen years. That's not true. You love me, and that's why you killed my daughter? I broke up with you. I told you I wouldn't leave my wife. Not while Marie needed a family. And what do you do? You kill her? First Marie, then my wife went, and who was always there? Pretending to feel sorry for me? You. What's going on inside your head? I think I found them. Up there. You let my daughter... die very slowly. You disgust me so much. Get away from your wife. Two steps back. This time I'll shoot. You'll never forgive me. And I won't forgive myself. I had a brother? We wanted to be a normal family for you, and not talk about it. Maybe that wasn't the best idea. And how did he die? We were at home. It was very cozy and relaxed. As always And then Marcel stopped breathing. Look. You're laughing a lot in these pictures. Marcel liked the van. Very much. It's time. Yes, I know. Will you take Hugo, sweetheart? You didn't think I'd really sell the van, did you? No, I didn't. Can you take this? Zeiler? Is everything OK? I need your help. I have a lead. My father's still alive.
