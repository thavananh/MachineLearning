On behalf of the men, the opposition leader, Thorappan Purushottaman and on behalf of the women, you see our favorite star Pournami who is our hope are facing each other now. It's the final round. Will our women's president live up to the expectations of Ponnapuram and win the sport? Or will the opposition leader, Purushottaman win the chair? Both are in good form and the competition is getting exciting. Nail it, leader. Don't let it go. Yay! No... No! Hey, get up and leave. What is he doing? Get up and leave. I'll urinate and be back. - I'll give you company. Oh, no! Sir's head is broken! I declare the Women's Day celebration open. Old age pension for women. E P Maruthama. Home for women scheme. R Thankamani, P K Sujata. Women get all the appreciation and acknowledgement. Do we at least have a toilet in this village? We have no freedom to even do a play It's been ages since I watched a good porn film, boss. We being the opposition party cannot sit idle like this. You read it. - Ebluferac... Tea. Here's your tea. - Dad... We don't want tea right now. - Don't you? We're going crazy already. Okay, then all of you may have lunch before you leave. I'll go to the kitchen and finish the chores. Will you read that? Eb luf... I think it's written backwards. Oh! Then there's no doubt. It's written by him. The president's husband. Eb luferac... Ruoy efil... - What? Read it again. Eb luferac. Ruoy efil si ni regnad. What's that? - By PPP PPP?! Give that to me, let me see. Well... Oh, I see. President, didn't you understand? It's a threat to your life. 'Be careful, your life is in danger'. I see. He used to say that he'd break my legs or hands. Now, he has come down to threatening me for life. And this PPP... We all know what it is. Protestants Party of Men! He is such a fool. Does anyone write an anonymous letter? PPP, he has written the name of his party directly. He hasn't written that straight. Then? - He has written that backward too. Look, PPP! Such a dumbwit! Come on, pass that. I'll give the speech. No, that's not a problem. There should be audience. The police... Sister... - Paru Kutty. Why did you get so late? - Be happy that I reached. Dad is so worked up. I know how difficult it was to reach till here. Come, get in. - I'll drive. Okay. How was your examination? I faired so well. Once you pass out, I will make an office of a lawyer in this village. In order to safeguard the rights of women, we need a woman lawyer. In short, you are determined to not let the men be at peace. Oh, please! Why is this parked in the middle of the road? I think, it broke down. Yes. I don't see anyone around. Such a nuisance! Paru... Sister! Paru... Paru... Sister... Who are you? Sister... Sister, come on. Move. Get aside. Don't push, just move. Nurse, please stop. Who are the rascals behind this? The police is investigating it. They won't be spared. Nurse, we want to see the president or we won't leave/ The doctor is examining her/ How is she now, doctor? Her pressure is high. That won't come back to normal until she seeks revenge. She is like her mom, Savitri. One thing is sure. Since they thrashed both of you, it was not an attempt to murder/ Many people want to know, if they were physically abused/ Not many, but only you. So then you can scream your lungs out and spread the news/ That is what she wore this uniform for, one fine morning/ Am I right, Gauri? It's the lack of awareness/ I can't help it. She must have gone to some channel/ I am sure about one thing/ - What is it? The opposition party is behind this. They have no strength to even stand straight. How can they? What if they gave a quotation, to threaten and control them? Hey, careful. You don't be scared. - I must say, you are great. The anger she had on her lover as he betrayed her was vented out by her on me. That's how evil she is. So was that you who hired men to get her thrashed? Of course. You really deserve to be our leader. On behalf of PPP, I gave that quotation. You're just awesome. Come on, let's celebrate. Where did you gather the guts to do this, boss? You won't mend your ways despite beating you so much. You think you can get away, don't you? Madam, I'll go inside. Please don't beat me up, I will urinate. I told you. God! - There he goes! Father! Grandpa! Boss, she broke my spine. I shall take care of you at home. You had the courage to give quotation against women. Right? - It was not me! Then who did this? That is what I'm wondering too. Who is the evil master mind, that loves us so much? Anyway, you can leave only after I allow you to. Nalini... Give them each a bucket and broom. Let them clean and mop the entire police station. Okay, madam. If you miss to clean the lavatory... I will clean everything here. - You! My back broke! I sat on you by mistake when madam scared me. I swear. I'm not lying. A goat and a dangerous beast! Let him come here. Stop there, I say. What is it? You didn't milk the goat today, did you? Neither did you take them for grazing. That's because, I have a problem of urinating often, as you know. I'll be just back. Tell me the truth and then, you may go to the toilet. I was at the leader's house... Not in his house, you were at the police station. Don't be mistaken that it's all over. Ones who hurt our president and her sister, we'll skin them alive. What is that? I was just calling out to the goats. God! This man is so irresponsible. Don't annoy me any further. "As beautiful and colorful..." Isn't there anything else? Yes, I'm coming. Here it is done. Chutney, pickle And porridge... - Porridge?! I didn't have the time to cook rice and vegetable. Just for one day, please adjust... - Not possible! I am already worked up thinking about our president. You're serving me this porridge! He hasn't learnt to cook in these many years. I put in so much efforts to make this. Every dog has its day. A girl puts up with torture since the day she is born. On knowing the baby born is a girl child, there are male chauvenists who ask their wife to kill the child. That's the society we live in.- Excuse me. According to what you say, Ms Gauri, it looks like, all men are trouble makers. Give me the remote, mom. - Stay quiet. Here... There's no one who feeds them on time. I have to do everything. Subaida... It's been half an hour since I asked for a Sulaimani. First, let me arrive at a decision on this. Sulaimani, my foot! This life threat and the attack by goons prove it that way. Shall I ask you something? 'What is...' - Isn't Gauri rocking? - Absolutely, yes. Dear Subaida, one Sulaimani please. I won't spare you today. Forget Sulaimani tea, I won't offer you even water today. No man in this village have to rest peacefully after having injured and sent our women folk to the hospital. What did I do? I taught him a good lesson. Really? Wasn't that dress good? I knew, it would look beautiful on TV. Many people called me to appreciate. You share it on social media. Let more people see it. Okay, Usma... I am really tired today. You disconnect the line. I am tired of these messages. Hello, how are you doing? Sleep that side. Better. Don't try to come closer or touch. Move your hand aside. - Okay. I just wish the trip in the yatch gets viral on Youtube. And then, I will be a celebrity. Meenakshi. Dear Meenakshi... Speak up. Shouldn't we plan a child? The Panchayat's new decision is to plan a child carefully. When was this decision taken? Just before a few minutes, it was announced. That's not fair. President cannot impose her decision on the Panchayat members. This is the right of every man. I am tired of you... Will you lie down? This village will never prosper, neither will anything good happen. Dear... - What is it? Kaveri... What is it? There's a boil on my body, here. It will break in some time naturally. We're already in a fit of rage. Don't you dare! It's a flop. Because of one stupid quotation, we're deprived of what we got once in a blue moon at least. We're far ahead of men in every work today. We're lagging behind, in only one aspect. Muscle power. Men who are rogues need to be faced with strength. Somehow, we don't have that. If women start hitting back, no man will bully us anymore. Right. Even if we fail to hit back, we must at least have the power to defend ourselves. We need to be that strong at least. But that's not possible overnight. So, what should we do, president? Women must be physically trained. They must learn self defence skills. Karate or Boxing? Wrestling is better. The local style is the best. A collective training of all. That's what I intend. We must get that done by including it in our defence scheme and using the Panchayat's money for it. At the earliest possible. Right. No man should dare again to raise his hand or leg at a woman hereafter. That's the decision of this Panchayat. It's easy to decide. But... You check it. Here. Mary Kom is a woman boxer. In women's karate, we have her. Okay. If you want to see more, she is a wrestling champion. Sakshi Mallik. Good. How about getting one of these? Talk about something that's practically possible. Why are you showing this to me then? Just to instigate me? See if we can find someone. Don't we need a lady trainer itself? That's the difficult part. Tea. Tea. Is it necessary to hire a lady trainer itself? Won't that be too much? Why so? Women have started going to space. What's this? Why did they go there? President... President, there's nothing more to think. We'll nail it. I've found an amazing person. I'll come there. President, I have found the right person. Really? - Yes. Is it P T Usha? No. She is from a far away place, Kadathanatu Madhavi Amma. She is a Kalari trainer. I see only men here. Come, let's see. Yes? Kadathanatu Madhavi Amma? Please come. (Indistinct Chatter on TV) (Indistinct Chatter on TV) (Indistinct Chatter on TV) Come on, behead him. Yes, move it that way, now bend and yes! That's the way. Come on, in the air and stab! Turn around. Jump and stab him now swiftly. His neck! Three attacks, jump and hop. Yes, sit down and then rise. Yes, that's the right way... "Vadakkan Veeragatha" is the film. She loves to watch the movie. You! Mammooty was in the air. And you turned it off. What has happened to your foot? Last week, she watched the movie Mamangam on TV. And got excited enough to take a weapon... Who are you? We're from Ponnapuram. We women there wish to learn the art of Kalari. And for that, we are looking for a lady mentor. How can I come in this state? We want a woman trainer. Any of your disciples? All good students got married and left. - Right. There are hardly any women who is as serious as mom in this. You will find many men. Is that okay? At Dharmapuri, which is close by here, a wrestling competition is going on. All of them are my students. But how is Kalari and wrestling... Kalari includes everything. Wrestling, Karate, Boxing, it includes everything. Had I been able to stand, I would've demonstrated to you. No, that's okay. Just arrange a person for us. The chief of that village, Dhopanna is the organizer. I'll give you a letter. Radha, get me a paper and pen. President, so what did you decide? Is this why I sent you both to Ms Madhavi Amma's house? We don't want to get into any activity with men involved in it. We have no other choice, Gauri. We cannot find a lady trainer. That shouldn't be a problem. But on seeing a man, my hands start shivering. That's the problem. - No, that's not. This is like surrending to men. If that is what you're going to do, don't expect my cooperation. Nothing will happen if you think one sidedly. Not the path, but the destination is important. Brother, where's the competition going on? Come, we're going there too. - Quick. - Let's go. Our very own dearest, the backbone of our village, Dhopanna Everonn trophy Fifth wrestling competition finale is now going to begin. So, let the Dhopanna Everonn Trophy Wrestling Finale begin! Dhopanna! The organizer, Dhopanna! My dear friends and loved ones, I greet you all... My dad who died of mom's beatings had a great desire or wish that there should be a wrestling competition memorial after the name of me, his son who is alive. I have got an opportunity to train all the women folks in Ponnapuram Panchayat with wrestling and other martial arts. I have got this golden opportunity. Unfortunately, in the recent times, a few old hags turned against me and played some dirty tricks. Because of that... Because of that... I withdraw. The golden opportunity will be passed on to the champion of this wrestling finale. Our chief guests are here. Let the grand finale of the wrestling competition begin now. For the finale, here we have among us, Richard Jugnu. Yay! Cheer for him! All the best! And to challenge Richard Jugnu, we have among us, Chandru Rajeev. Come on, show us an exciting fight. Ready, one, two, three... In the grand finale, Chandru Rajeev has won! Isn't he handsome? Hi... Stop it. Stop the drum! Stop it, I say! Phew! Phew! What was that? That's a tradition we follow while passing through this way. I see. That's good. Yes, carry on. Why are you standing there? Come up. Bye. Get me a glass of water. The women are hell bent I guess. This is women liberation... There he goes! - Catch him. How was the band? Wasn't it awesome? - Absolutely. - They're women from our place. There's a lot more to see. Come. Come in. There's no problem even if you step in putting your left foot forward. You are anyway ruined. What did you say? Nothing, I just expressed my concern. Come in, now. Come on in, son. Don't fall, walk carefully. You'll fall in every step ahead. Come. This is your room. I have kept the room spick and span. Is that enough? It's more than enough. Chandru, what will be your menu? Pournami has given special instructions to ask and get things done perfectly. So, the president is a loving person, isn't she? - Of course. It's better you behave yourself. What? Don't I have the right to murmur to myself? You tell me the menu. Can I get some chicken soup? Chicken soup? Yes, mutton blood roast. Mutton bloo... I am hearing this for the first time. What a name! You would not have heard the menu of martial art trainers. Never mind, I will manage. Better for you if you do so. - President's dad, stop there. What did you murmur now? Look! I have a habit of talking to myself... - People who talk to themselves are usually cowards. In that case, all the men in this village are cowards. Many of them suffer from diarrhea out of fear. Ouch! - No visible bruises though. Poor thing! He is stuck with bad luck. When has luck favored him? However, I never expected a man to turn against us. Despite being a man, he'll be our enemy! - Of course, he is one. Take a sip of this. - Raise your head. Are you giving him Soda? Why? Can't you have it raw? We have no control over women already. I wonder what our plight would be after they learn wrestling. We'll spend more on oil and unguents hereafter. I'm sure you remember the pain. God has blessed me with two legs. So, I'll run out of her sight. She can hit me only when I return home. If so, please take me along. Why? - I'd rather jump in front of a train than be a part of this forlorn cause lead by a hopeless leader. 'Eggs for sale.' Huh? - What? Do you want eggs? Go away! We're in pain. Not a good time for eggs. Get lost! - You go! She dares to taunt us. They're acting smart ever since that wrestler got here. Traitor! We cannot afford to let him stay here for long. Agreed! We got to get rid of him soon. Women don't have to learn anything new. We must put an end to it. - Yes! 'My dear children, what you are doing?' 'Hurry up! We're running late.' - Sister Come along! Walk fast. Hurry up. Mother-in-law! I've left food covered on the table, arranged medicines beside your cot and have washed clothes. I'll dry them later. I hope it is okay. Darlings, say bye to grandma. Grandma, bye! - Bye, Grandma. See you soon, dear. Okay, grandma. Who is calling? - Hey dad! Gosh! It's your mom. Hello! Yes, Ragini. We are just leaving. Nah! Your mother is doing fine. I'm taking good care of her. How could you say such a thing, Ragini? Why don't you ask her directly? Talk to her. Mother-in-law, Ragini is calling from Singapore. Hello, dear! How are you doing? Yeah! I've no issues here, dear. Nowhere in the world can you find a village like ours, where women can lead a blissful life. Exactly, dear. I'll call later. You heard that? We're running late for school. Call at night. We'll take leave, mother-in-law. Come on! Walk fast. Dad, you are hopeless. Hello, who is this? - Hi! I am here to introduce him. I am Madanan! Though I am a man, I am a ladies' man. I mean I support women. Likewise, we've come to meet Lakshmi madam and not you. Oh, I see. - Hello! Please carry on. Come along, darling. - Now we got late because of you, dad. Greetings, Lakshmi madam. Greetings! He is Chandru, our new trainer. Oh! Meet Lakshmi madam. The beloved grandmother of our town. Please bless me, grandma. He knows to respect women! Get up, dear. Wishing you all success! We'll start training from tomorrow. Kindly inaugurate the training, madam. I'm sure you have seen this kind of adoration and festivity in your town as well. Unlike in other places, we don't pay respects to her as a matter of formality. Her statue represents the fire in every women of this town, who lead life with self respect. Savitri Devi! 'Today, the wonders that you see in our village are results' 'of Savitri Devi's hard-work years ago!' Before that this village was controlled by men. Our village was led by a male chauvinist called Parameswaran and his lousy followers. A shameful governance which didn't have any value for women's dignity. We can pay only so much to women and that should do! 'Unjust policies against women' 'were one of the prime issues.' This is unfair, sir. How can you pay men more than women for the same task? Women also slog equally at work. Oh! Since when did women start talking in Ponnapuram? What's wrong if we did? You got to pay equal wages to women for the hard work they do. If you fail to do so, no women will come to work at Village Council from tomorrow. Let's go. 'It was just the beginning.' 'Savitri Devi raised her voice and initiated protest' 'against every problem' 'in our society.' They have arrived. You've come on time. Greetings, sir. - Greetings! Give it! - I can't win with just your vote. Don't worry! We've been controlling this place for so long. What is this? Many years have gone by since we requested for a bridge here. We still traverse for hours across bumpy roads, hills and forests to reach the outside world. We're having discussions about starting a boat service soon. Wow! Like that will come true. We want development. Being a man is not sufficient to achieve development. You need to grow a spine. Nah! I am trying... We submitted pleas requesting access to clean drinking water. But our children are falling sick everyday from drinking contaminated water. Further you take the trouble of visiting us only before the elections. You don't have to do that anymore. We'll handle the issues on our own. What's happening here? Let's go. Complete waste of time. Do we have to go elsewhere? Don't waste your time dreaming big. Women are designed to be in kitchen. Don't involve in governance. Do you follow? Back then, there was a toddy shop where men would protest and engage in brawl! It was run by Parameswaran's close aide. It was a hub for all illegal activities. [SINGING OLD MALAYALAM SONG] [SINGING OLD MALAYALAM SONG] [SINGING OLD MALAYALAM SONG] [SINGING OLD MALAYALAM SONG] [SINGING OLD MALAYALAM SONG] [SINGING OLD MALAYALAM SONG] What are you doing? I have to pack this. Where is our son? He is somewhere here. Bhairava! - I am here, dad. Serve this to our guests. Give it to me, mom. - Fill in some water. Do it this way. [SINGING OLD MALAYALAM SONG] [SINGING OLD MALAYALAM SONG] [SINGING OLD MALAYALAM SONG] [SINGING OLD MALAYALAM SONG] Ayyappa! The women and children are unable to live in peace here. Either shut down your shop or relocate it elsewhere. Who are you to say? Unniyarcha or Jhansi Rani? I won't shut it down. Go away. - Don't assume that I can't take action. - Nuisance. I very well know how to shut it down. But I've come to request you. Listen to me. - Hey, this is my shop. Even I have a family that I got to support. Go away, sister. 'Even after repeated requests, there was no respite.' 'Soon, a huge tragedy hit our village' 'that put an end to this menace.' 'Savitri led other women to protest.' Are you happy now? Didn't I warn you earlier? But you paid no heed. Mom! Go! Go away from here. Get going! Let's leave. Come along! 'The protest led by women' 'under her leadership' 'had changed the course of history in our village.' Come on! 'From that day, ' 'this Ponnapuram turned into a women's sovereign.' A land that promises a bright future and offers solutions to women's problems. Savitri gained the support of women from the neighboring villages as well. She took charge of the governance and became the first Woman President of our Village Council. 'However, Savitri could not' 'serve as the President for' 'more than six years.' 'One fine day' 'when she was returning home from a meeting' The Village Council will... What happened? What is it, President? Nothing! Let's go. Ouch! What is wrong? A snake bite! President! Oh dear God! President! - 'It was not an accident.' 'but a planned murder.' 'The men got jealous of women's progress in governance' 'schemed this murder as revenge.' Open your eyes. Look at me. President! My dear God! God! Gosh! Despite a lot of troubles, she agreed to contest for President's post, obliging our requests. Since that day, she's been the head of our Village Council. Even after all these years, if she who works hard for the progress of our village and other womenfolk of Savitri's team are subject to injustice, it would amount as a disgrace to our village. So get started with their training. Be confident and move ahead. It's time for women to protect one another! Yes! Up! Up! Come on! Move it! Attack! Gosh! - How dare you! Take this! Yes! You are right! Go! Hold it up! Attack! Hold here. Press down! We have never lost! - Never will we! We won't lose! What is the need for this training? Why don't you take up some chores at home? Hold on your thoughts! I am an intelligent being. Is that why you don't attend training? - Yes. Intelligent ones don't need to move a muscle. Very sorry! That's the curse of this land. Hey, where is my protein shake? I am busy washing my undergarment. Protein shake! My foot! How dare she... My God! I haven't got my glass of goat milk yet. It's ready. Here's your glass of goat milk. Hold this! Don't poke my eyes. You! If you were at home, what took you so long to open? I was making fish curry. Do you want to get kicked? Fish curry! I raised that hen with lot of love. I got to gain muscle power. Let me have this at least. You don't need that kind of muscle gain. We're finally at Peruvannapuram. Not Peruvannapuram, dude. This is Ponnapuram! An ideal spot! Let me try calling him again. Ayurveda medicines! There's no signal here. Such a lousy place. My hand aches from all the driving. Had we come by boat, we'd have reached, but you insisted on bike. What do we do now? This place looks deserted. None to help! Thomas! We might have to spend the rest of the night here. I've a nagging pain in my stomach. I got to pee. But I can't find a toilet. Toilet? Just do it there. You fool! You are right! It's truly a pleasure of a kind. Every man has to do something different. Something different! Yes! Who is the disturbance? Why have they turned on lights? Who is it? [SINGING MALAYALAM SONG] I am caught! Stop peeing! Gosh! - Ouch! - It hurts a lot. -Spare us. Oh dear God! Do you know why I am hitting you now? For bringing liquor into our village. Ouch! - How dare you! Do you know why I am hitting you? To have urinated in a public place. Ouch! Gosh! What was this for? For you are a man! Tell me the truth. Who are you? Where do you come from? - We... Answer me! We are students of City Law College and we've come to meet Chandru. Chandru? Yes! - Yup! Is it this guy? Yes! It's him. We've come to meet him. You are law college students. How do you know physical trainer Chandru? Tell me! He is our classmate. Chandru and Paru are madly in love! Pass it on! 'Throw!' 'Look here, dude.' "The journey!" Paru, why aren't you answering? My house, my village, the natives, our local traditions! You can't tolerate any of it, Chandru. No man with an identity of his own, can ever stand it. My dad won't be cross with me even if I elope with a girl of my choice. I need only your consent, Paru. I don't wish to elope from home, Chandru. I want us to get married with my sister's consent! I need the blessings of every men and women in Ponnapuram. I'll come and convince your sister! I'll ensure to get the consent of your folks to marry you. No matter what I have to do for that. He just mentioned about this trip to us. We came all the way here to surprise him! He doesn't know about it. 'Sister!' Stop thinking about it. I'm sure your Village Council won't crash on hiring a male trainer. But I feel... Don't worry! Take a look at his prowess in the competition. Hey! - Please don't. Hey! What happened, sister? All this was your plan. Am I right? What plan? Didn't you invite him here? Sister, I... - Don't touch! Don't flatter me. If my plan was to elope, I could have done it long ago, sister. But I've told him that I wish to get married with all your consent. I will never consent to it. Let go, dear. - No matter what you say, I can never agree to it! We'll find a groom for you! Someone who suits our family and village. So, don't you dare dream about marrying your lover boy! Not just you! No woman in Ponnapuram can do so. Leader! Boss! What is the matter? - Earthquake! Disaster in Ponnapuram house! All women are headed to the ground to fight that trainer. What for? President, I had warned you! Sister, enough with fishing. Come on. - Go ahead! 'Listen to your inner voice says T C George.' Hey!- Buddy! -Dude! Come with us. What is the matter? - Just come. I'll tell you! - Get that shoes. - I'll set right the governance. All of us together will definitely teach him a lesson. Kochu Keshava! - Don't sit there. Come on! Do you know what happened? - What is it, boss? There's an explosion! - What? - Yes! Come fast. Not that side. Come this side, dude! My army needs me. Give them some more beatings, sister. Useless fellows! God, save my children and me! Such a chaos! - Move aside. School is closed today! Closed for two days. No more school! There will be no milk or paper either. - Where are you going? There's no point in answering a spineless soul like you! Get lost! Don't be disrespectful, dear. - I wish to slap them. Don't do it. You have two daughters. Let's not bother them. Walk faster, thick headed! Women are easy to fool! But not here! This is Ponnapuram! Don't worry! They've told us about everything. Okay! Having come this far, let me come out clean! I am here for Paru. - Hey! Is this why you pulled an act of being our trainer? Mind you! We can make you run for your life in Ponnapuram! We could have eloped. You'll have to pass through us before you lay your hands on him! Hey, stand here. Where do you think you are going? They are my friends and will be on my side. Come on, dude. Be bold, buddy! We're are with you! No one can harm them! The men will decide the course of play after this. Dear Chandru, don't worry. You can stay here for as long as you want. You are like my brother! Please eat. Yes, we are the men of Ponnapuram! We serve beef roast to our beloved guests. Hey! - Don't touch that. Enjoy! Stay confident, buddy. We'll ensure to get you married to Paru! Yeah right! What can we expect in return? What do you want? You have to help us in putting an end to this atrocious female governance. Even if it is for one day, I wish to take charge as the President. God! I have to prove my worth to her! - No way! Says a loser who hasn't proved his worth since wedding! That's enough, dude. Don't take a dig at me. I have used all my wealth towards PPP group and wastrels like you! You dare to mock me! I'll show what a loser can do! Kochu Keshava, pour me another round. Such a disgrace! How will she face our people after this? Men are archenemies of women! It's a proven fact. This is why I was against hiring a male trainer since the start. Give it to her. You should have verified, President. All of us together brought him here. I didn't expect it to turn out like this. Anyway, I'm not going to let any outsider stay here for some days. A secret meeting! - Shut the door! Who let this guy come here? Should I get pass from Parliament to step in? We can even sleep here. As an Indian Citizen, I have the right to stay anywhere in India. I don't need a visa or passport to do so. What do men have to do in Village coucil office? Go away! Oh! You must listen to the opponent's view as well! Legally, we have every right to voice out our concerns as men! [SINGS MALAYALAM SONG] They took the trouble of bringing him here to defeat us! You! - Hey! We made a small mistake. Don't try to use it against us. I will do it. Didn't you get scared? We'll use it against you politically and get hold of the authority again. Very soon, I'll become the President. One day or the other, I'll sit on this chair! That's enough! Don't go overboard. Come. I wish to pay heed to his words. Wait and watch! Ponnapuram men are about to begin the game. A majestic start! I'll see you. We'll meet you there! Okay! You must be very careful while you engage with Police. It is better not to raid the party office or the opposition party leader's house at present. I'm Eshwari Amma, who had foreseen the liquor disaster long ago. I am the one who asked Savitri to contest in the election. I knew years back that this village will be governed by women. Hear it from me now. The rule of women in Ponnapuram will come to an end. I foresee all the chances of your authority being dismissed. Don't scare us. We came here for peace of mind. She ruined the peace we had. How can you say that? I am not an ordinary palmist. I have influence on politics and its ways. I'm a political fortune teller. I will say what I have to, straight on your face. My predictions have come true and it will even in future. Eshwari Amma, please calm down. Be seated. Since Kausalya is insisting... In short, what do you imply, Eshwari Amma? You need to be very careful. A love war is expected soon, in this village. A strong love revolution! Paru. Paru... Chandru... Are you alright? My phone is with my sister/ Are you alright? Hey, I'm fine. I just had to switch my loyalties to the opposition. But I never imagined, things would get so worse. Everything will end well. Like you wished, with everyone's consent... But be by my side, as a strong pillar. Should our girls grow up seeing all this? President, get her married as soon as possible. - Right. She is a grown up girl now. It's the arrogance as she is well educated. No girl in this village is as educated as her, that's the ego. Right. I know what needs to be done. President... President. Lakshmi Amma is unwell. Ragini is on her way. Things are not the same as it was, when you left. I am not the same either. Mom... Mom, Dakini (witch)... Sorry, Ragini is here. We've lost everything. Our village was so peaceful. What did I do? The president is also here. How is she now? I looked after her so well. Do you see that? My mom was so proud of her village. You come with me. She will blame me for everything. Mother, can you please act normal? Else, she will kill me saying that I did not care for you. You are overdoing it, when asked to act normal. Do you plan to let him roam freely around? It's better that you take up some other job. Where's your courage now? Your guts! I have no clue as to what I should do. Chase them away from here, without letting anyone know. Only strong men can do that. Quotation! Hey, that won't do any good. I am suffering all this because I got a man for training us. That is why, I am suggesting. People here have high hopes on your sister. It's for her good. We have a meeting tomorrow. Shall I discuss... That's not needed. Let it be between the two of us. I will make all arrangements. Only men can take up certain tasks. Since ages, this village hasn't allowed a politician like me to step into his land. In the end, you had to come asking for my help, in times of need. There are so many girls in the village who are like Paru. For a liquor shop license, I came to the village Panchayat office several times. You didn't give me the permit. Did that help your village prosper? In a democratic country, understand that you cannot progress by having your own set of rules. Well, take a seat. Anyway, leave it to me. I cannot say no when Ragini has made the request. My boys will need only one night to deal with them. Nobody should know about this. You need not kill him. Just drive him away from the village. Like you said, within a night. Okay... Here you go. Let me know if you want more. Tomorrow is a very important day for Ponnapuram. It's the death anniversary of Ms Savitri, that's president's mom. No other day can be better than that. I'll take care. My boys will be there tomorrow. You carry on, see you later. Muruga, you may leave. You may stay here during the day. Once your job is done, leave immediately at night. Do you get that? What? - Well... I just told you. Bye, let me go. Babu... - Come. Yes, boss. - Get it. God, I just wish the night passes soon. It is not too safe to stay here for longer. Come on, sit. Kausalya, can't we dance too? The SI is here. How is the preparation going on? - Everything is ready. The women's dance with... I didn't see you going for a morning walk. President had called for an emergency meeting. Some urgent task! Hold this. What happened? - What more could've happened? Come aside, I will tell you. - What is it? What has happened? - Listen... I don't have the habit of lying. But let me tell you. President has given a quotation to drive Chandru and friends away. Oh, no! - God! - Three dangerous criminals. The very sight of them will scare anyone to death. - Oh! But the village council hasn't taken any such decision. That is what I don't understand. Don't tell her that I shared this with you. You don't share it with anyone else. I am a little busy. Constable, start the bike. Hiring goons is not... How could the president do that without our knowledge? How many goons did she tell you have come? You don't tell this to anyone. Sure, you can trust me on that. Hello, Ragini... Hold a second. Hello. No, I have no news. 'I am waiting.' I am waiting too. - 'Okay.' I'll call you. Did you kill him, or dump him in the river after cutting off his limbs? You... What rubbish are you talking? You need not hide it from me. You hired some goons and that's the talk of the town now. Can we women keep any secrets? You could have just told me. I would have cried or begged and sent him back. If anything happens to Chandru, you will see that I am dead too. Hello... Last night, a heinous attack was made at Ponnapuram Panchayat. The Panchayat office has been destroyed completely. The same night when 9th death anniversary of our revolutionary leader Ms Savitri Devi was going on, her statue was broken by antagonists last night. Last night around 12, all the men... Who could be such enemies? 'This attack that has shook the entire Ponnapuram village...' Leader... The president is here. This happened when our program was going on, last night. Madam, who do you think is behind this? - Get aside. Can I give you the byte? - That's not enough. Madam, please... Say something. Who do you think is behind this? People want to know the president's opinion. Ragini... Say something. Sit behind me. Let's go. You rocked, boss. Where are we going? You stay quiet. Here is who I was looking for. Both are here. What is the matter? Boss, it's in gear. - I have parked it. My darling, sweetheart... Well done! Here, shake hands with me. Bravo! I did not expect this. - Neither did I. He is pretending not to know anything. You thief! You destroyed the white house of the women here. You deserve a kiss from me. Kiss from me too. - You may wipe that off. Are they crazy? You took money, agreed for a job and are doing this here? This is not allowed here. It's cold out here. I was setting a bonfire. Just one night. That was the agreement. We've tolerated maximum as we can. It's about the survival of our village. He destroyed our Panchayat office. They did not destroy your office. I did it. Once, you and your sister were beaten up on the road like dogs. That too was my act. Who are you? Who are you? You wouldn't know me. Your mom is who I knew. In the liquor mishap that happened here years ago, I was the accused. Ayyappan's son, Bhairav! Your mom and few other women drove me and my mom away from this village. My dad rotted in jail when he died. None of your people considered the fact that my mom was a woman. Savitri, my foot! Since that day, I hate women. I was waiting. For this golden chance. I won't spare you. I won't spare a single woman in this village. This is why they say, women have no brains. Was there a need for all this? It's because she got instigated by Ragini. Ragini is now absconding. I won't spare her anyway. Someone has come here to seek revenge... He did not come here, we invited him. So, neither can I charge a case nor can I deal with him. This is not the end of it. You need to be more careful ahead. Physical abuse, humiliation, rape, and so on. Whatever bad can happen with a woman on earth, is going to happen here. The women's army won't be able to stop the disaster. That's the fate of Ponnapuram. Leader, looks like, it's going to rain heavily. You keep that here. Come quickly. The storms have names of girls like Rita, Katrina... Haven't you heard that? This is a male storm called Bhairavan! Women will die out of fear. This has never happened in our village. Leader, hope Bhairavan won't harm us in any way. We need not be afraid. As far as I know, those are beasts who only harm women. You keep those things inside. Kusumam, listen to me. And then you speak. First, her sister had a lover. And now, here's another man because she gave him a quotation. The one responsible for this village's doom is none but our President. If there's a no confidence motion, this is the right time to get her dismissed. If something like that happens, won't you stand by my side, Kusumam? Oh, it's a power cut. I'll call you later, there's a power failure. Let me close the window and go to sleep. Oh, no! Bhairavan! Listen, get up. What is it? - Bhairavan. Come on, get up. Bhairavan is out there. Where is he? - Over there. I don't see anyone there. - I saw him. He was right there. Are you out of your mind? Don't disturb my sleep. No, I saw him. God... - Was he really here? So what? Men have nothing to fear. Lambodara... Lambodara... I now feel that it's high time we plan a family. What did you say? You always told me this. We should have a child. So what about the Panchayat decision? Panchayat is going through troubled waters right now. That means, you have decided in my favor.. Yes. Why didn't you think of this earlier, Meenu? Listen... Honey... - What is it? Turn... - Ram... There's a boil on your body, down here. - What? You finally noticed it? Oh, no! Save me! Have you slept, honey? Yes. - You may hug me if you want to. You may do so first. It worked! Careful. What took you so long? I am exhausted. I was exhausted too, last night. What happened? You look very happy. It rained heavily and I am so relieved now, leader. Did that happen with you as well? - Yes. There are three more men who are relieved too. Look at how they're blushing. Shameless fellows! Those beasts are innocent. Shut up! How can I make tea if the gas stove is off? President, don't worry. The tension we faced till yesterday evening has vanished now. Why is that so? Nothing as such. President, you're responsible for this day. Does that mean, we'll surrender to men? So, didn't you surrender to him last night? Who, me? That's never going to happen. In the next meeting, I heard Gauri and friends are bringing up an opposition party. I see, did something like that happened amidst all these chaos? You'll switch loyalties when you get something you have never got. That's quite possible. So, what about my position? That looks a bit difficult. Very good. I never expected something like this within an overnight. Neither did we. Let those goons be around for some more days. We had a good time. - Right. No weed that grows after one rain, will grow too tall. I won't allow anyone in my party to enjoy that pleasure. Before any further notice, I dismiss you all from my party. Okay, then let me tell you something. We disperse the party. Come on. - Shanku, come on. "I will break the pot today..." Will you stop singing and come along? Kochu Keshava, you too? I'll take her home and be back. You just wait and see, I will rock even today. I'm scared now, Chandru. When I think that we're the root cause of all the problems... You were stubborn that you'd marry me only with the consent of all the villagers. I didn't understand the reason back then. But now, uniting this village folks is also my dream. But how? Now I feel, we shouldn't have done this. Will you be able to forget everything? Everything will be fine. I trust you more than I trust anyone else. What is it? You! Chandru! Chandru! You... Move! Chandru! No... Chandru... Paru... Thomacha, sir is here. How is he now? President, let me be very frank. We, women police cannot handle this alone. If I don't inform the higher officials, I'll lose my job.- Move! Excuse me, where are you barging into? - Who are you? What's wrong if I go in? This is a casualty ward. Not anyone can walk in and out. Such a sincere officer! You will be the next to be in the casualty. I'm Mohan Rajeev, the new Zonal ADGP. Go and call the doctor. Should I join? - Where's the doctor? Will we be in trouble? Hey, it's okay. Relax. Lie down. Sir... - Yes? Doctor, how is the situation? Anything serious? I've taken an X-ray, there are no serious fractures. But there are many wounds and skin bruises. I've administered injections so that it doesn't get septic. We're also giving them antibiotics. Check if there are any deep injuries. If you think a CT scan is needed, we will take them out. There's no persistent vomitting. Only if there are any symptoms is higher investigation needed. Okay. But make sure the two of them get proper treatment and good care. Okay? - Sure, sir. Hey! Don't worry, relax. What the hell are you doing? I was trying to come in... - What?! That's what you've been doing here since ages. Comedy! Yes, John? I think, they're in a critical condition. - No... I already reached. Things are in a mess here. Get ready for my order. I'll call back. I won't spare any of you. Be it a man or a woman! Quotation! Right? And that too, against the young boy who loves your younger sister. Do you know what's the punishment for this? IPC Section 120 B... Punishment for criminal conspiracy. And IPC section 110. Amendment of illegal act. You will have to spend the rest of your life behind the bars President, have you read the law book? Any girl or boy who is an adult has the right to make his independent decision and live. The right of choice of an adult in choosing a man to whom she gets married. Social values, parental love, moralities, everything is precious and should be respected. But much beyond all that is, the individual identity of a citizen. Freedom. These are not my words, but the Supreme Court has said it. He is knowledgeable. To be honest, tell me what is the problem of women here. Who are you opposing? Why are you opposing them? Making all men your enemies, and dancing on their chest! Is that what you call women liberation? Is it? Women have fought even before. But none of them were chaos to suppress or humiliate men. Without any feather or adornment of feminism, those were fights to progress. It is true that problems women face are really huge. But remember one thing. Such problems also affect the respectable men in that society. So, you blame the person, not the gender. Women should shout slogans, go on a strike and rule. They should do everything, but never against men. Stand with them. Yes. Yes. You come here. Come. Oh! You're the lion king that has grown old. In front of the villagers, you fought with your wife. What did you gain out of it? Weren't you a coward enough to make the other men a pawn? Pull your moustache up. And stand with your head held high. You create problems and bring disgrace to men. Unnecessary ego, complex, will do no good, be it to a man or a woman. Compromise and co-operation is the most important factor in a good man and woman relation. Two most beautiful creation on earth are, man and woman. One shouldn't rule the other. A man cannot do many things that a woman can. Similarly, a woman is not capable of doing everything that a man can. Both have their own flaws and qualities, limitations and plus points. Identify all that, love each other and respect each other. That's how we should live. Come on, answer it. Hello. President, I'm calling from Mukkutu Mala. There's a problem. Put it on speaker. Listen, there are many other goons with Bhairavan. They're about to start making adulterated liquor. President, things are going out of your control. They are many in numbers. This is a route kids pass by. We need to do something immediately, President. Light the stove. Why are you quiet, madam? Hey, we have no time to think All of you together, take some step immediately. President, hello... What are you so afraid of? If you become one, the village will stand united. If your village gets together, nobody can defeat you ever. Not even Bhairavan! All of you got together. Weren't you telling me this won't sell? So many people are here, serve it to all. But no credit. I need cash, on the spot. Your father could not do this. So, who are you? You! Did you see that? It is the women folk and not men in this village whose blood boils. Kick them all out! Dear... - You! Hey, beat them all up. No! - This side. - Hit him! You get aside. No Oh, no! Move! You... Wait. Stay right here. Sir, if you order... Let us not interfere now. What do you say now? Take him! Take them all Move! Things have ended well here. Yes. So then come home as soon as possible, with your girl. Mom is waiting back there. He is my dad. Dad?! I am also his dad. Everyone here is working. Hold this. Go and work. What can I do if they want to leave? Give it to dad. Have it.
