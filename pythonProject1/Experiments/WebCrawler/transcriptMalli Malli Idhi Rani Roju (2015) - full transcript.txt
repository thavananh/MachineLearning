foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food --- Distance feels closer to me but the dear ones seem to be far away. Because I'm a runner. Hello, sir! - Hello, sir.. How do you feel when you win? We feel like winning again and again. Make friends with victory. It will always stay with you. Love a failure it always leads to victory. How many times have you broken the record? Five.. - Five times, sir. Five times, sir. How many times have you won the 100 meters and 500 meters race? I have won the 100 meters thrice. Tell my driver to reverse the car. - Okay, sir. Come here once. I don't give suggestions to anyone but I would like to suggest to you. Run for your victory and not for other's failure. The one who wants to make the others lose is always the one who's left behind. The one who wants victory will always stand first and will win. Winning doesn't mean making others lose. Have you understood? - Yes. All the best! - Thank you, sir! Hello, friends. You have enjoyed your favourite songs till now. But now you are going to listen to my favourite song which all of you will definitely like. This is RJ Parvathi signing off. You are listening to Radio Mirchi 98.3 FM. It's hot. "The one who stole my heart.." "The one who stole my heart.." Bye, Pallavi. - Why are you running like that? I have to get home before my dad reaches. Okay, bye. Sir, you are Raja Ram, right? - Yes. Will you run with me? How many members would you like to run with? Sir, we are already in that process. Don't come back. If possible, get your parents along with you. "Oh, Lord with the elephant face.." "Oh, Lord Ganesha, there is a glow of wealth on your face." "You are the son of Goddess Parvathi and are greeted by all." Hey, teacher. - Hey. What is in your mouth? - Thyaga Laya Keerthana. Hey, it's not Thyaga Laya Keerthana. It's Thyagaraja Keerthana. It's spilling. Clean that. Your mouth is too full to sing. "He is the Lord of the sky high mountains." Are you all practicing well? - Yes. Dad. - Yes. What do you want me to prepare for lunch? I'm so happy today, dear. I'm not feeling hungry. What does happiness have to do with hunger? The same thing that your bike has with the traffic signal. No one ever cares about the other. Not only the songs but even the things you say on the radio are good. No need to work secretly. Sorry, Dad. I thought you may not be happy about it. Even if my daughter doesn't tell me, the radio does, dear. Hey, Hankie. Your heart is not here, right? Sorry. Hey, shouldn't you thank us? Your heart might have got dusty if we hadn't reminded you. Thanks! - Your mind is not here, right? I'm in a stadium. Robin, he reminds me of myself. Do you know something? - What is that? I want to send you to him. - Really? Do you want to? Please don't send us far away. We beg you. We beg you. Don't be foolish. He is amazing. He has broken his own record five times. Do you remember your own records? You are forgetting everything. Even our love. Hey, if you stay with me, what will you get? If I send you to him, it will be useful. Ram, what are you saying? Are we not human? We wear leather and we have great figures as well. Love doesn't mean staying together. The distance will feel a lot closer. Yes. You are totally in love with distance. You are a runner. You won't be a winner even if you win the race. You are always a runner. You won't be a winner even if you win. You'll always be a runner. You won't be a winner even if you win. You'll always be a runner. 'A few years ago, during the college days.' What are you doing, dear? The sky looks blue but it has all the colours in it. It looks like a beautiful painting even if we don't understand it. If you love the sky, you won't get anything. If you love a girl, you will find beautiful paintings. What is there in girls? When you fall in love, you will know. I'm already in love. - With whom? With my running. - Cousin. Wait, dear. I'm also coming. Dear, I can't run along with you. Please stop. He brought me here again. What are they saying today? They are giving me flying kisses. Giving flying kisses. Ask them for a chance with me. - We will slap you, idiot. They want to slap you with a slipper. Is that it? So do shoes wear slippers? Try them once. Even shoes would wear slippers. Dear, there is a famous asylum. We should go there. What is this? You love the sky and you flirt with shoes. You say that you love running. I'm worried about you. Hey! I want to run in those spiked shoes and touch the sky. State level, national level and then Olympics. Truly something has happened to you. Move. - We have to take an appointment. Do you have Rs. 6 to drink tea? No. - Do you know how much that shoes cost? Rs. 6,000. We should know our limits, dear. This painting is awesome. Excuse me. I think the skirt should be little bit shorter. Then come to the shop with me. Idiot. - God! She is like a roadside vendor. Even if you don't have a penny, you can flirt with a girl. Then can't I concentrate on my goal? Goal looks better than a girl. "The beautiful women, Yashoda." "Yashoda." "He is her son." "He is her son." "With fortune.." "With fortune.." "He is her son." "He is her son." That's enough for today. Okay, teacher. Bye. - Bye. Dear, Sravani. - Teacher. Have you remembered? - I'll get it tomorrow, teacher. Don't forget. It's already the tenth of this month. Okay, teacher. Eat. I'm not hungry. I'm sad. Why don't you feel hungry whenever you are happy or sad? What happened? Do you know how beautiful you were as a child? Look now, your photograph got spoilt. Mom is getting old because of me. - It's because of me. What have you done? You are providing food and I'm eating it. I don't want it. - Don't do that. Have it. - No, Mom. Then I too won't eat. What happened to you now? You only say that we don't feel hungry when we are happy or sad. Isn't it sad? Have this. After feeding a child the mother feels hungry. You have that, dear. I'll look for a job, Mom. What about your studies? Running is my education. If you don't have an education, running will never help you. What, Mom? I want to do something for you. Do one thing, your father took away my nuptial chain. You bring me a gold medal in the national championship. Run and get it. Will you bring that? Ram. Come on, wear these spikes. - I will run barefoot, sir. I don't want these spikes. - Listen to me, that is not safe. I have my spikes. - Then wear them. I haven't bought them yet. They are in the showroom. Hey, why are you laughing? Hey, Ram. Why are you staring at that girl? You cannot buy them. I have a feeling. It can't be bought. Once I have it, I won't let it go. Ram, listen to me and wear them. We are getting late. Wear them fast. What are these? I don't like them. - Hey, Ram players have come from all the universities, please listen to me. The competition is going to be tough. Damn it! All participants, get ready for the race. On your mark. Come on, Ram. Concentrate. Get set. Come on, Ram. Hey, give it to him. - Okay. I should have spikes. You ran so fast without shoes. What is this? She asked me to give this to you. Hey, what is your name? What does that mean? Look, your legs are hurt. You could have run with shoes. I don't feel any pain, Mom. Dumb fellow. Win once, then you will know. I do know. How? Have you won any time? When I gave birth to you. It was hell till you were born. I was dying, but when I saw you I forgot all my pains. What else does victory mean? Mom. You said that you wanted this. Take this. It's for you. I know that my son brought this for me. But I have asked for a national medal. Mom, why do you prepare ordinary rice pudding every time? Why don't you put some almonds in it? When you bring a national medal, I'll put some almonds in it. Okay? Have it. Mom. - Yes. Today, I saw a Muslim girl. Her eyes were like the traffic signal. I stopped to stare at her. You stopped for a girl! What? They were beautiful, that's it. Everyone shook hands with me but only she saw the pain in my leg. Are you in love with her? Go, Mom. I just felt that way. Why did he run so fast? Wasn't he in pain? - That's why he won. Is Raja Ram a Hindu? Ram is a Hindu. Yes, it's true. I think he has a good heart. I haven't seen it. Do you want to see it? Why would I want to? He cried for shoes like a child. Oh, every girl in college looks at him but he never notices them. Is that true? You also never look at boys, right? So you won't know. Why hasn't he bought shoes? Poor boy! Doesn't he have money? What does his father do? - Not father, his mother. She is a music teacher. She is Parvathamma. "Oh, Lord Ganesha, I pray to you." "Oh, Lord Ganesha, I pray to you." "Greetings to the Lord who is worshipped by the great saints." "Oh, Lord Ganesha, I pray to you." "Oh, Lord Ganesha, I pray to you." "Oh, Lord.." Greetings. - Greetings. "Oh, Lord Ganesha, I pray to you." "Oh, Lord Ganesha, I pray to you." "Oh, Lord.." - Could you stop? Who are you, dear? I want to learn music from you. - Sit down. What is your name? Khannam. - Why did you take that long? I thought you might refuse because I'm a Muslim. It's okay. Songs need heart, not religion. Do you want to sing? Sing. I'll listen to your voice with my heart. "This is a session of God." "Your music is our treasure." "Your word is a gift to us." "Hear our prayers and bless us." "Bless us, my Goddess!" "How one speaks, is the treasure of Indian tradition." "This is the humanity's first rule, taught by all the saints." "Love is the beautiful picture of life." "It's the representation of world." "It's a winsome poetry. It's a mesmerising dance." "It's the source of happiness and rhythm of life." "It's the soul of all life forms." "It's a beautiful, mellifluent and divine tune." "Every voice echoes." "This is a blessing." "The rhythm in every heart is the same." "Being together.." "Song becomes a holy book." "It's true that your love is true." "It can't have a price." "That is true." "The meaning of true love is.. Haven't you understood your heart?" "If you have, you will know" "that love is everything." "Your love is true." "It's priceless." "It is pure. That is real love." "Haven't you understood?" "When you understand that, you will feel like it's everything." "The world is so confusing." "No one can understand it." "You are my dream." "I can never refuse." "Our hearts will fly along with the music." "If I'm a statue, you can melt me with music." "How one speaks, is the treasure of Indian tradition." "This is the one which is running the world." "Beautiful Yashoda's son." "He is the cute son." "She is fortunate to have him." "He is the son of a Goddess." "Beautiful Yashoda's son." - Ram. - Yes. "She is fortunate to have him." "He is the son of a Goddess." You sang so well. - Will you join me? You have already joined us. Then from tomorrow onwards, I will come in the evening. I have college. What is this? I'm not here to sell my passion. Jyothi. - What? Your bike is great, will you give it to me once? I've heard that you don't know how to drive. I have a license. Srinu has it. If he gives it to you, take it. Idiot. My dear, stop. Girls are so fast. Hey. Have you ever seen a girl's eyes? Most men never look at their eyes, dear. That means if they are okay, they look at their eyes. You will never change. Move. We have to find a girl. What is this? I can't believe that you are searching for a girl. Right. I can't believe it too. A girl can be so beautiful. She is a Muslim girl. She is like a beautiful flower. She is like a beautiful flower. I died after looking into her eyes. Then I learnt that death also gives life. That death is called love. You are in love. - Nothing like that. It would be nice if I am in love. You definitely are. Why are all the rooms empty? - I don't know. Don't we have classes? Ram, come here. - Sir. Greetings. Sit. Dear friends he is our state athletic champion, Raja Ram. Now our principal is going to present an award to Raja Ram. Congratulations. - Thank you, sir. In our college the one who teaches has a voice. But for a PT teacher like me I just have a whistle to blow. Not only salary some people feel we don't even deserve respect. You sit in class rooms we stay on the ground. Never underestimate us. In your classroom, you have fans, tables chairs and boards. But on a playground, we have only one thing that is the National Flag. The National Flag. I was worried that I might retire without saying this. When I counted my salary every month, I felt so bad. But my student Raja Ram, made me a winner. He gave me a voice. That's enough for me. Hail Raja Ram. Hail Raja Ram. Hail Raja Ram. Dear. Raja Ram. Yes, sir. - I need an autograph. Everyone has a signature but not everyone can give an autograph. Whoever opens an account with Rs. 100 can sign on a cheque. Even the one who has Rs. 100 crore, can't give an autograph. This is the first time. If you look at it and sign your hand will quiver. Close your eyes and do it. This is my first autograph. I will never forget it. Thank you. - You should thank her, not me. She asked me to do it. Don't you need an autograph? Hello! Hello, stop! I'm calling you. You are running really fast, join me. Hey. Hey. Stop. Hello! Hey, stop. Don't you need an autograph? Hey, you had asked for my autograph so take it. Come. Let me give you my autograph. Where are you? It's not fair. Hello! Where are you? Where are you? Hey! Do you know, my autograph means my heart? If I give it to you, you should take it. What? That is.. What? Is it love? Nothing like that. I want to see her. I want to speak to her. That's it, sir. If it is love, tell me. I'll talk to her. Okay. I want him to come after me. I want him to look for me. I want to hide. I want to be caught. Is this love? I feel silly. You met him a little while ago. You look so calm but you are really fast. Is there any rule which states that to be in love we have to wait for few days? No one falls in love just like that. When did you get to know about all these? When I saw him. - Then go and tell him. Why are you hiding your feelings? It's good. Let it be. Now these feelings make us think that we're in love. After a few years we won't have all this. Then we'll have to love our memories. If we have many lives, it'll be fine, right? Nazeera, you are Muslim and they are Hindus. Isn't it wrong? - In every religion people falls in love in the same way. Ram, your choice is great. Made for each other. Everyone speaks about us but there is no one to join us. Hey, don't speak like that. Apologize to him. We don't apologise. Tell him to treat us and we will thank him. He will treat you, but he should have money, right? Hey, he got his salary. He has it in his pocket. - Is it? Are they speaking to you? - They are scolding you as well. They are angry with you because you didn't treat them. You have taken the salary, but you aren't using it to buy them. Did spikes say that to you? - Yes. You ask them. Me? Hey, Raja. I have all my hopes pinned on you. If you become like this, what would I do? How much do they cost? Come, I'll buy them for you. Come on. - Is that real? - Yes. "Seven steps of togetherness." "It's a long lasting relation." You don't get these types of shoes anywhere. These are perfectly designed spikes. Very light weight. A foreigner specially designed this for him. But he didn't come for this yet. It has been one year. These have been bought. Pack them. How much? - Just Rs. 6,000. Rs. 6,000! - Yes. Sorry, Ram. Hello, sir? - Yes, Mr. Ismail. It's been so long. How are you? - I'm good. Are you fine? - I'm good. Thank you. - Almond milk. Take it, sir. Raja, drink the almond milk. You will run fast. Mr. Ismail, come here. He is my student, Raja Ram. In the State Athletics meet, 100 meters category he won a gold medal. I trained him. It was published in the newspaper too. See. 'State running champion, Raja Ram.' What a man you are! I don't think he the one in the photograph here. He is the one. They printed a small photograph. When he wins at the national level, read the newspaper. His news will fill the newspaper. Whatever. You brought someone the last time as well. You said that he would do something great and you bought him suit and shoes. But he hasn't won anything. - Mr. Ismail. He bought that with his own money. - Leave it, sir! Raja, after all the cut offs my salary is Rs. 3,300. Rent is Rs. 1,000. Rs. 1,000 for instalments. Rs. 1,000 for grocery. Rs. 1,000 for small expenditures. I run my house with a deficit of Rs. 700. If I use my salary to buy the spikes.. Sir, I have legs even if I don't have spikes. I can run. Sorry, sir. I'll manage. - Sir. Keep this Rs. 1,000 and buy it. - Sir. Don't get into trouble, sir. Keep this with you. Please, sir. - I'll hit you. I'm your coach. I don't need your pity. Win another gold medal, that's it. Mr. Ismail, he will come daily. Give him almond milk and note it down in my account. You're like my family, it won't be noted. Hey, Ram. This shop is yours. Ram. That is enough. Come inside. - What? It's raining, come on. Come. What, Mom? - Why are you playing in the rain? I'm feeling very happy today, Mom. It's okay. Come inside. Today is mine. Raja Ram's day. - Okay, come inside. Why are you so happy today? Mom. - Yes. I was felicitated in college today. Sir gave me Rs. 1,000 to buy spikes. Then I gave my first autograph. - Oh! Do you know to whom? To the girl with the beautiful eyes I told you about. Oh, this is too much. - Mom! Nothing like that, Mom. I gave her because she asked me. That's it. The one with the beautiful eyes? Those eyes? They speak so much. They talk to me. They question me. They scold me. They even hit me. Those are devilish eyes. Hey, tell me the truth. Do you love her? No, Mom. Then fall in love, it will be beautiful. Mom. You are spoiling the children. People who are not loved are the most damaged ones. We enjoy seeing our children happy. A Muslim girl comes to my class to learn music. Learn Urdu from her. Teacher. She is here. What, dear? - Teacher. Can you teach my son Urdu? Ram, change your clothes. Go. Don't mind, dear. He is in his dream world. Come. Is he handsome without the dress? Why do you want to know that? What's in it for me? I asked for you. Your hand is too hard. You eat a lot of mutton. Later he will cook biryani for you. Yes. I will cook biryani. He will cook 'Pulihora'. We will mix both and eat. Do you want? I don't need that 'Mutton Pulihora'. You only have that. Have you taught him your language? He asked me something. I told him that. - What is that? I didn't know that eyes speak till your eyes spoke to me. I feel something in my heart. I had never felt that till I saw you. I don't know how to live this life because you have taken it. I love you. Hello! How do I say this in Urdu? Now you and me.. Not you. I'm talking about my short story. This script is for that. - Short story? Yes. - Are you talking about my height? What about your height? But you said that it is a short story. You called me, right? Why would I call you? These words are for someone from my college. For that I have to tell him what he wants me to tell. I feel like it's coming out of me. Did you tell him? I told him something else. So sad! What is there? He will anyway say that to me, right? Let him. Even if it has a different meaning, it will feel good. "Oh, my love, you don't know" "that you're still very beautiful and I am very young." "I give my life to you. Oh, my love.." Hey, Ram. Why are you laughing at yourself? Nothing, sir. I have written my feelings in Urdu. Something like a haiku. Really? - Yes. Do you know our language? I'm learning, sir. - Hey, Ram! Tell me the truth. Aren't you in love with a Muslim girl, right? Why? Is that wrong? - No, sir. A wife is the owner of a house. If a girl of my religion becomes the head of your house we will feel happy. Marry her. But I have a doubt. If a girl from your religion marries a boy of our religion will you approve? Mr. Ismail, if a girl is born to us I'll make her the head of your house. Okay? - Hey! Good. Tell that haiku. 'You are a bad girl.' 'I want to hurt you.' 'I want to see you crying.' 'I cry after I meet you.' 'If you like my madness..' 'If you love my wickedness' 'come, let us love each other.' How is it, Mr. Ismail? I want to hurt you. I want to impair you. I want to see you cry. I want to cry along with you. If you like my madness if you believe in my stupidity then come, let us fall in love. What is this? Is it? - Yes. You feel that his love is madness. If it is not that, it can't be called love, right? What will you do if he proposes you? I'll laugh and will make him cry. It's sadism. Love may be a part of it. If we cry, it's hard. If someone cries for us, it's called love. Hello! Hey, he's here. I want to speak with you. I didn't know one could understand silence until I understood the silence of your eyes. I didn't know that disturbance was needed until I got disturbed by you. I didn't know that we can live without a life. You have taken my life but I'm still alive. What do you say? When do you say? I'll be waiting for you. I won't leave you. Teacher. Teacher. Teacher, you are here! I looked all over the house for you. What are you doing here? Did he say? Did he say? Why did you do that? - Just for fun. Why do you want to make fun of him? Shall I apologise to him? What will he do with your apology? He is waiting for the love of a girl. We took your help for that and this is what you've done! Is it? - Yes. Oh, no! This is why, we should not hide our ailments from a doctor and details from a teacher. Even then love is the same in all languages. She might have got that. Tell me the truth, Khannam. You might have a love story as well. Is he from the same religion? - Where is your son? If he likes something he will never leave it. It's the spikes this time. They cost Rs. 6,000. He wants to buy them. He has gone to sell all the medals that he had won so far. He loves his spikes the same way he loves a girl. Not only medals, he may give up his life. Ram, please save us. Sir, please. Don't give him those spikes. Hey, fatty. We won't fit you. Please leave us. Leave us. - Those are mine, sir. Sir, keep Rs. 1,000 and the medals, and give me the shoes. Please, sir. Do you find Sholapur in Sholapur slippers? There isn't any gold in these gold medals. This is all rubbish. I'm not selling these medals. I'm just lending these to you. I'll take them back when I have money. I haven't seen anyone like you. Sir, I have to practice for nationals. What can I do for that? These medals are not enough. Sir, this is my success. These are my life. No one can live your life other than you. There is no cost for that. Go. Take them and go. Go. - Sir, these spikes don't fit me. Sir, think about it. - Ram. Sir. - One minute. What? Take this Rs. 6,000 and buy the spikes. You.. - She gave it, not me. Take it. She can give it, right? Nazeera, he wants you to give it. I don't take money from unknown people. I want to see you. I don't need this. Will you take it from me? - No. She should give me but I should see her. You don't need to mortgage your medals, just take the money. Your eyes have a voice. Don't they? Just open up. Hey, what have I done? Why don't you reply? She bought your spikes, Ram. That means she gave me her heart, right? Both are the same. Ram. - Yes. She is waiting for you. She wants to speak with you. Where is she? She didn't say. She wants you to find her. Hey, tell me where she is. What is this? If you are waiting for me, do I have to look for you? Oh! Love means to look for the one you love. I think of you every now and then. But you are always in my heart. Do you want to say something? Tell me. I'm waiting to hear from you. What is it? That you love me? You could have said it. You are selected for nationals. I know that you will achieve it. I can say proudly that the national champion, Raja Ram is my student. No doubt, victory will be at your feet. Run, just do it. Thanks. Nazeera from the time I have seen you, I have been running after you. I have been winning. You have taken my first autograph. You bought me the spikes. You informed me that I've been selected for nationals. I see you at every turn in the race. I want to see not your beauty but my reflection in your eyes and your reflection in mine. I want to see you. Hey, stop. I'm unable to see. This is cheating. Hey, you should not play hide-and-seek. I want to see you. I won't leave you. 'Visakhapatnam.' Hey, I have packed everything. You need not buy anything there. Don't eat anything that might spoil your health. While returning from Delhi, I asked you to bring something. Do you remember? Yes, Mom. I remember. - Tell me, what is that? Gold medal, right? I'll bring it. You should! Now I've understood, why he has been winning. Nobody forgets what their mothers ask for. Hey, I didn't say anything to you. That's your field, your race and your life. Don't hand it to someone else. Chase success. All the best, dear. - Thanks. Hey, take care of mom. - Okay. - You also take care, dear. - Okay. Are you waiting for Nazeera? I know. Following you is my work. The one who loves you will come to bid farewell. But the one who loves your success would only come to welcome you. Not just one, but hundreds will come. All the best. Don't forget to take your medicines. - Take this. Sir, no. I don't want it. Keep them. Nazeera or Khannam? Nazeera Khannam. "Oh, my beloved.." "Oh, my beloved." "Oh, my beloved." "Oh, my beloved.." "Oh, my beloved." "The eyes are glowing like a rainbow." "My girl's face is like a moon peeking out of a cloud." "You are like the life" "in my heart."

"You are fragrance of the flower." "Oh, my beloved.." "Oh, my beloved.." 'National games, New Delhi.' Teacher. I'm unable to tie it. - Use the chair. I'm doing all the work. Why are you not helping me? Do you want a girl from our religion? Would you do this with that girl? If you don't wait for him like that, won't your son come? I'm not waiting for him, dear. I'm waiting for almond rice pudding. I had told him that if he won the national medal I would prepare almond rice pudding for him. But I don't know how to prepare it. So my neighbour is coming to help me. Don't worry. I know how to prepare almond rice pudding. Do you know? - Very well. Come. Teacher. - Yes. Why do you want another girl? Why don't you get me married to your son? Finish it. He'll reach here soon. Teacher, when Ram comes, he'll tell you something. I want to see how you feel. Nazeera, work properly. Nazeera Khannam. Do you think I don't know that? He said, 'Mom, I gave the medals to the shop keeper' 'and asked for the shoes.' 'But he refused.' 'Then Nazeera came all of a sudden.' 'She took the medals and bought me the shoes.' 'But how did she know?' 'I hadn't told anyone other than you.' He doesn't know. When he wanted to learn your language you taught him. You said that he was mad and crazy. I had a doubt, but those shoes confirmed everything. Hey, where are you going? Stay. When he comes back and gives me the medal I will give my daughter-in-law to him. Look at those eyes. They are like two gold medals. That is why, he is running after you. Long live Raja Ram.. Long live Raja Ram.. Long live Raja Ram.. Long live Raja Ram.. Long live Raja Ram.. - Long live Raja Ram. - Hey. It is enough. Let him down. - Long live Ram.. - Come, dear. Come. Slowly. Get rid of all the evil eyes. Where is my medal, dear? This is for my mother. We can get it only in Delhi. Where is my almond rice pudding? It's in your room. Is that in room? Go. Is that Nazeera? Or Khannam? Or Nazeera Khannam? My mom's almond rice pudding. Is that you? Nazeera, your uncle is calling you. Hey! Hey, when will I see you again? When? One o'clock? Where? What are you doing here? Come, let us go home. Nazeera will come here. - Now come with me. You go, I'll come. Come. - Hey! If she doesn't come, it will be her mistake. If I don't wait till she comes, it'll be my mistake. You go, I'll come. Mom is calling you, she wants to go out with you. She is a mother, she will understand. Ask her to wait. Girls can't wait for long. Hey! Your mom is dead. 'Mother.' Your dad took away my nuptial chain but you should bring me a gold medal. I'll wear that. Cool, Ram. Take it easy. One's life looks easy for others but everyone's life is so hard for themselves. You can't understand that pain. In my life, I have three love stories. I love mom. I love running. I love a girl. But only running is left. Mom and the girl have left me at such a time when success and failure are prevalent in my life. Sorry, Ram. We really don't understand because we never left each other. We don't even know how it feels. Don't worry, Ram. You are always a winner to us. I'm a winner to all but a runner to me. What happened to Nazeera? Where is she now? For me she is in this letter. Ma'am. Ma'am, everyone is waiting for you. - Okay. Hello, ma'am. Good evening, everyone. The quarterly financial success of Nazeera group of Industries, is not mine alone. It is all of yours, my team. So I thank you. And the party is not over yet. You all have your bonuses coming. So enjoy your evening and I'll see you all tomorrow at work. Mehak. Coffee. Coffee. My head is aching, someone give me a coffee. Mehak. Mom, why you? Mom, what is this? I want coffee. It is a hangover. This works better than coffee. Drink it. It's hard to drink, Mom. You have enjoyed all night is that not enough? Who is this? My BF - BF? What do you mean by BF? What are you thinking? Boyfriend. - Oh! Who is he? You shouldn't spy on your daughter. You shouldn't spy on your daughter. No daughter's life should be like this. And I care about you, Mehak. I'm concerned. I'm not spying. This is John, my ex-boyfriend. What's wrong with it? Why did he become an 'ex'? We didn't connected with each other. Then how could he be a boyfriend? Mom, can we be friends? Shall we talk like friends? Mom, what is this? I want coffee. It is a hangover. This works better than coffee. Drink it. It's hard to drink, Mom. You have enjoyed all night is that not enough? Who is this? My BF - BF? What do you mean by BF? What are you thinking? Boyfriend. - Oh! Who is he? You shouldn't spy on your daughter. You shouldn't spy on your daughter. No daughter's life should be like this. And I care about you, Mehak. I'm concerned. I'm not spying. This is John, my ex-boyfriend. What's wrong with it? Why did he become an 'ex'? We didn't connected with each other. Then how could he be a boyfriend? Mom, can we be friends? Shall we talk like friends? To become a boyfriend, he should have a good physique. But to continue that, there should be some chemistry. That didn't happen. So we broke up. Broke up? What about the present one? - He is Sameer. He is a smart guy. How is the chemistry? It's new now. Everything new becomes old someday. So will you keep breaking up and have new boyfriends like this? Do we have to compromise if we don't connect? Bullshit! We are going to India. You are doing your medicine there. India! Why? Don't we have medical colleges here? You can find the one who can love your bullshit only in India. You should know about love. Come on, Mom. Love is the same everywhere. Love is like Coulomb's law. It's an attraction between positive and negative. That's it. It's all about that. That is a stupid thing. It's not sex. - Then what is it, Mom? Sex is an ultimate expression of love. It's divine. Something that a woman and a man can't express to each other is called sex. It happens only with the one whom you love. Nothing more can be expressed about love. If you really fall in love, you will know. Here you are falling in Coulomb's love. Stay in India, you will fall in love. Does that mean we won't find any broken relationships in India? If we follow the same culture there, you will. If you follow that culture, you won't find them anywhere. Then how do you have? Raj Ram is your ex-boyfriend. He is not my ex-boyfriend. He was never my boyfriend. He is my life and I'm his autograph. If your love was that great, you wouldn't be here today. You wouldn't have been my mother. Nazeera, your uncle is calling you. That call changed my life. Uncle, why did you call me? Are you going somewhere? - We are going to Malaysia now. I have important classes. I have exams next month. I can't come. We have to go immediately. Aunt, what happened? Your father met with an accident. - Accident? How? When? How is he now? Is he fine? We are getting late for the flight. Please get ready. Hello. Can you call Raja Ram? I'm Nazeera here. Call back in five minutes, I'll inform him. Nazeera, we are getting late. Please come, my dear. Stop! - Dear, please.. If we stop now, we will miss the flight and your father. Please cool down. Nazeera, are you all right? - Where is dad? He is inside. Come when you please. - No.. We will be there on time. Don't wait for us. - Thank you, sir. Yes, I understand. Oh, this is my daughter, Nazeera Khannam. Hello, dear! - She is studying in India. We will meet again. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Come, my dear. How are you? What happened? You are looking sick. Aren't you eating anything in India? Forget it. Tell me what do you want to drink, tea or coffee? My father knows to lie. Lie? You won't like it, if I cry, right? Hey. - Why did you make me cry? - Hey. What did your uncle say to you? He said that you met with an accident. - Accident? Can't you see me in full shape? I'm hale and hearty. Leave that. How is India? It's okay. However it is good to live there. That's a good feeling. Studies? Interesting. - Friends? Interesting. Raja Ram. Interesting? When even uncle also doesn't know how do you know? - I know. I'm your dad, right? Do you like him? Anyone would like him. Even you. What if I don't like him? Or if he doesn't like you can I leave you for that? It is love. - Nazeera. She got your ability to love and your stubbornness. Have you seen your mother, Nazeera? There is no love. Can't you forget him for my sake? It's difficult. I want you to endure pain once in your life. Try it. Is that for dad or for religion? For respect. Nazeera, everyone in India has integrity and unity. There may be one who thinks there is no unity. But there is no one who doesn't follow it. I'm also an Indian. I came here as a migrant, as a labourer. Today I'm Sultan Fazal Hussain. My property is worth a billion ringgits. I came to this position not because I have a good heart but because of my religion. Now I'm responsible for the society around me. Nazeera, you know the Ramayana, right? Ram and Sita went to live in the forest not because of disbelief but as a representative of that society. That was his responsibility. Nazeera, I'm asking you to leave the one you love. That's it. Dad, since my childhood you never said 'no' to me. You accepted me even when I made mistakes. That's why I stopped making mistakes. Now you yourself are asking me to make a mistake. When I wanted to study in India you should have refused. I would have accepted it. How can you do this, Dad? Dad, if you get me married to the one whom you like another person will live in my heart for my entire life. Are you okay with that? No, dear. I'm ashamed of living in this society. Forget it. I'll take care of myself. Do what you feel is right. Be happy. That's it. I love you. Nazeera, how can you speak like this to your father? Go and apologise to him. Dad is okay with that. Do you think it is wrong? Dear, you don't know about my brother. He says that, but he takes stern decisions. What are you trying to say? Do you want me to accept it? Don't you think my likes are different? Dad. - Brother. 'A few days later.' We can leave after two days. There are certain formalities to shift the properties to India. We shouldn't come here again. After going there, I'll speak to his mother. Everything will be done as per your wish. I wish you happiness. Does Raja Ram know that we are coming? Mom give me a notepad and a pen. I have never cared about financial matters. I had never allowed him to discuss it with me. I hadn't thought about a day like this. Your uncle and aunt stay here. They don't want to stay in India. They just came because you were studying there. Anyway, we are done here. Let us leave. Mom give this letter to uncle. Mustaffa. - You also read it. It's a mistake. One should not read other's letters. But mother should read her children's letters. She has to correct them. 'To Ram, from Nazeera.' 'My dad gave me everything.' 'I have to give something to him.' 'That is why, I want to give him our love.' 'There is nothing more valuable than this.' 'Sorry.' 'By the time you read this letter, I'll be married to someone else.' 'Forget about me.' 'There will be a girl for you, marry her.' 'This is not a hard task' 'because you have known me only for some time.' 'I was close to you, but not anymore.' 'Nazeera.' What is this? - When uncle goes to get aunt from India send it with him and ask him to give it to Ram. None of my details should be known to him. But why? I'm not saying no to the one who is not here. If dad was here and had disapproved I couldn't have accepted it. But he left us. We may not consider our life but we should respect death. Otherwise, I can't be his daughter. If this marriage takes place I will remember dad whenever I stay with him. I won't be able to bear that. I can leave the one I love to live with dad but I can't leave dad. Leave it. Okay, I'll find another match for you. How? I'm already married to Ram. As far as I know when you love each other, you should get married. We are already in love so even if we don't get married, there will be no change. He is my husband. I can't forget dad and live with Ram. I can't forget Ram and live with someone else. Leave it. It's not like that, Nazeera. - Mom. I'm more stubborn than dad. I left the one I love. It's not hard to give up on life. After all, it's a life of love. It is smaller than love. Remember that. "Past.." "how can I leave you?" "Life is too hard." "Where can it lead me?" "I can't breathe." "I'm left this way." "I'm going where I'm not supposed to." "I'm a moving statue." "Past.." "how can I leave you?" "It's like summer" "in a desert." "Memories" "are only sweeping away my tears." "I've turned to live" "in the darkness." "Time will answer." "Past.." "How can I leave you?" "My life is too hard." "Where can it lead me?" "I'm unable to breathe." - I'll be waiting for you. "I'll be waiting for you, - I won't leave you." "I'm left this way." "I'm moving in an unmanageable road." "I'm moving like a statue." When I thought I would remain alone I got a responsibility. But I didn't know it would turn into a relationship. Who? What happened? I didn't understand no matter how much I tried. Birth brings joy but some are born with dislike. God gives something when he takes something away. He took everything from me and made me a mother. Love, family and marriage, should give us a happy life. We should leave anything that makes us sad. If you thought like that, you could have had a family. Why do you give importance to sorrow, Mom? In hard times, sorrow is the only thing that stays with us, Mehak. That is called love. - I love my car. If I lose it, I'll feel pain. If I cry for it, you'll call it love. For me, that is foolishness. Swipe your credit card and buy a new car. Then you can forget the old one. Even if it is a boyfriend or husband, the same formula works. If it is lost, get a new one or else exchange it. That's life. We can't purchase feelings. Once you fall in love with someone, it's forever. You haven't fallen in love that is why you don't know. - Oh! So even Raja Ram would wait and not get married like you. Even if he does get married, he will be like me. There may be another girl in his life but I'm the only one in his heart. That is also wrong, right? Then why don't you commit that mistake? There should be a man in your life, too. Shut up. I cheated him. I lied to him about my marriage. Even the woman he's married to, shouldn't find out. To forget me, he may get married. I wrote that letter for that purpose. Then how can you love a married man? That is also wrong, isn't it? It's wrong. It's definitely wrong. To fall in love and to forget is not in our hands, Mehak. If we don't get married to the one whom we love mistakes do happen. That is why those who love each other should get married. Cool, Mom. You are just thinking like that. Love is not such a great thing, to think about mistakes. He would have forgotten you long ago. They are men, Mom. They'll forget. Time makes us forget everything. You could have forgotten, but you haven't even tried. One second is enough to fall in love but to kill it it takes more than a life time. My Ram will never forget me. You'll have to introduce yourself to him if he sees you now. I'm so and so. You fell in love with me when you looked into my eyes. I had come to learn music at your home. Like this. Ram can find me, no matter how far I may be. He will forget about his marriage and hug me. Then shall we bet? A serious bet. We will go to India and meet Raja Ram. If he remembers you and calls your name I will believe that is love. I will listen to you and study in India. If he doesn't remember you if you introduce yourself or if he takes more than a minute to remember you you should accept that it wasn't true love. Are you game for it? My heart is with him. Ram is here. Ram doesn't know to lose. What is special? Please bring it, I'm feeling hungry. Don't hurry, dear. I have special classes. I have to go to college. - Okay, dear. Make it fast. Oh! Why are you so early? Today is my birthday. Were you born on the birth date of Lord Krishna? Take this. I don't want it. - Why? I love sweets but it's hard to tolerate it. He loves sweets too. Yes! Wish her at least. - Yes. Happy birthday! Mr. Raja Ram. Hi, I'm Nancy. I had a doubt whether you would come or not. Can I join you? - Yes. Thank you. I love it when you run. Running is a wonderful thing. Why are you jogging, you should be running, right? Oh, are you old? We keep growing old and one day we die. Oh, then will you run with me? At this age, you can't run. So at least, I can say that the great Raja Ram lost to me. That is why. Up to that rock. I too, want to run. I haven't run in a while. Let us try. - Okay. I can't. You said that I was old. What do you say now? I accept your strength. Living and running is similar, Nancy. We don't realize it when we run. We know it once we stop. It's okay, I can try. Don't worry. Leave that to me. I'll make you fall for me. - Tell that to my wife. If she accepts, I will. Is your wife beautiful? She is my wife. Of course, she's beautiful. - Is it a love marriage? There may be no marriage when it comes to love. But in marriage there is love. What about you? Don't you have a boyfriend? - Yes, I do. I don't know why, but I want to break up with him. What do you say? - If you want to break up, do it. Why? You are elder to me and you encouraging me to break up. Are you so broad minded? If you feel like breaking up, it's not love. True love will never want a break. All the best. Wow, Mom. You look so beautiful. Do I look that good? - Yes, you do. Even if you haven't been married and haven't been pregnant, you are a mother. After a long time, I am going in front of him. How should I look at him? If you are truly in his heart he will remember you, no matter how you look. Go. What gift are you giving him? I can tell you, but you should not ask. It's personal. After coming here, new things are happening. All these are old, I had left them here. Now that I've returned, they've come back to me. Why are you so tensed? Your hand is shivering. You won't understand. I'm a girl. But you're a little girl. You're scared to lose, I know. Some things are difficult even if we win. If he doesn't remember me, I will die. If he remembers me, I won't be able to live. Your life time is not enough for you to understand this. One love is enough. It has been so long since we saw you. How are you? - I'm good. Are you good? - Yes. Raja Ram's house should be here. They don't live here. They live in Seethammadhara. Okay, thank you. - Good. Go. 'Parvathamma Mansion.' He kept his mother's name. You look lost. It's true, this is my house. There may be someone inside. Ram. Raja Ram. He is not here, he has gone to attend a function. Will you please come in? Sit, he will come. Do you want coffee or tea? That's okay, we just had some. What function has he gone for? - Who are you? I'm his friend. An old college friend. - Oh. He has gone to attend a reception at Park Hotel. What is your name? - Suchitra. Nice name. - Thank you. Okay, we will meet you again. What should I tell sir? Sir? Who are you? - I'm an interior designer. I'm here to complete the pending work here. Oh! Isn't there anyone else at home? Sir's daughter has gone to the studio. She works as a RJ in Radio Mirchi. RJ Parvathi. Parvathi's mother.. She has also gone somewhere. I don't know. Okay, thank you. When the doors were shut, you said, it was your house. When someone opened the door you said that you were his friend. You didn't value your words. How can you expect him not to change? If we don't stand up to our words it means we are in love. Ram's mother said that. I heard it. You look calm, but you are living in darkness. Sometimes behind clothes, sometimes behind doors. Love hides in the heart. There is nothing here. He has a daughter like me and a wife who is your age. Where are we going now? Greetings. - Greetings. Ram. Who? The one on the left? He is so good looking, Mom. Come. What are you waiting for? Come. Ram has come to our function. Raja Ram. Greetings. - Greetings. Shah Jahan resembles love. Even Mumtaz has left behind the remains of their love. A lover's relationship is more pure that that than that of a husband and wife. That is why you both have always stayed as lovers. Why am I saying all this? Distance feels close to me. My dear ones seem far away. I'm a runner. - Mom. He is talking about you, right? That is why you shouldn't allow distance to separate you. Okay> Wish you a happy married life. - Thank you. Do you still believe I will fail? For the first time, I want to lose. Dear, they are coming. Okay, Dad. Mr. Ismail. What are you looking for? I've lost my handkerchief. - Oh! Handkerchief? Hey, what does that mean? This is.. Mine. Is it? Thank you. I thought, I lost it. It's just a handkerchief. - No, it's my life. The letter 'N' is written on it, what does it mean? It means that it's mine. What's the story behind the handkerchief? Raja Ram. She is asking about the handkerchief, shall I tell her? It's my story, right? I'll tell her. "I owe you love." "I left everything for you." "Truly and whole heartedly." "I have waited for you spending each second as an era." "My life without you is a sleepless night." "This search for you has enervated my heart." "I wished for you with my heart." "I prayed for you. Don't you know that?" "I owe you love." "I left everything for you." "I was blessed, when I saw you." "I spoke to you with love filled words." "My love, my heart is forever yours." "My affluence is your friendship." "Your eyes are following me. I can hear your words." "Your memories are my sweet memories." "For the rest of the world it's a memory, but it's my life." "It's killing me." "I have everything, but you." "I can't enjoy it with my heart." "I owe you my love." "I left everything for you." "My love.." "Nazeera.." "Nazeera.." "Life without Nazeera, is a dark land." "Our bodies are separate, but the souls are the same." "She is letting me live with her breath." "My heart is lost in her memories." "I'm like the Ram who believed in Sita." "I have been waiting for her." "Reach me, my dear. Please cover this distance." "Meet my heart, my sweet love." "Love is sweet and calm." "Tie the creepers of love to your heart." "I owe you love." "I left everything for you." "Truly and whole heartedly." "I have waited for you spending each second as an era." "My life without you is a sleepless night." "This search for you has enervated my heart." "I wished for you with my heart." "I prayed for you. Don't you know that?" "Nazeera!" Wow, Mom! Why is your love so great? Love is always great. He must have gone home. Let's go. I won't come. I can't face him. Why should we prove our love to you? It's your fate. You can study wherever you want. You have seen he still has my handkerchief. Doesn't he remember me? Mad fellow. If I test him for you I will be disrespecting my love. It'll be an insult to me. It's nothing like that, Mom. - Mehak. Can you do me a small favour? - What is that? Can you leave me alone for a while? Mom. Mom, I have fallen in love three times but I was not like you. Out of those three boyfriends, no one was like Mr. Ram. We were together for a year. I met him a year after we broke up. I was unable to recognise him after his shave and trim. Why is your love like this? I want to be in love. - If I have a boyfriend like him, I wouldn't care about the world. - If I have a boyfriend like him, I wouldn't care about the world. You missed a lot, Mom! Please just meet him once. Even if he doesn't recognise you, I'll still study here. If he recognises me, I'll hit you. Mom, please. First, I want to see whether he recognises you or not. I just want to see you both together. Please, just for me, Mom. Mehak, it's time for our flight. You wanted to gift him something. Please, Mom. I'll keep that with me. He should not know that I was here. Mom, he is still in love with you. Then how is his wife staying with him? She is in your place, right? Don't you want to see her? - No, Mehak. I can't. I just can't. I won't be able to answer her questions. If a husband doesn't love his wife, it's hell. It's a hell. I can't face her because I am the reason of her personal hell. - No, Mom. Can you increase the volume? "There is no love, none should love." "You are the proof to that. Let me say that." It's nice to hear. That's why, poet Athreya is called an emotional poet. Now this lovely song is for you. RJ Parvathi, signing off. You are listening to Radio Mirchi, 98.3 FM. It's too hot! "There is no love, none should love." Do you know the way to Radio Mirchi office? It's quite close, ma'am. - Take us there. Why? This RJ Parvathi is Ram's daughter. How can you say that? Ram's mother's name was Parvathi. - Oh. She should have been my baby, but that didn't happen. Let's see her. Excuse me? - Parvathi? Yes. Are you Raja Ram's daughter? - Yes. Tell me. - I know your father. I learnt music at your house. Oh! What is your name? Mumtaz. Oh! Why did you question her like that? It's nothing like that, all my friends are Muslims. My dad had a girlfriend. She was from the same community. I think you know her. - I don't know. Why? She left him. Does your mother know her? My mother knows her very well. What is the point of talking about them? Tell me. Nothing. I felt like seeing you. Your voice reminded me of your grandmother. You are also nice. Just like your voice. - Thank you, Ms. Mumtaz. You are very beautiful. Is she your sister? She is my mother. You look so young. You don't look your age. Do you look like your mom? You're right. My dad would always say that. Oh, look! She is my mom. I don't need that 'Mutton Pulihora'. You only have that. Hello, Mom. - Where are you? I am waiting. Sorry, I can't come. You go. You always do this. You don't like your mother. Alas! I don't have a vehicle. I can't come till dad gets here. Why are you looking so sad? - Nothing. What happened, Mom? - It's time for our flight. Let's go. We are leaving. I wanted to give this to your dad. You give it to him. - Wait for five minutes. Dad is coming. You can give it to him. We are running late. We will miss the flight. We have to leave. - Okay. Dad, you should have come a bit early. Why, dear? A friend of yours had visited. - My friend? Hello? Yes, sir. Wow, that's amazing! Thank you, sir. Mom, is anything wrong? No, nothing. There's definitely something. You didn't want to give him the gift. I didn't want him to see me, but it's fine. Nothing will happen even if he does. What's in it? Sir, I have designed a perfect concept for the primetime show. That means, her mother.. She is my friend, Jyothi. What is this, Mom? How can he marry your friend? What's wrong in that? I told him to marry the girl who is waiting for you. I came to know that she is the one. It's good. Marrying the one who knows about us is not cheating, right? Let's meet him once, Mom. We should know why she married him. Why should we know? He didn't make a mistake, right? Are you staying or coming? I won't come. I'll study here. Sure, sir. I'll give a presentation on it. Parvathi. - See you tomorrow. Dad? - Your gift, dear. Oh, sorry, Dad. That is for you. A friend of yours came to my studio and asked me to give it to you. My friend? - Yes, a Muslim lady. A Muslim lady? - Yes. Nazeera. - "Nazeera!" Why did she come here and left so suddenly? Why did you take this from her? You should have asked her to wait for me. She was not Nazeera, she was Mumtaz. She's just like that, dear. Then she was Khannam and now she is Mumtaz. She always lies. Where is she? - She went to the airport. Mehak is going to study in India. Wherever she wants to study make the arrangements for her. Send the details to Malaysia. Mehak is in Vizag. I'll send you her number. Be in touch with her. Okay? Mom, please. Mom, listen to me, please. What will happen if you speak to each other? There is only love between you two, right? That is enough to feel like we have everything. We won't want anything. No. Love is enough. Mom, please. Listen to me. I want to see him looking at you. Eyes and heart have a mind of their own. If we work according to them, we will be ruined. Leave it. Mom. Take care. Thank you. Hey, Nazeera. Hi. Sir, excuse me, - Please, let me in. Visitors are not allowed. - It's important. Please, let me in. Listen to me. - No, sir. Sir, please understand me. - Hello, sir. Excuse me. - I can't help you. Please, I'm a little busy. Please, let me in once. - Sorry, sir. Is that for Nazeera? Nazeera Khannam is my mother. Is she your mother? - What? Are you trying to escape? Where have you been all these days? Do you know how much we searched for you? Do you know how much Ram cried for you? Humans and tears are like twins. From birth to death tears always stay with us. So, it's futile to cry over something. You have learnt a lot. Tears taught me a lot. You are my mother's boyfriend, right? Who told you? - My mother. You spoke so much about love. Even I got inspired by you. Alas! You fell for him as soon as you saw him. When he saw you, you were out of sight. What sort of love is this? After giving the letter, your uncle ran away. What happened? Something happened. Who did you marry? Someone. - What sort of answer is that? I am among those who grieved for you. Answer me properly. Sorry. I heard you got married. Oh! Have you met Ram? He could have told you that we are not married. We were in a live-in relationship. It would be considered good if she told your dad. Has she become frank enough to tell you her story? Hello. You don't have any right to comment on my mother. What do you know about her? She is my mother. But she didn't give birth to me. He broke up with me. He is bored of me. What? I can't believe you. You were in a relationship with your friend's boyfriend. I know. My Ram is not like that. What are you saying? Why is Ram responsible? I'm talking about Seenu. After giving birth to a baby, he was bored of me. It wasn't a marriage. He left with no remorse. After that, my parents found another match. They asked me to throw away the baby. I thought of committing suicide. If Ram wasn't there I would have done that. He wanted to raise my baby. He wanted to see his mother in her. I gave her to him. Then she spoke to you and called you mother and father. She knows everything. Ram didn't want to raise her with a lie. He is her stepfather and I'm her birth mother. We are her parents but not husband and wife. Ram isn't married yet. Not only in his heart, but you are in his life. No one can capture his heart. Didn't she get married? She left the one she loved for her dad. She raised me. What's more than love and motherhood? That's why, even God does not know what to give her. You left him, but your love hasn't left him.
