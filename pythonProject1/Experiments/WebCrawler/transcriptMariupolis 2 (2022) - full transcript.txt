It fell down next to my foot. It is hot. That's no joke. This is death. Give me, I'll throw it away. I have no idea what to do with this diesel. OK, I'll tighten them. - Take your time. That's it. Finished. So. I pulled the hood on and just stood there. - It helped, yes? There was an explosion, high as a balloon. And that's when I have to go to the bathroom. But I made it. Everyone shouted: "Run, run!" They're completely insane today. They're firing with everything they've got. Even with grenade launchers. At least the sun is shining. Hi? Nothing else. It's at the generator factory. Grandmas, I'll tell you for the last time. I don't need any injuries here. Come in! Staring at him doesn't help him. Keep going! This is the final warning. Or you all go home. You won't let me in. Who's going to shoot us now? - What does it matter? Better go after him. - You won't let me. Sveta, I'll take the charger with me. - Good. A bullet hit our apartment. Aunt Alyona, you should wear an icon. - I will. You have to take her away. I don't have it with me. It is too big. Is there an armored vehicle coming? - Yes. The fighting was bad yesterday. Really bad. They came with tanks. Wasn't that near the school? - At the oil mill. The slaughterhouse burned. I have no idea how I put out our fire. The tank was somewhere under the window. But I didn't think about it because my house was on fire. Our windows burst, shots everywhere. Rockets flew and everyone barricaded the windows. I couldn't sleep, my head was pounding. It was buzzing in my ears so bad. However. - He's kind of more... reserved? - Yes. - And I got gas poisoning too. Whenever I hear a sound, my heart jumps out of my chest. For me it's the other way around. - I stood there with the pot for 10 minutes. Even if you don't want to pee, you pee your pants. We're all going to need diapers. The neighbors from our house who are on the 9th floor, haven't left the basement for 13 or 17 days. Where the house next door was is now a crater. Ten meters wide. And about six meters deep. The owner was shredded and thrown onto my roof. He lay there for three days. Half a body up to the navel. In white work gloves, no face, just the back of the neck. He was with me for three days and then he was taken down. I brought him to his yard in a wheelbarrow and left in the wheelbarrow. The house next door caught fire on the very first day. The owner took refuge in the basement, but it's old. From the post-war period. He was buried up to the waist. We then dug it up with the volunteers. For three hours. Otherwise he would have been burned alive. And who were the volunteers? - Well, they were... from here. They came back from the left bank. Their car hit a mine. All five dead. We buried them in three coffins. She wants to go to the toilet. - It bangs heavily out there. Hold it or take the bucket! - Where is it? Ask the boss here! Ask the boss! If you can't hold it, there's a restroom. You just have to make light with something. - What? You have to make light there! The whole building trembles, even the basement. - Of course. What madness. How does the earth endure something like that? When the theatre collapsed, children are said to have been inside. But they are said to have survived. Otherwise it is a mass grave. Here's a piece of debris. - Or part of the house. Shall we go inside? - I think not yet. The walls are shaking. I unchained my dog. Otherwise he would have starved to death or been hit by shrapnel. At least I can feed him here. Lord protect us! We place our souls and our bodies in Your strong hands. Dear God, we ask you for peace. What are you doing, you're strangling the cat! Maybe the blast killed them. Let's take their generator. - OK. We have to pull them out. - Yes. Let's see if there's a battery left in the car. Let's run. What do you mean? I wouldn't like to. - No? No, somehow not in the mood. - Then it's not possible. But there is another car around the corner. Let's wait another hour. Did you find something? Here's a wheel. Come on, let's do it somehow. You stink already. Afraid to get the battery but carries corpses like he's done it all his life. You stink already. Let's get out of here. What do you think, does it fit? Looks like new, doesn't it? - Yes, but maybe bent inside. What? - Let's go as long as they only shoot guns. Come, help me with this! - Let's put the bike on and let's go. Just prefer it. - And then? Take the whole bag, don't take anything out. The whole bag. Victor, watch out! This is for the kids, not for us. Viktor... Be careful it doesn't hit the ground. Otherwise it will break. No, you take it from behind! Hold on now... and put it down. Now turn the wheel. There's a pin there, see? - Where? - There. Yes i see. - Find a piece of wire or something. We put the split pin in and roll the thing. Find a wire and put it in there. Or a nail. Well then! Mantas, watch out! - I'll follow. If you can make this tank, so can I. I'll try to start it later. I think it runs on gas. And where are the cables? No idea. There's even petrol in it. That's it. Cover, then he can stand here. You can definitely use it. A present for the children. Get some rest. CHURCH OF BAPTIST CONGREGATION MARIUPOL Let's get up, pray and thank God. Lord we praise you for your grace this morning. So: "Good morning, Lord!" You can't say good morning when they're shooting. But now we thank you for the quiet night, for the rest and sleep you gave us, Lord. You heard our prayers to Jesus Christ, and your reply was always quick. We thank you for that we survived the terrible yesterday. You protected and blessed our Church, our care, and all who are here. This morning Lord you gave us spring and sun the hope, the rest and the peace in the heart, Lord. Many were able to see whether their houses were still standing or not. Lord, You have blessed us and our church. Let's clean the yard and cook food to keep us strong. How good and merciful You are. At this hour we ask you to bless this meal. Let us eat to nourish and strengthen ourselves, in full gratitude for you, our Lord. Amen. I want to tell you something else. If anyone doubts God's blessings that have been bestowed upon us, he goes to the theatre. There's a mass grave. Go to the factory, go to the other places. There was no protection there because the people did not pray. And now compare, think about it. Was it the walls that protected our lives? Or was it the hand of God? The hand of the Lord. - Amen. Let's go. - I'll wait here. They're gone. - Yes. Something fell on the edge and they flew away. Her lining was blown away by the wind. Throw it big! He already knows how to do it. Yes, Anna! Yes, so that the pigeons come. The wind is too strong, Kolya, you have to tie it up. Or tie the bag tightly and they'll pick it up. Yes, they will pick them up. Do we have something against stomach pains? Anna is looking for something. The ones you hear are harmless. They say we should get out of here. But where should we go? Where? They say: "You have an apartment, you have a house." "Go there!" But where is my house? We should just go away. I mourn my wife. I am alone with a small child. How should I take care of it? I'm sick. Get it wet, it'll burn better. It's too windy. Let's try it inside. Alright, let's see. - It needs to burn harder. It's good now. Careful, that's gasoline! What's over there? - There's an assault rifle by the fence. Thrown away. Then leave it there! Imagine someone picking it up. Shouldn't we bring it in? Throw it behind the other fence when the tanks are gone. A passer-by could take it... - That's right, you're right. Throw it behind the other fence. But I don't know exactly where it is. Don't go there, leave it! Everything OK. - What? - Nothing. No rank insignia or anything else. Just a white band. You're making a video, aren't you? - Yes. I've recorded places like this, but it's so uncomfortable. So pathetic... - Sure. Thank you for the food you give us. We ask You, Lord, bless so that we accept it with thanks. Amen. Come and take! Do they shoot here? - Yes. - Let's go eat. They laid mines. You wanted to kill us, didn't you? Call the dog! - Hey, dog! - Oleg, stop the dog! The car there... I don't like that he's standing there. Otherwise I could extend the wall. How can you explain it to him? We don't need you hurt. How long is this supposed to go on? - Every day. It was boiling, so we simply poured more water. We put too much fruit in it. What is that? - It's okay. That's from over there. Here come the tanks. Do you hear the tanks? - Yes. - One could hit the mine. Are those rocket launchers? - Yes, they shoot continuous fire. They explode where they fall. They have tanks and heavy calibers. Ours don't have anything like that. We could destroy the planet 150 times. Is once not enough? 37 minutes to... - It runs on batteries. 8:39 am, set the time. Get out! You ate all the butter. You turn around once and he eats all the butter. It also shows the day and week. With nuclear weapons we could destroy our planet 150 times over. Is once not enough? - Apparently not for you. Once destroyed is enough. - It just isn't enough for them. One time is enough. Even more than enough. It's all just greed. What are they fighting for? For money. Those fools who kill each other... They're just cattle for slaughter. - Fools! On both sides. You should get on your knees, ask God for forgiveness hug each other and say, "Forgive me!" Instead of dying for some oligarch. I read on the internet... When the Soviet Union existed, people lived normally. Then came the "honest" government. Yushchenko, or who was that? No, not that. Yushchenko came and his hands were clean. - Yes. Life has gotten worse. When a more honest government came, Yanukovych, life got worse. Well, maybe a little bit better. Then came the most honest government, Poroshenko. But it just doesn't get any more honest than the current government. Then came the war. Maybe we don't need an honest government. Do you believe? Or are you just thinking out loud. It doesn't get any more honest than that. Attention, it's boiling! Quick, the lid! Give me the trowel! - Where is it? It's not there, she took it away. Just open the lid a bit. We should stir the potato. Viktor, put down the spoon. The more honest the government, the worse we live. Should everything be clean? - Yes. Look out! Not so fast. All right, stir everything now. That's enough. That'll be a soup! - Even better than yesterday. And what are those stems? - This is dill. Look, even the doves came. It's a couple, isn't it? They probably don't eat that. But who knows. Do you eat sweet corn? - Do not be afraid! These are Kolya's pigeons. - I know he said it yesterday. You're hungry too. - Something's coming. Let's try, Victor. It's probably down there. Go to Sascha, he'll give it to you. He has so much of it. It's thinner, maybe it'll fit. We have to drill there, but we don't have a drill. How to drill without a drill? I can't find the flashlight again. Don't bring it here, go there. I saw parachutes over there. - Parachutes? That means they come from there by plane. Did everyone hear? When the bombing stops everyone is looking for a different shelter. Did you hear? Go to relatives or acquaintances, occupy empty houses! No discussion. We'll shut down the church and seal everything up. Only the church guards remain. So think beforehand! Only the church members stay. The guards stay to prevent looting. They said, "We're staying for a day and a night. We'll sit here and leave in the morning." But then there was no more talk of going. Why? You get food, drink, blankets here. We're running out of groceries! They weren't brought especially for you. There are many empty houses, there are relatives. We took you in while we could. We helped as much as we could. Where should we take the kids while they're shooting? You leave when they stop shooting. But where should I go? Tell me! Where should I go? - Today they supposedly don't shoot. I don't want to and won't go. I won't go. I have nowhere to go All houses are devastated. Pray folks! Have you heard? A sermon. Which sermon? - What you just said. Have you heard? - Yes we have. All. This was not a sermon but a warning. They don't throw us out today, but maybe tomorrow. It's correct. And where then? Where? - Quiet! We pray. Lord, do not leave these prayers unanswered. Give us hope, peace in heart, rest. We are exhausted Support us and give us strength. We thank you for this meal prepared under fire and bombs... Do we go to the mass grave or... I'm still filming this and we'll be leaving in five minutes, okay? What do you mean? What you mean!? Speak Russian to me! Don't speak in riddles! I don't need riddles. Now be careful, we're going up and then let's get out. That's it, the car. A couple! The dog frightened her. He recognizes them all. The white, the black. The black one looks so trusting. - For real? You are already there? - Yes, I'm in the back. The whole kitchen spills, right? - As you can see. The bomb fell right into the industrial area, you see? The house is in ruins, so they abandoned it. My house is a little further. Do you have salt? - Salt? Yes, we're running out of salt. You have to ration it. - It won't be any more. This was my house. There was a porch. All gone. That's when the bomb hit. It blew those seven houses away. Not to mention the garages. One house was hit directly and just flew away. Where the crater is. - Yeah, right on the roof. That was the first bomb. - That was on the fourth. On the fourth of March. At half past ten in the evening. We can go up there. How much wood that is! - Yes a lot. You don't have to go into the forest. - My house doesn't exist anymore. Do you see? The bomb fell here. The whole area is destroyed. That was a house. That's all that's left. That's the situation. I've worked for 32 years except for one day. Now I've become poor in old age. And I ask myself: What did I work for? That's the way it is. This is my situation. Hopeless. There was a house here too, and another there. This is the crater. I don't know how deep it is, maybe 15 meters. Maybe not quite. - But definitely 10. And probably 20 to 30 meters in diameter. They are not very hungry, I fed them yesterday. If not, they would come? - Yes, immediately. - On that sound? Others whistle, but I'm used to it. They're sitting on the kitchen, but that has to be demolished. So... all broken, I have no home anymore. Before the bomb I had planned to renovate. The summer house, the kitchen and so on, but now... I put everything in the last room. Otherwise there would have been a fire here one hundred percent. You still have your pigeons. They were living on the ground before the explosion. But there are still some there. Some? They were 300. - Wow. - Yes. Barely 20 remained. It's nothing. A bomb fell on March 21st. And the house was hit on March 4th. The second cleanest city in the world. Super ecological. Yes, it is super clean. - I remembered that. The last time he came we were sitting in the hut, talked, then he drove away. We were in the same class, we grew up together. So this is my situation now. We are the same age. I've done everything possible. Also bred birds. Look. My budgies. That's it. All over. Since March 4th. Don't you want to go too? The attic was covered with metal. And the porch too. That's why there was no fire. I'm closing here because of the thieves. - Sure. You see, the people there don't have anything anymore either. But they were gone timely. - Yes? Before? Yes, they left earlier. Another crater from a bomb.
