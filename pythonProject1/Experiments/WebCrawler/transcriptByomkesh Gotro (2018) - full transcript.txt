You have jeopardised my honour! Pandey's honour! Stop at once! Sh**! Get in the car. Let's get home, I need to talk to you. Ooh! Lectures on morality! Should I pray for myself? Get inside the car, and follow me. WOW! Look at this beautiful night. You really want to spoil this 'Your Honour'! This is a night for 'Chopin's Nocturne'... or maybe, 'Beethovan's Silence'. Get inside the car Satyakam, What do you think of yourself! You are crossing your limits now. Your mother and I will no longer tolerate this. The entire society is cursing us. Either you rectify yourself... - or else I will... - Or else you will? You will, what? Don't you dare! Move the car at once! Enough of your father-son pretentions! Your morality, values arises sheer disgust in me. For the last time I'm telling you... in future... don't try to impede my way. The path you've taken, will take you straight towards Hell! - Towards Hell! - Suits me. I better be the 'King of Hell', than enslaving in heaven. Now give way, will you? Where are you going Satyakam? To hell. "A letter to Kesar Khan, the Monarch of Pathans." "From the Queen of King Bhunag from Kaitun" "Haven't your thirst for battle quenched yet?" "The spring is passing like the sands of time." "Come, with your troop of soldiers." "Let loose ourselves, in Holi colours." "Wars are over, so my days in the city." "This is a letter from the Queen of Kaitun ". "With glittering eyes and a cunning smile..." "Keshar goes close and says..." "Death, no more enthralls me..." "It's your beauty that craves me to die." Very funny! You skipped so much. Is it my fault! Your beauty beguiled me. I could hardly concentrate in poetry. Let's travel to Rajasthan? 'Harikhela', the 'Rajputans', and the royalty! Will you? Let's stick to the poetry for now. This is not the time to be literal. Here comes your mate. Go. It's him. "Meet me, the way you are... "Why these decorums!" "Let your hair flow carelessly..." "Let the face glow with innocence." "Have rommance ever followed the conventional path?" Stop it. "Why this anger?" "Pathan pleads the Queen..." - "Shower your gentility, my dear Queen". - Enough of this now. I so, wish to travel. - Look at the season. - I guess, she's right. This is a weather to escape the routine life, Byomkesh. Absolutely. Kashmir then! Mad or what! "Though I wish to travel, my mate is reluctant." "My body is chained, still mind wanders." "Why this cruelty, my almighty! - Who wrote this? - Why would I tell. People crave for an oppurtunity to travel. But, look at you drowned in the Bengali poetry. On 21st Feb, a nation sacrificed their lives to honour mother-tongue. How can one decieve his own culture, my dear Writer! That's true. What about some tea? - Right, can you... - No, not now. Please take me to a trip. Will you? Okay, fine. I will. - How much will it cost? - Near about a thousand. - A thousand! - Well, that's too much, I can't afford. I'll check. Listen... I'm looking for 'The Truthseeker', Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi. Yes, this way. Please come. Thank you. - It's him. - Byomkesh Bakshi. Please be seated. Nice to meet you. Myself, Satyakam Das. - Please. - Good, I'm to the right person. Please sit. Your reason to be here? Nothing much. A little adventure in our mundane lives. If I get killed, I want you to investigate it. I'll pay now; incase, I can't later. A thousand rupees. How's the idea? Good, but I've querries. But, I might not answer all. Instead of saving you, why do you want me to investigate your death? I've my own reasons. For your, uninterrupted investigation! Incase of my sudden death, Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi will take charge of the investigation. Tulips are such rare to find! Excuse me. Actually, I'm from Mussoorie. We own a departmental store there, 'Suchitra Emporium'. Good morning sir. Good morning sir. My grandfather Mr. Ramanath Chowdhury... and Mr. Ushapati Dos were partners. Ooh! Good morning sir. Sitangshu's here? I'll check sir. Now, me and Ushapati Dos, I mean my father... are the current partners. My grandfather was the doctor of the British army. He named the store after his daughter, my mother. Give me a minute. So this is, what keeps you going! Since, I was 20 years old. Love it. How old are you now? I was born on 7th July, 1927; and this is 1952, so I'm 25 now. That's my better-half, Satyabati. My gratitude Madam. Hmm! Satyabati, Satyanneshi, Satyakam; what a lovely triangle! I take tea only once in a day, Madam. - And for the other times... - Okay. Thank you. Women with 'Elevated Canine' are often proved to be wise. Looks like, you know a lot about women! You can say that, I love women. Rather, they find me very affectionate. Who told you about me? I have someone there in Mussoorie. You'll get to know, if you come there. But if, I manage to survive till then. - You're very much sure that... - That I'll die. Death is the only thing that's certain in our lives, Mr.Bakshi. The whole of the Mussoorie wants to kill me. And the reason behind so? I'm very popular there... or notorious. Regarding women! Bull's-eye! Hmm. Women find me irrestible, because I know, how to appreciate them. I can make them happy. Sensuality is like an art to me. Please keep your voice low. Please. Seems, you've not spared women from respectable families. Rebellion is a refreshement to the self. When you got to play, you got to play all out. Aren't they beauties? My fingers are magical, Mr.Bakshi. May it be a camera or.. Come, to Mussoorie. You might get your answers there. I guess, your death will come during our stay in Mussoorie. Bullets have been fired already. Don't I have a nice collection? There's a bar in Mussoorie, named 'Red moon'. I spend most of my evenings there. So, in case you come then... And Mr. Bakshi... I know, who wants to kill me. But I won't tell you. See you then. Oh god! You get anything? Yes, that's he's a legend. What a spolied brat! Such disrespectful sense of sarcasm! Shameless! Anyways. Kashmir! Truth-seeker! The wind is blowing into a distinct direction. That, I agree. Mussoorie then? A train to Dehradun and then a car to Mussoorie. It won't take much long. You're smoking too much these days. Sir. Hold it. Good night sir. Good night. Give me a kilo of apple. Right, this one. Mr. Dos... Inspector Pandey, you here? Can we talk? Sure. - Keep it on the car. The driver will pay you. - Sure, sir. Are you well aware of your son? Well, he's my son. I'm bound to be aware of him. But I have my doubts. Do you really know him? Your son is spoiling the ambience of this place! He's disrespecting every single woman here. Do you know all this? I'm sorry. I have heard some rumors. But this time he crossed all his limits. He tried to dillute my honour this time. I've seen it with my own eyes. On my house with my daughter that son of a... I'm warning you Mr. Dos. Make him understand of his deeds. Next time, my gun won't miss it's target. I'll crack his skull if he dares again. You actually know, nothing about your son! My beloved sends no news... Is he home yet? Not yet. My beloved sends no news... Will you talk to son or not? Does he listen to me! Then what will I do? What we do? The whole of the Mussoorie is shaming on us. He has to change his behavior! What's the matter? I brought the tea. Keep it in that room. Hmm. A characterless, pervert, rascal... he's now engaged with Inspector Pandey's daughter too. Leave the sense of fear... but how can he not have a basic self-control! Pandey insulted me in the market. What would I do! Do I have an answer for that? Pandey tried to shoot him! Be grateful to God, that he missed. Either you'll make him understand... how to behave in a civilised manner... otherwise I'll... I'll make sure that he rots in jail. Prison will be his right place. You spolied girl! How can you be so shameless! I'll do whatever I want. Well said! So, you've decided to take down the family honour? Am I right? Family honour! You said well. Is really any family honour left? It's all a masking! I am in love with Satyada. Chumki! How do one spell it, 'Mussourie' or 'Mussoorie'? There's a local shrub named 'Mansoor'. I see. The name 'Mussoorie' has evolved from that. Once, an officer of East India Company... Lt. Fredrick Young... fell in love with this place during his hunting session here. After that... But is it true that... there were warnings in the malls of Mussoorie... written 'Indians and Dogs are not allowed'? Really? Well, yes. but it was before independence. Motilal Nehru knew it... but still he kept disobeying the law and paid charges. He did the right thing. Hello! Satyakam Dos speaking... It's me, Chumki. What's wrong with your voice? Everyone is angry with you. What have you done this time? Uncle is also cursing you. But it's you, whoose words matter. Say, you love me. Let it be! I heard, you were fired at! Are you frightened? I don't know. Fear trades in my heart, whenever you're not around. But I can see you. Your hair flowing like a cascade... your bare back... that smell of your hair. Keep your door open at night. I'll be waiting. Hurry up! Take out the luggage from the car. And you go, open room no.1 & 2. Help me out. Here, take it. Greetings. Welcome! - Take it inside. - Isn't it beautiful? - That way. - Yes, splendid. This is my room. Keep the things here. And ours? - I guess, that one. - Yes, that one. (-First Edition of 'Abol Tabol', by Sukumar Ray-) You kept this in my bag? - '25 years!' - What? "25 years have gone with the blessings of my ancestors." "But now, I feel my time has come finally." "Who can predict the inevitable future!" 25! You mean Satyakam? Hmm. The boatman has no way, than to wait for the boat to sink. And we'll just be the spectators from the shore? Not exactly that. One can always look after, the symptoms of a storm coming! But look at this weird persona... he, himself has no wish to be saved. He's aware of his murderer, but still not telling me. What about meeting him once? I've a feeling, we'll meet him soon. How do you see our future Satyakam? Let's just live the present for now, my darling. Are we not planning our future? These nights are all we have. Please, think of something. I can't stay away from you anymore. I'm like snake's venom... one drop will lead you to ecstacy... more of it to death. Do you really care about me? Emily! Satyakam! You Sw***! Now you've targeted her too! No. This shirt worths 300 rupees. You can't even pay for it's repairment! So, leave me beggar! I'm warning you for the last time. I love Emily. What! You love her! You are relayed on us. Bloody refugee! Have you taken my permission for it? Your permission! If we kick you out, you'll have nowhere to go. Satyakam! Now the crow wishes to be a peacock! I'll kill you! I'll finish you! Go on! Go on, I'm enjoying the show. Good. I will finish you, I swear on myself. Good bye. Mussoorie was never that much popular unlike Shimla or Nainital. It was a bit off-track as a tourist spot. Are you tired? Brother, can sudden snowfall occur here? Well, not impossible in a rainy weather. See there. Such beauty! Don't you remember, I told you that earlier. Yes, sister. This one? This two? There you go. Come here, sister. It's cheap. Brother? - Yes? - Will you buy this? No, I'm just looking. - What about this one? - What is more popular here? Wait, let me ask him... Where did he go? I'm coming in a minute. If he comes, tell him to wait. Okay. Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi! What a pleasant surprise! - You're a magician. - No, please Pandey ji. No, you're. You arrived at my house. How come? Meera, please come here. - Yes, father! - Take care of your things, look! You left it in the market. Thank you. Thank you is not enough; touch his feet! He's the 'Truth-seeker', Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi, my friend. - Touch his feet, come on. - No need of it. God bless you. What about Mr. Ajit and sister? - Both of them are here. - That's good. Please come, it's my honour. Dr. Palit is in good health. His chamber is also going well. - Bring it soon! - Yes, here it is. Do you remember Narmada Shankar? That aloof guy! He's now imprisoned for 20 years. That's good. You remember them? In Varanasi... - Yes, absolutely. - Yes. - Please have meal here. - Today it's not possible. Yes, Pandey ji, some other day. Anyways, they're veg. I'll bring the tea then. Yes, go bring the tea. So, you here? Satyaka... Bati! Satyabati wanted to see the hills. And Mussoorie is such a beautiful place. When did you come here? Go, help your mother. I got transfered from Varanasi to here. Then... well, that's my daughter Meera. Yes, I've met her. She's a very sweet girl. She used stay in her grandparent's house. I see. So, I decided to bring them here to stay together. Now, I'm looking for a boy to settle her marrige. Pandeji? Which way is the Suchitra Emporium? Slow steady! Who told you about me? I have someone in Mussoorie. You'll get to know, if you come there. There's a detective in Kolkata. 'Truth-seeker'... Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi. He's acquainted with my father. Even Sardar Vallabhbhai ji is fond of him. Suchitra Emporium! Actually, we forgot the warm clothes. Didn't except it will be so cold here. I heard we can get them there. That's true, they've good items. Surely, go there. Uncle, you've to do the justice! - Not now! - Then when? He's eyes are on Chumki and Emily both; teach him a lesson. Well, you can never be me. Do you see that! Okay, calm down. I'll talk to your aunt about it. Let's see, what I can do. That means, Pandey ji's daughter is having an affair with Satykam. Satyakam is the casanova of Mussoorie. Satya, look here. From Meera, he got to know about me. Give me a smile! All you two care about is work. But at least, give him a smile. - Stop there you rascal! - Catch him. - Don't let him ran away! - Catch him! This is what you all got! Idiots! - Brother, there he is. - Yes, that's him. What was it all about? - And where did you go? - Didn't you notice, it was our casanova. Satyakam was being chased. But why did you go there? What if they've hurt you! Why would they hurt me! I was just working. Fine, stick with your works. Satya lis... Satya stop! What are you two up to? Don't you need a new coat? You astonish me with your quick wit! Come. Well and good. It's a new arrival, of good quality. Mrs. Bakshi, it's a pleasure. Same here. - We're here too. - Of course. Please come, this is all I have. I thought you may be... well just a minute! I've a gift for you. No gifts, please. Why so? I won't take any thing for free. I came here to buy things, but the prices are beyond my reach. That you leave on me. There's beautiful Mink-coat for you. No, thank you. I won't be able to wear things made from harming animals. I beg your pardon. What harm will come from one Mink-coat? A lot harm will come. Buying one Mink-coat will result into the killing of more Minks. Isn't it? And you know how many minks have to be killed for one coat. Also, if animals are killed like this... humans will be the only creature left on earth. Okay, okay, I get it. I guess, there's no such problem with woollen coats? Cashmere! No sheeps are harmed to procure the wool. Please come. Seems like, you're not even safe on the roads. - Oh! you saw then. - Well, that's my job. What thrill! I quiet enjoy all this; like an adventure. Mr. Ushapati Dos, my partner. Myself, Byomkesh Bakshi. My better-half Satyabati... and renowned writer Ajit Bandapadhyay. - Tourist? - Hmm. From Kolkata. Emily! Just a minute. Isn't she pretty? Recognised? Let's go. Hello! Hello! I was waiting for you, what took you so long? Come! Want to buy sarees also? No, I was just seeing. Hmm! Emily, I was expecting you sooner. Where were you? Sorry, I'm late. We have a wonderful new collection. And here's your favourite perfume. - See anything you like. - Thank you. What audacity he has! Even in his father's presence... Well, wilderness suit in forest... get it! Which one would be better? Tell me. Do you like it? Which colour, this one? This one is good. - Show her the best one. - Sure, sir. I'll just be back. - So, this one? - Which one do you like? What an excellent choice. 100% Cashmere. One minute. Well, it's price... Dhananjay uncle, prepare the bill. Give it a 50% discount. It's a special customer. I'll be back. Here's my address. 'The Retreat'. Thank you. You'll need it eventually. There's a place nearby; why not go for a tea? Well, I don't think it's the right time to have tea. Tea, drinks and love hardly cares for time. Let's remember this sweet meeting with some sweetness. Tea with honey! One second! - I don't want to go. - I'm with you, right. Lovely! Here you go. Thank you. Let's go then. One of the best hotels of here. I bring my guests here. - Your tea Madam. - Thank you. Havana! Wanna try it? They have the best cigars all around the world. But has a dictator like Batista! Strange! Correct! It's his second time in power. Actually, sometimes we choose to adjust with injustice. But when they choose to fight... they bring revolution. Cuba has to wait some more years. For the person, who'll bring the revolution. Listen, your grandfather was the doctor of the military... But how come your father came here? He's from Komila. Later, he shifted to Kolkata and met my grandfather. Can't we talk about something else? I'm not very much interested above 35. Where you all staying? - Madho Bhavan. - Well, good place. Your acquintance with women is taking a sharp bend. I can't resist. Sorry, they can't resist me. Women crave for me. How's the honey in the tea? I don't think, this is suiting me. Let's go. Do show me, how the coat looks on you. Such a desperate boy! I've never seen anyone like him! And you didn't even answer him once. I'm not here to rectify his character. In one word, he deserves a tight slap. He has no sense of talking to women. Unless, one is stung... you don't feel the venom in the veins. See, he's mocking me. Not at all. - Why would I! And you've your lady life. - What! - Bengali literature. - Okay. Take this Satya. Go grab some rest. We're coming in a minute. Where you two off to? It's almost dark. Well, he can't stop the darkness, can you? This is not the time to joke! We'll just take a round... Come back soon. I've seen enough beauties... but in the words of Kalidas you're... "Opaque skinned." "Figure that kisses the sky" "Lips burning like fire" "Freckled eyes like a deer" "Naval bestowing mysteries of the world... I'm coming, to interpret these lines to you. Leave at once! Leave! Why does he take photographs of... Emily, Meera and other girls? Mental disbalance. Have you not seen his eyes? They're never at ease. Even his smile seems like he's hiding something... But what is he trying to hide? That's what I'm trying to fetch out. A sense of attraction between men and women is natural... but why will it lead to adultery! And what can be the motif behind killing him? Revenge for his deeds. Look who's coming! Where is he going now? Evening amusements. We've to find out, who holds the strongest motif. Let's go. Love is a game. I have your name. Say... and play... tonight. Poison has left... it's scar on love. When light leaves... night calls for a treat. Darling, my loins are in fire... loose yourself in desires. Let it go, my darling, let it go. Rock, you look into my eyes and... rock, you drink through my lips and... rock, you dance with my hips and, Rock, Rock, Rock n Roll. Poison has left... it's scar on love. Done with the night... Who's out of sight? Who can tell? Who knows, who can tell? Love is a game, I have your name. Say it, and play it tonight. Your hearts on fire, just skip a bit... Repeat and sip it tonight. Dark is the night, and I'm in the moon. There's spring in the air, and, I'm in bloom. Bring on the bit, and Rock n Roll. Rock, you look in to my eyes, and... rock, you drink through my lips and... rock, you dance with my hips and, Rock, Rock, Rock n Roll. Ajit! Rock, you dance with my hips and, Rock, Rock, Rock n Roll. Poison has left... it's scar on love. Something smells very fishy! I'm worried about you. But why? Bachelorette, don't let this wind blow you off. Be prepared! Rock, you look into my eyes and... rock, you drink through my lips and... rock, you dance with my hips and, Rock, Rock, Rock n Roll. Rock, you look into my eyes and... rock, you drink through my lips and... rock, you dance with my hips and, Rock, Rock, Rock n Roll. Come with me. Ajit! You Sw**e! What do you think of yourself! Don't you dare! Don't! Sir, are you okay? I'll see you again. We can't waste anymore time. Enough of roaming around, we'll start our work from tomorrow. - First we'll... - To Mussoorie club. That blue blazered guy had it embossed, 'Mussoorie club'. Your company has elevated my senses too. Good one. Satyabati is sitting in the dark. Hmm! - Think of an excuse. - Let me handle it. Who is it? Tell me, who are you? Satya, it's me. What's wrong? What's the matter Satya? He was here. Right here. Satya! I've no wish to stay here anymore. Please take me home. I'm with you. Don't be scared! I came here on a request. And he's truly in trouble. Trouble! What about my trouble! We're waiting for this characterless, shameless boy's death! What if, today I didn't close the door, then? Answer me! There's no need of compassion for such a person. I've made a promise. - And I can't... - Why don't you understand? Please, I'm terrified! Byomkesh is with you, then why such fear! I'll take your leave now. You take over now. And carry on your truth seeking. Satya! As long as I'm with you... no harm can touch you, my dear. "Opaque skinned" "Figure that kisses the sky" "Lips burning like fire" What was the name of Satyakam's mother? - Suchitra. - No. The Satyakam of 'Chandogya Upanishad'... - Tell me, I can't remember. - It's Jabala. Right, Jabala. Without you, the truth of my life... the 'Truth-seeker' has no value. All good in Kolkata? Yes, the political ambience is in much control now. Still, there's enough problem with refugees. That problem lies here also. - Refugees are here too? - Yes. There's one thing though... independence has resulted to a lot of homelessness. - Tea? - Yes, please. I'm very much dissapointed with the young lads of today. Such shame! They forgot to respect women. They failed to understand... to realise... the real value of independence. Looks like, you're worried! Yes. I see a father, in more turmoil than a cop. That you're right; I'm indeed worried about my daughter. Pandey ji, are you acquainted with Mussoorie club? Like someone in particular? Yes, I know the secretary, Harindar Singh. I'll inform him about you. - Byomkesh! - Thank you. Yes, tell me. Come a bit closer. Stand beside Satyabati. Pandey ji, look here. Smile everyone! Splendid! What happened? I feel uncomfortable. The Britishers are gone; then why hold on to their traditions! 200 years of colonialism will leave it's trails behind. - So try to fit in, writer. - Fit in my foot! How can you manage in this? Trust me, you look great. You know, some Bengalis are very close to my heart. You mean Tagore? Yes, along with Tagore and Subhash Bose, I admire the cricketers also. - Good mornig sir. - Good morning. And you're from the Kolkata of Prabir Sen. Prabir sen aka Khokon sen. Yes, the brilliant wicket-keeper. He stumpped Australia's Bradman in the year of 1947-48. Exactly sir. What a player he was. Please come. Mr. Bhootnath! Here! Please have a seat. Thank you. Mr. Bhootnath they're from Bengal. Please sit. Myself, Byomkesh Bakshi. I would like to talk about Mr. Satyakam Dos. How do you know him? I happen to know him. Last night, I saw you two having a brawl. So, came to talk. Why? Are you on his side? I just want to know the reason behind such actions. Bloody character... That boy has no character. His parents are so gentle, well-behaved. But he's a bloody pervert. A lot of people complained about him. He's causing tantrums to every girl here. One chance, we all will beat him badly Well, he deserves such medicine. Just one thing, don't so anything, that causes his death. Otherwise beat him, as much as you want. Okay? Let's go Ajit. - Thank you Mr. Singh. - Of course. - We'll take you leave. - See you. This tastes good. What is this? Honey-Waffle. Tell me, one thing Byomkesh- Aren't you angry with Satyakam's audacity? Very much, I'm. That's why, I told them... to teach him a lesson. Keep eating. I'm coming in a minute. Wait, stay like that. Send the invoice to the Church's Father. So many breads! What's it for? It's for the kids of church. - Who is he? - That's brother Sitangshu. He's the nephew of the owner of 'Suchitra Emporium'. - Mr. Ushapati right? - Yes. Kindly give us the bill. Byomkesh! Look what I got. Jim Corbet's father, worked as the post master of Mussoorie. This little libraries are heaped with such rare informations. Have a look at this vital news. It's on the sufferings of Refugees in 1947-48. A lot of people migrated here from the East Bengal. Keep it. Pandey ji, your house looks remarkable. Isn't it too good to be a government quarter! Nothing like that. I didn't get it. Thank you. A good sumaritan lend me this house. Once, I get the quarter, we'll shift there. - How's the work pressure here? - Fine. Little crimes do take place. Crime in such divine place! Irony of mankind. What were you telling about refugees that day? Thank you. They came from a place of Bengal. - His name some Coop... - Ranaghat Cooper's Camp. They came from there. Some went to work in the hospitals... while others took shelter under the missionary. And there's the 'Suchitra Emporium' people... Mr. Ushapati? He has given shelter to two people. - Some curd? - No, thank you. Not me. It's he, who loves curd. Okay. (Laughs) Byomkesh! Name an ancient river of South India. Tunga Bhadra. Great! Well said. Let's leave. Aunt... This is too much now. I can't hold my temper anymore. How can you still be quiet? He's now spoiling Chumki as well. Even taking advantage of Emily. - It's me who... - Sitangshu! - How can say this to me? - Why can't you tell this to Satyakam? Tell me! He's bringing shame to all of us. Do something, now. Please! What can I do? All is going out of my hand. Enough is enough! - Let me do it! - What? - Give me the revolver. I'll finish him. - Don't. Don't do it. Are you out of your mind? What is it? In the end, Satyakam turned into a monk; according to the 'Upanishad'. This boy won't get that chance. If something foul happenes here... I won't be liking that. Satya! Because of darkness there is light, for evil there is good. Mussoorie is famous for a terrific crime. Which one? That Savoy hotel, where we had tea... In 1911, an English lady was found dead there. Later, a famous crime-thriller writer... gave birth to her eminent detective character based on this incident. Agatha Christie's... Hercule Poirot. Right, what was the name of it? "A Mysterious Affair at Styles" Exactly. I'm done with this life now. - What do you want then? - A marriage! Let's go to Dehradun... and start a new life. You're well aware of my life. I wasn't born to be a family man. I was born to destroy it. Life! The sun of my life, has eclipsed long ago. I'm nocturnal. Night-crawler! Byomkesh! The boat has sunked! What! Satyakam died last night. I just heard it. Don't let anyone trespass here! And behave a bit politely with the old people here. Pandey ji! Let him in! Byomkesh ji! You here! I heard Satyakam died last night. - Yes, right. - That way! Come. There's no need of investigation for him. Don't waste your time. But why no investigation? How does it matter! It was his fate! He deserved it. Everyone deserves justice in the eyes of law. Byomkesh ji! Listen to me. This is a local incident. Why do you care then? You can't suddenly walk in to investigate. Pardon me, but I can't allow you. I didn't ask for it anyways. I know you had issues with Satyakam Dos. But, I knew him before coming here. I also know that, he was involved with Meera. And you know, I don't waste my time without reasons. I'm not here to travel only; there's a specific reason behind it. Any problem Mr. Pandey? Myself, Byomkesh Bakshi, we meet again. 'Suchitra Emporium'! - Tourist? - Hmm. From Kolkata. I remember. What do you want? Let's have a talk inside. Nice to meet you. This way? Come in. - Look, I don't feel much well now. - I know. I knew Satyakam before coming here. He gave me the charge to investigate his death earlier. For your uninterrupted investigation. He's 'Truth-seeker', Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi. Satyakam paid me in advance... for this investigation. He had a hunch that he'll be killed. Can you tell me, why he felt like that! What happened last night? I couldn't sleep. I was awake till late night. All of a sudden... a sound... Mahadev! Turn on the lights! Yes, sir. - Who's there? - Sir, what is it? - What's wrong sir? - Oh my god! Satyakam! - Uncle! - Come here at once! So it was, you and Mahadev who saw him first? No, Sitangshu and Chumki was also there. - Uncle! - Yes, tell me. Here's a glass of juce. Oh! You haven't ate anything. Have this. She's? Chumki! My niece. Distant relation. My sister's daughter. Her brother is Sitangshu. Their parents died in the riot of 47. They had nowhere to go. So, I brought them here. Mr. Bakshi! Please! I feel wretched now. I hope you understand my situation. Please excuse me for now. Hey you! Greetings sir. Tell him, what you saw last night. I was sleeping. Then I heard a very loud noise. It almost broke my slumber. Then I heard, master screaming. So, I ran to him. There I saw junior was lying near the entrance. Can you give a bit details about it. His face was lying on the floor. And he was shot from the behind. His torch was rolling on the ground. I don't know anything else. Satyada, was never liked by anyone. They all scolded me. They all behaved badly with him. We're living on their mercy. So, you knew that he used to come home late. Hmm. Your Satyadada was quiet popular among women, right? What do you say? I don't believe you. His faults can... There are two sides of a coin. Every coin has it's both sides. Mr. Ushapti took you here, right? Yes. From 'Ranaghat Cooper's Camp'. Yes. You and your brother came here? Me, my brother and sister Savitri came here. Who's Savitri? She was with one of our camps. She was from Jessore. On brother's request uncle took her here. Where is she now? She's with the church now. In the missionary quarter. She sings at the hotel. He was a treacherous dog. A pervert! They have a lot of money. Thus, he treated others as inferiors. Uncle and aunt are soft spoken people. They could never tell him anything. Bloody characterless! It was his fate that he recieved. - He's your cousin! - So what? Should I overlook all his faults for that! Sorry, I was never raised with such learnings. I have immense hatred for people like him. And I hated Satyakam too. Because, he was involved with your sister? You're seeking the truth! Right? You heard that right. Don't try to! Why? The consequences will not be good. My past records are not very good. I'm not concerned about the past. And why would I listen to you? Who do you think you are! You'll listen. This is Mussoorie Mr. Bakshi. Not Kolkata. Try not to step in trouble. Truth seeking is not just my job. It's my passion. Truth never cares, be it Kolkata or Mussoorie. And yes! I know, it was you who, appointed people to beat him. Not just a truth-seeker, I'm an all rounder too. My both hands work simultaneously. Be it Kolkata or Mussoorie. So, you better watch out. Splendid! - You're still here! - Yes, we're. I've lost my son Mr. Bakshi! I haven't completed his cremation rituals yet. I'm keeping his request only. Nothing much. Take it as his last wish. Fine. Say. - I want to talk to his mother. - I was telling that... This is Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi. Satyakam, appointed him for investigation before his death. He left a letter as well. - Also with advance payment... - Leave! Leave right now. He was my son, this is my house. He's no more; so, there's no need of all this. Please, let us stay in peace. Please leave. Hand over the body to the family after post-mortem. - Okay? - Right, sir. The post-mortem report? You'll get it soon. What do you think? Yes, he was shot. From the very backside. - Let me know the details of the bullet. - What! Rifle or revolver! Or may be service revolver! You rip, as you sow. What's that? - Looks like a silver foil! - Right. Looks like, someone made it on purpose. It's pasted with gum. You saw it Mr. Pandey? No, I didn't. Did you see it? See what? This silver foil stuck in here. You saw it? No, the bulb was out of order from past few days. Sitangshu, Chumki also didn't tell me anything regarding this? Fine, we'll leave then. See you Mr. Pandey. - Don't place your feet there. - Okay. Did you notice one thing? May be, no one is expressing anything but... they all have a sigh of relief on their faces. But not for long, since you are here. Who are your suspects? Tell me the motifs respectively. In my mind, first is Mr. Pandey... The incident regarding his daughter. Chilli pickle! Want some? No. And others? The poeple of Mussoorie club; Mr. Bhootnath and his fellows. Also Sitangshu. - No more. - That's right. Why are you so quiet? I've no wish to take part in this. After all, it's not my work. I'm done with my meal. Excuse me. Satya! What's wrong with her? She's disturbed with the whole incident regarding Satyakam. Pass me the batter. Polishing it off alone! What's with Sitangshu? That night, we saw Chumki and Satyakam, remember? Sitangshu, was also there. Loitering at them in anger. - Is that so? - Yes, I saw him. I feel like meeting someone else also. Who? Who took shelter under Father Huart. She, who sings at the hotel. Emily! Emily, right? That was her name right? Looks like you're remembering names now! Anger can destroy families, duties and all. You know nothing of the responsibilities of fathering a daughter Mr.Bakshi. Do you really think, I've killed him? You do have a strong motif. - Meera and Satyakam... - It's better to leave that matter here. Anyway, you're investigating. So you'll come to know. And details of the bullet? For that, you'll have to wait for the post-mortem reports. But... the bullet entered from his left side and is still inside the body. The scar is small though. Hmm. That means it could be a pistol or a revolver. And he was shot from the back. Does Mr. Ushapati own any revolver? Please check in your licence renewal records. - Mishirji? - Yes sir? Bring the licence renewal file here. As much as, I remember that gun... was registered under Ramanath Chowdhury's name. Satyakam's grandfather. - Here it is, - Yes, give me. First, it was under Ramanath's name... and later... it was transferred under Mrs. Suchitra Dos. Mr. Pandey, Satyakam was having problems with... some the Members of Mussoorie club, right? They're not of that sort. They're more interested in sports. And Sitangshu? That person has very bad history. He was involved in many brawls. And some days earlier... Mishirji! Bring that complain file. Sure sir. Here's a hotel, named 'Red Moon'... Here it is sir. - There he had a brawl. - What kind of? There's a singer. Regardiing, her Sitangshu made a brawl. - What is her name? - Emily Savitri Biswas. She's a Christian. Don't try to act smart with me. I'll kill you. Bloody parasite. - Thanks a lot, Mr. Pandey. - Take it. Let's go. If the revolver is now owned by Suchitra debi... and the bullet is of that revolver... What if, Sitangshu took it, then? No, but it is her right? Yes, that's what is confusing. Hold this. Why? You scoundrels! Lousy! Scurrilous! Run! Run everyone! "Old habits die hard". "No matter how much you try" but question arises, how long will you try! You're okay right? You deserve an applaud writer. I'm at all ease now. Let's go. - Take your watch! - Yes, give me. Byomkesh! How do I start? You're here to stop me. How's that for a start? Fine then! I'm here to offer you some money. Stop this investigation now. I'm not in a good condition now. I've already lost what I had. The investigation will increase the scandals. Are you trying to save someone of your own? Late Mr. Ramanath's revolver is now at your house. If the bullet that killed Satyakam belongs to that revolver then... How much did he pay you? So you've seen the murder! No. Neither I've seen; nor I know about it. I'm giving you thousand rupees. Close the investigation. Don't you want to know, who killed your son? No, I don't. My loss is done. Who has gone, is gone forever. But whom I've raised as my own... must have a secure future. How can you think I'll leave the work? So, you won't? You know Mr. Bakshi... some people are endowed with pain. The more you dig, the more the pain will rise. And will cause harm too. Even death can... take place. That means, I've guessed it right. You're hiding someone. Some truths are better kept hidden. I'll go now. Greetings! We're on the right track. This is all planned! We must counter Sitangshu now. I'm not getting one thing! What about Mr. Pandey? May be he has committed the crime; and blaming Sitangshu! Then why would Mr. Ushapati wants to hide the killer? Sitangshu is important to him, after Satyakam! No, I can never wear this! May it costed less, but money is money Satyabati! He knew, he would die. Still he didn't change. God knows, how many women he has conned! Why always women are conned by men? Sometimes, women knowingly falls into traps. Don't they? Who's there? Drink this water! I was at Haridwar! How did all this happen? That's why you came here? Father, told me that you're investigating. He'll never come back right? Whom are you trying to save Meera? Scoundrel! I'm suffering, what I deserve. Please leave my father! Please leave my father! So, Mr.Pandey is guilty? I can't see my close ones suffer! Please stop this investigation. Please stop this investigation. Do you know Emily? Who? Emily! Yes! She's a singer of "Red Moon". Don't tell father, that I came here. I won't. Will you go alone? Take care. All got messed up! Amen! - How's your study going? - All good. - Thank you. - Here, take it. All is fine. - Move ahead. - Thank you. "Haisha, Huisha, We all fall down". "Ring-A-Ring-A Roses..." Myself, Byomkesh Bakshi. The "Truth-seeker". Satyakam Das, appointed me for the investigation of his murder! Everyone was leaving the country then. I was also leaving, after losing all I had. I met Sitangshuda and Chumki there. Then! Uncle, took us here. Father Huart... gave me shelter here. And Satyakam? I met him at 'The Retreat'. We acquainted there. Sitangshu loves you. Because, of Sitangshuda I'm alive now. But he started taking control over me. I was in love with Satyakam. Sitangshuda thought, Satyakam made me against him. That day when Satyakam died, he ran to me. I've tolerated enough; today you've to decide. I've to perform now. I won't leave without knowing your decision. What decision? Have you no shame? It was I, who resued you; gave you a place to stay... And you're with Satyakam... So you want a price for gratitude? Just because you saved me; doesn't mean I'll love you. Yes, I'm in-debt to you. But... But what? Say it... Say it! I'm in love with Satyakam. Emily! I abdicate my character, my idles in the name of survival. - But for how long? - That's what I'm sayiing. Come with me, we'll go far away from here. We'll be happy. Trust me Emily, we'll be happy. I want to be rich. I love Satyakam. Not you. Don't meet me again. Well said. But I'm not a good person. After my performance, Satyakam came to me. I didn't knew that it was our... Last meeting. What did he tell you? I was not born to be a family man. I was born to destroy it. Life! The sun of my life, has eclipsed long ago. I'm nocturnal. Night-crawler! Eyes miss you, my hearts pours. Thungri with Multani! Wow! Such a rare composition. Speak fast, what did Satyakam had with him that night! Hip-flask, lighter, cigarettes and torch which was on. But why? Because it was dark then. - But that day when we saw them... - Yes, there was light in the entrance. How many pillows are there in your room? Head pillow! Pillow! One! And in my room? Two! Great! Very wise! Come. Forgive me, for declining your offer. I know you're trying to save some one of your family. It's true. I want to meet Sitangshu! Okay, I've to go out. I'll sent him in. Thank you. Keep an eye on the door. Ajit! Come here! What? So, you'll not stop then! You can't stop me, you've got that already. Your stewards are of no good. They got badly beaten up, you know right? Some of them will take time to recover. Then... What do you want? The actual reason of your rage on Satyakam. Chumki! Give me a cup of tea. CHUMKI! CHUMKI! CHUMKI! Open the door! You Sw***! What were doing? Scoundrel! I'll kill you! Scoundrel! I'll kill you! What do you think of yourself! Sitangshu! Let him be! He was with Chumki... Where are you going? I'll kill you. - Tell him something. - Satyakam! You're crossing your limits. Remeber, the house is still mine. - I'm still alive! - Quiet! My ears hurt! Please don't shout! Touch me once again, and I'll bury you here. The house is filled with parasites! Chumki! You spoiled girl! - Parasite? - Yes! He always said this. Always made us realise, that we're on their kindness. What about your aunt? She never steps in all this. Uncle and aunt never share a word. They don't share the same room as well. Since when? The moment I came here, they're like this. They live in distinct rooms. Aunt is very soft-spoken. Never scolded her son. That boy ruined their peace of mind. Sitangshu! Satyakam is no more. After Mr. Ushapati, who will have all this wealth? Trust me, I didn't kill him. It's not me. Even if you have... you get the wealth and Emily both. It's you who will get all the benefits. With one hit, two targets achieved. From lower depth to... upper middle class. So you've decided not to let us be in peace! You're telling me! Why didn't you tell this to your son? How will I! He never considered us as human. Left us all wretched! Left us all wretched! What life we had! Where we ended up! The picture looks very familiar. I must have seen it earlier. But where? Library! That's Mr. Pandey! Mr. Pandey! Mr. Pandey! It's great you two are here. Here's the post mortem report. Splendid! 0.45 calibre bullet! It entered from the right, then speared the scapula went to the heart, then to ribs. It went from down to the up then in the middle. Army revolver! Right! Same gun that Ramanath had. Mr. Bakshi, it's not service revolver then. Pandeyji! - All is fair. - No, I get it. it's your work. - Come. - Yes. From here he entered. Ajit! Go to the entrance. Move forward. Right there. Right there, bow down. Yes, like that. The bullet was shot from behind... From here then. But he had a torch, he should have seen the killer hiding. Incase if... the killer was hiding under the bush. Fine! It means Ajit... here's the target... and here's the aimed done. Flew over the head! Come here. Come here. Suppose... I came in front of the entrance. Someone shot me from behind. Why? But according to the bullet's direction I must bow down... Ajit! Move to your back... Just bow down now. Bow down a bit. A bit more. I've to lie down now! Right! That's odd for a shooting posture! Why Pandeyji? Tell me one thing. If someone wants to shoot... why would he wait till his return? Satyakam came back, stood in front of the entrance then... Ajit! The trap is here! Who is it Mahadev? Silver foil pasted with gum, and the bullet from his behind... From right to left. The couple don't sleep together. And his mother's windom there... How old was Satyakam? 25. 25. In such young age, sunlight has invaded darkness in his life! Silver foil on the stair! No light at the entrance! Though he had torch light... all was dark then and now too. Oh Lord! Throw some light! - What did you say Ajit? - What? Light! How can I be so stupid! How can it not cross my mind! You have a visitor. Who? None of us is in good health! We're planning to travel somewhere. I named him after a saint. Satyakam! Who knew, he'll be like this! He had no relation with his mother! All you saw the relation... not the pain of the mother! Ramanath Chowdhury's family had a good reputation. We are respected here, in Mussoorie. I crave for peace now. That's all. Suchitra Emporium will be closed for now. No, Sitangshu will look after it. I've informed Dhananjay too. I just want peace now. Nothing else. Where you're planning to go? Haridwar? I'll take your leave now. Ramanath Chowdhury was quiet famous. News-paper! See, this vital news. The suffering of refugees around 1947-48. Lot of people migrated here from the East zone. Keep it! Ajit! Got to the library in the fast hour. 1927, 'Mussoorie Times'. May be it was a saturday of June! Do check all the issues of saturdays. I'll check what? Suchitra's picture is there; and that'll answer all our questions. - And you? - I'll go to Suchitra too! What? To 'Suchitra Emporium'. What an unfortunate incident! I came here only on Satyakam's invitation. - And now he's no more. - It's all fate. - Fate is inevitable. - Yes. What will happen to the Emporium! God knows! Right, you're. After all, your shop is famous since ages. It's not just a shop, it has it's own history. Ramanath Chowdhury started it, in the name of her daughter. 'Cotton Mills' invites Ramanath and his daughter Suchitra abroad. 28th of June, 1927. Mr. Ushapati is a lucky man. Around 1925, he joined us as a general employee. His honesty elevated him in the eyes of Ramanath. Slowly, he started prospering in his job. After two years... one day Ramanath called Ushapati at his house. He proposed him to marry his daughter Suchitra. And after that... It means, Ushapati was a genuine person. Otherwise, why would Ramanath approached him to marry his daughter. You can say that. What great arrangements we made for the marriage! - We even dedicated a poem to them. - That's great! Actually, I wrote it but it was offered from everyone's behalf. Looks like, you've hidden talents. I can show you that. Here it is. Seems, you've curated them in care. Yes, only some of the copies are left. "The love birds are ready to mate." "Ushapati and Suchitra will soon tie the knot of vows." "Let their lives be filled with joys." "May trouble never cross their way to forever" What lines! Please continue. "May your nights never run out of love" "May Suchitra Emporium keeps shinning in joy" - What poetic thoughts! - Really, you call this a poem? I write far better than this. And you can't deny that. Mr. Writer, enough of your judgements; look at the wedding date. - Where? - Let me see it. 13th of February, 1927. So what? Make him read the 'Chandogya Upanishad' once; Can't remember a thing! 'Satyakam' and 'Jabala'... you need to know about them. I'm tired of his riddles! Do some brainstorming. Satyakam asks, his mother in 'Upanishad'... "Tell me, who my father is?". Then, Jabala, his mother replies him... "Your father's name is beyond my knowledge" Remember anything? Byomkesh! And our Satyakam took birth on... I was born on 7th July, 1927; and this is 1952, so I'm 25 now. Good Lord! That means... Yes, he was about to born before the marriage. Just like the 'Upanishad', Satyakam is also fatherless. Suchitra had an illegitimate affair. He couldn't stand his step-father. You remember? Satyakam told Emily that, sun light has invaded darkeness into his life. And you reminded me about the sun light. Darkness can only be invaded with sun light. It was all clear then. 'Ushapati' signifies 'Sun-light'. Ushapati was the darkness in Satyakam's life. - Then Mr.Ushapati... - Hmm? What about him? There's a reason behind this marriage. Suchitra crossed her limits. She was involved with so many suitors in Mussoorie. This marriage was a way to bind her. Dhananjay, only knows this far. The real story begins after that. Due to her clandestine affairs, Suchitra, ended up expecting. To save his reputations, Ramanath approached Ushapati. Ushapati was on cloud nine. Hence, the farmer got the kingdom and the queen both. But truth can never be hidden. On the very night of their wedding, Ushapati discovered the ugly truth. The ruin was all set to begin. Then Ushapati went to Ramanath and asked for leave. But Ramanath was an idle businessman. He bewitched Ushapati with his wealth and power. Ushapati finally gave up. He got caught in the trap of greed. In the end, he decided to shut his mouth forever. And started living with Suchitra. Though, there was no relation between them. They seldom interact. But people knew nothing about it. They kept pretending in the eyes of the world. At the right moment, Ramanath left for abroad with Suchitra. - And that picture... - 1927 of June. Bravo! We saw it first in the library. One is also there in their house. The dates caused a lot of confusion. But, what happened then? Then, Satyakam took birth at London... I see. And Suchitra came back to Mussoorie with her son. Satyakam started growing up here. My one mistake has ruined... two lives. Satyakam never obeyed me. I tried to rectify him many times. With more days passing... he started inheriting... the natures of his characterless father. We both! Please come in, Mr. Ushapati. Please sit. Satyakam was 20 years old... when my father died. My father left his share of wealth... under his name. From then, my son and my husband inherited equal partnership. We never told him the truth. We never wanted to but... there were rebukers. And suddenly, he asked us to show him, his birth certificate and legal papers. One day, Where is it? Satya! What does all this mean, mother? What is this? Satyakam Dos, born on the 7th of July, 1927 in Manchester. Suchitra and Ushapati get married on the 13th of February, 1927. How can I be born within just 5-6 months of your marriage? How's that possible mother? How did this happen? How did this happen? 'Satyakam', who gave me this name? Satyakam, the one who knows nothing of his father! Who's father... Here he is! Does he know it? Mr. Ushapati Dos! He's not my father, I gather. Do you know? Mr. Ushapati Dos, you're just a scape-goat. Do you know that? You're a scape-goat! You're not my father! - Behave yourself! - Mother, who is my father? Then tell me... who is my father? It's not him. It's not him. He's not my father! - Say it. - NO! He's not your father. He's not my father. Excellent! Thank you, my dear mother, Mr. Ushapati Dos is not my father. You're not my father! You're a parasite! He's a parasite! He's a scape-goat! He's a scape-goat! You are a scape-goat! You are not my father. Bloody hell! I could never tell this to anyone. Dhananjay uncle, give me a thousand rupees. - I really need it. - No, I can't. I don't care if Ushapati sees or not. Move aside! Without permission, he used to... take money from our shop's cash register. He started living a very reckless life. He lost all his senses, had no shame... All of our honour was turned to dust. Satya! Satya, you're drunk! You're crossing your limits Satyakam! Mr. Parasite, once again. How dare you lecture me! You're not my father! This house is still mine. You got married to accquire all this wealth. Parasite! You're not my mother. I feel contempt to call you my mother. Sheer contempt! I've no one. Bloody hell! No one! Mr. Parasite, one second. In future, don't you dare lecture me! Or else, I'll make sure everyone knows the truth. Look at your faces! Pale with fear. And the murder? Where's the revolver? We can't find it. Still you're trying to lie low! It won't do any good. The murder has been done from inside this house. It was all pre-planned; the silver foil, removing the bulb... so that the entrance stays in darkness. The torch light made the silver foil reflect... and when Satyakam bowed down to have a look... right then somebody shot him from this window. Who is it Mahadev? He turned our lives into hell Mr.Byomkesh! It was hell! It was hell! I promised Satyakam, that I'll unmask his killer. Don't get excited. No matter, how much you try... I'll revel the killer. I'll leave now. Whom do you think was that night near that window? Someone from the family, that's for sure. There's Chumki, Suchitradebi... Mr. Ushapati never enters that room... then what about Mahadev and Sitangshu! - I'm Chumki, uncle sent me. - Please come. - Listen! - Yes. You could have saved him! Wait. (-"Kindly meet me at Scandal Point at 4p.m. today. Please treat this as extremely important".-) What did you see that night? I know you're awake then. That day, you're waiting for Satyakam right? You must have saw something. What was that? The weather is very pleasant today. Such weather is very rare here. A transparent afternoon. Let's begin! Or else, I can try too. Then you carry on. Thank you. It was a saturday. Satyakam was returning late. The whole of the Mussoorie, even Mr. Pandey has insulted you. Incidents involving Chumki, all the insult of yours... it was too much for you. Your tolerance limit, finally came to an end. You spent half of your life in unrest. It was the time, to set yourself free. Death is the only thing that's certain in our lives Mr. Bakshi. If I get killed, I want you to investigate it. Here's what you wanted that day. Take it. I give you with the finger-prints. He pushed us to our edge. Since last 25 years, Suchitra and I spent a morbid life. We only desire some peace now. Rest, I'll leave it to you. Did you know it before Chumki's confession? Do you remmeber Ajit? Satyakam told me in Kolkata... I know, who wants to kill me. But I won't tell you. From then, doubts were whirling up in my mind. I guessed that, it was someone of his own. That's why he didn't want the investigation before the murder. An adultery in his very own house... treating Sitangshu like a scum... and even Satyakam's behavior with Ushapati in front of all... Ushapati could not take it anymore. Along with his troubled, distant married life. Will you speak about it to Pandey ji? Ajit, I'm 'Truth-seeker'. Don't tell him. This two people have had enough; they're pleading for peace now. I promised Satyakam to unmask his killer. What did you promise? That you'll hand over the killer to the cops! You've reveled the killer, it's true. But there's a bigger truth than that... the two people standing there. They just want a happy life; that's it. Satyabati is right, Byomkesh. No great loss will come from Satyakam's death. Then why not let Mr. Ushapati and Suchitra Debi be happy! While searching for the criminals and their crime... don't let your heart become so cold. Kindness, forgiveness does matter in our lives.. Isn't it? Charades of time will remain like the water-marks on stone... and so the scars on the self. The marks of time, sorrow and grief are indeliable. All that Satyakam could gather from life was, grief and anger. Satyabati, you were right. Life is enormous. We must strive our way from darkness to the light. But Satyakam, was never compelled towards darkness! Ushapati, Suchitra raised him without any conditions. Then why couldn't... he accept Ushapati as his father! He kept searching for someone of his own... but he never loved his own mother! And also didn't accept his father. All he knew, was to play with relations. He faked love with every girl he met. But from heart, he was not like that. May be, he loved too. That's why, he didn't neglect entirely. He has arranged a monthly support of 150 rupees for Chumki. Just like, he paid me in advance. He was aware of his inevitable death. But he did care for his loved ones. I'm sure he kept things for Emily and Meera too. Ajit! It's better not to address this story with a 'The End'. Perpetual... My love, you know nothing of my affection for you... I have lost all, only the reminiscences are left... Paths that I left behind, now, only exist in my heart... My love, you know nothing of my affection for you... I have lost all, only the reminiscences are left... Now all that is left, nothing but grief... The heart is all apart with pain... Love has left indelible scars... My love, you know nothing of my affection for you... Tears drop from the eyes, piercing the soul... My love, you know nothing of my affection for you... All is lost, lost forever... I percieve nothing but darkness... One who is gone, has gone forever... My heart only utters...
