You want to, eh? Instead of rinsing the blood. And why do you want to talk with Gadrian, young man? Girl! I would prefer it talk to Gandrian. Is it here? Even if he were, he would not have ears to hear what you have to say. Then, maybe half a million dinars in gold would buy him some ears. It is a large stock for such a little girl! Your name; I'm the princess Karzan of Mizurata. Princess...! Gentlemen ... gentlemen ... what are your ways? You forgot how greet a princess? Fall to your knees in front of its height! Welcome to Tripoli Princess Kardzan! Thanks ... thanks for your kind regards! Life is better, with the surprises in here! He does not have one gold dinar on it. If he had, he would have fallen. Let's go ... I ask you to go to Gadrian, right away. Did you hear? Take her to Gandrian! This is another one from your jokes? You are the joke! The men but, who knows what are you a princess? Definitely some of you they recognize me. None of you are from Mizurata? No never, who goes to Mizurata? But there was a war! If the fools in palaces want to ... ... kill him one by one another ... good offense! I heard that Andrew al-Gadrian was ... the greatest captain throughout the Mediterranean. Yes. But, you brainless, you can not be that! Throw her out, Gadrian. Why bother and listen to it? I want to know more for her gold. There is a quiet place where can we talk? Oh, very quiet! You will not take it up. For half a million dinars in gold ... I would go to anyone on the upper floor! You, stay here for a while ... If you drink some wine, you will think you have returned to the palace. Koutse, come next to me. One day I will kill him, I swear! Calm down my sweet. He played several rings for tonight! Princess, you have your space! Finally, alone! Get your hands off me, dirty pirate! Pirate, yes ... in Tripoli, piracy is an honest profession ... but, dirty ...? Eh, woman, you are insulting me!

You want it or you don't want it to hear about gold? Definitely ... tell me about it while I will take a bath especially for you. Oh no, princess. Please do not take another bath. Must... if a woman calls me dirty ?! But I did not mean it that way. Match it with, pirate ... dirty pirate.

With me, nothing ... but, if you only believe that I am Princess Kardzan ... Oh ... the water is cold! He continued. I can do you too your pirates very rich! Ah, give me this soap. You do not prefer half a million dinars in gold, more than soap? Not when a woman he calls me dirty. The soap, please. Thanks! Hurry up, please. Since you are in a hurry, why you do not cut the chatter ... and help me to rub my back? You do not want; Okay princess ... tell me about gold. You saw two women passing by this road a while ago. Two women; I saw two young people, boys. That's all. Do you know where they went? My eyes see a lot ... my stomach needs a lot of food! My stomach is grateful! The ones you are looking for are gone at the Golden Wing Inn. Come on girl, drink. It will not hurt you. In Tripoli we are all babies! Yes Miss, we are all bottle babies! I do not drink, only wine! Why, you know how is this thing being made? Silly farmers walk in grapes and their bare feet. It's okay when you know it belongs to you. Drink water. Another sip and you can to cut a man's neck. We are as good as the others! The pirate leader got it the princess on the second floor. - It has steps at the back. - Fine! This must be it very unhealthy. It makes me feel very good! - And it burns! - Fire of life! Drink! You expect from my pirates and my ships to attack Misurata? To defeat Malik and put you down on the throne only for gold? You fought for less before. Less than what? You did not fight before for a woman? A woman is less important to you from gold? The only thing that matters to me, is the throne of Mizurata. Of course, I keep forgetting. You are not a woman, you are a princess! Nothing natural about it. Give me a towel. It can not be done. - Very well, I will catch it myself. - No! Okay, I'll give it to you. Oh, you are fully clothed! It is not locked. For what reason; After you party why do not you invite us? The room was "fiska". Oh, he's still breathing! I can cure him quickly. Wait. Speak fast. Why do you want to kill the girl? Mercy ... we obey the commands. Whose orders? His Excellency Malik, Bey of Tunisia. Because he wants to to kill the girl? This ... is Karjan ... Princess of Mizurata. And the other down I filled it with rum! I ... will never be the same. Upload it to watch out for the princess ... and take them out the two cockroaches out. The're is no doubt that you do not know how they kiss! You call that, kiss? What is your answer? You will help me to Defeat Malik or not? Gold is gold! My ships will attack in Mizurata in three days. Thanks! - Do I have to kiss it or shake it? - Whatever you choose. One problem... Are you used to giving orders? Yes of course. I'm not used to it to take orders. - So? - What do you suggest; Someone has to have the administration. Suppose I want to ... I will not receive orders from a woman. But... do you know what that is? - Whistle! - Do you know how to use it? Of course. Well, if really you have to give me an order ... You mean... Simply, nature ... The killer hired by Malik, left Tripoli ... and galloped immediately for Mizurata. There he must say that he had learned for Gadrian's plans ... and Princess Carthage. Are you sure the man was it Gadrian? Yes, Your Excellency. If Karzan leases the services of the pirate fleet, we have a problem. We are not ready for another war now. There will be no more war. Without ships, Gandrian will be helpless. But, it has a lot of ships, all heavily armed. How do you intend ... With a surprise attack, brilliant general ... we will sink every pirate ship in the port of Tripoli ... before they find the opportunity to raise anchor. Brilliant! ... his very boldness Your plan is your success. Ordered our ships to sail tonight. At dawn our whole fleet will be located on the shores of Tripoli. To ring the bells, someone is coming. I thought he was by our side. Lots of supplies are already on board. Let's take them out. Is anyone attacking Tripoli? No one has done it again. Well whore princess, you came to Tripoli ... you filled Gandrian's head with the silly gold ... and when he is unsuspecting, your fleet is attacking him. My fleet? Ships carry the flag of Mizurata. If they fly the flag of Mizurata ... must be Malik's ships. When Gadrian learns the truth, will cut your throat ... and if he does not, I will do it. It should never be smiles at this pirate. I could not convince him. See that the beach defense is manned. - Okay. Get supplies from ships. We will destroy first ships and their supplies. Come, move. Hurry up ... Fire! Download the supplies. Take out the ammunition. Hurry men, hurry! Hurry up, come on. The port is burning. Take the ammunition. We are in the range of the fort. They are getting ready to shoot. Put a cannon there. Cannoners ... show your talent! Ready ... fire! Ready ... fire! Do you see these there? Throw where they are concentrated. No one ever dared to attack in Tripoli until she came here. U.S. too... we were caught like rats our fingers trapped in the lens ... without the opportunity to use our ships to defend ourselves. Each of our beautiful ships burned at the bottom of the port ... and who is to blame? Her boss, the princess, the whore ... Kardzan is not to blame for this. - You're stupid! - Watch your tongue. She should be reckless to stay if he knew what would happen. it should... Maybe she and Malik designed together. Maybe he's even her lover! Of course, that's why he sent killers to kill her. Malik is smart. The beautiful does not seduce him her face or beautiful leg. We would all be better if she was dead. Thanks... ... but it would not be better if I stay alive ... ... until Gandrian get his gold? - I'm in. - I am not. It's not your business. I will do it, my case. Get out ... get out fast. In a way he is right. Malik attacked only Tripoli because I came here for your help. You could also leave, since we have no ships to offer you. But, there is a way to acquire new ships. - How? - We listen to everything. The treasure at Mizurata Palace. - The royal jewelry. - Royal jewelry !? Yes, with these we will buy war ships from Italy or Spain. Then attack Mizurata Palace ... ... and take the whole treasure. Give me two good men and you will show them how to steal jewelry. There are only two good men in Tripoli ... Gandrian and I. We will go in and out from Mizurata safe? You have no hope if you return to Mizurata. There is no other way to get the jewelry. We risk our throats, and she her own. He wants a throne and we want gold! What do you mean, we can not do we get jewelry without you? I have everything recorded on paper. We will go upstairs with Hamid? Why not... yours is the neck! This is the position of the treasury. It is located in a huge chamber under the palace. The treasure is there in the water. Very clever! A trained slave diver, called Ali Komba ... knows the place and the content of any kind in the treasury. Everything the palace needs, it is given by Ali Komba. How do we know it will help us? It will help me. There is another one friend in Mizurata. A merchant called Abu Tala. Fine, he can find us fresh horses for our return to Tripoli. There are guards around the palace? Yes, we must prevent them to signal an alarm. Specialty of Gentle Mary! Noble Maria ... who is she? His best friend ... And more silent than any other female! Oh ... you pirates have one art in murders, right? The end of life, you discover it. Hamid! Your Highness, why did you return? They are good friends, Abu Tala ... Gandrian and Hamid. Gandrian the pirate? We need three fresh horses. Will you find us? Yes, I have a brother ... There is no time for explanations. Prepare them. - It will be done. - Gentle Mary! I am coming. Wait until I get a seat. Let's go. Gentle Mary, you never were softer than tonight! Here is the treasury. Here is Ali Kobe's cell. Are they open? Slaves are kept in chains. This is not Ali Komba. Where is; The diver for the treasury? Ali Kobe was a stupid traitor, he is dead. - I'm the diver now. - Get up. Break his shackles. This chain does not break, my friend. It will break your arm. Move. Pretend you are lifting the trap door. Maina! He can swim with this weight? It does it better. Do you know which box does it contain jewelry? In the past it was gold in this size. Now Malik he may have changed it. I know who it is. Bring it. Come and get it for yourself. I do not risk my life to help you. Gentle Mary! I will never succeed from this angle. This time Tell me my friend, which box does he have royal jewelry? It's black. I got it, take me from here. Upload me. This is. Hamid, put on the jewelry in your pocket. Princess Kardzan ... what a wonderful surprise! Hamid, take her. A man in a black hat escaped with a princess. Chase them. Throw him in the dungeon. I want to learn, what did the princess do here? - Bring him. "Immediately, General Tometi." His Excellency wants some information. His Excellency will have them. - What did you learn? - Nothing outstanding ... absolutely nothing. Whatever I do to him, all he does is curse me. And it's probably true. Where is; Chained. Find out what I want to know with torture ... otherwise you will take his place. Take care of it, Tometi. I told you, I will not return without Gadrian. Gadrian is dead. And I will stay here until I find out whether he is dead or alive. If he is alive, Malik will takes him to the torture chamber. Correctly. Malik would take him in the torture chamber. What time is it; I would say he wants an hour to dawn. As soon as it dawns, the wanderers take over places in the market square ... we go to the palace. Sounds good, but how? There is a tavern where the guards they go to buy food and drink. You will visit first this tavern. Where did you put it? These slaves have just arrived with a caravan for Malik. Move over. We were not told about slaves. Look crooked, Your Excellency will take you to court ... if he does not take the slaves while still fresh. They seem to maintain their appearance! Yes, you have a good eye my friend! Hamid and I will we leave here alone. Mix with the wanderers and leave when they leave. Unconscious again ... these pirates are not better than women! You would die ... right after ... Swallow a bucket of water! What did you do; I became a guard for a day! Hey, there! Please hurry, the places they are full of wanderers. Now is the time to go out. From here we go. We will stay somewhere here until we are safe. - Cold? - Yes very much. Do not be stupid. Yet and the best ... ...people coiled in the cold. Coiled! It's done to someone does he like piracy? I love her. I never knew anything else. You mean, like, saltines and their ilk, eh? even if you could? It's too late for to reform me. Tripoli is the only place I can to live without losing my head. You never thought about living in a better way? Yes, I have thought about it. You know, I never had enough clothes and always wanted ... to get dressed to pull it off look of every beautiful woman ... also, I always wanted a sword with a golden handle. These things do you want more? Well, I would like to have a carriage too like the ones they have in the palaces. I would not mind to have a palace too. I see, a palace with several rooms for all beautiful women ... who admire nice clothes, your golden sword and your chariot. Well, that can be an interesting setting, but ... I do not think so my wife liked it. Woman; Are you married; No, not yet. Well! I mean, I did not think you would be. Are you hot now? Yes thank you! I'm hot now! Well, GOODNIGHT and sweet dreams! What is this treasure for you !! Enough to buy the best warships from all over the world. The sooner we start, so much the better! The pirate is not a pirate, without a deck under his feet! You saw the royal jewels, now listen ... A merchant leaves tomorrow from the island of Cerva for Italy ... Since it is dangerous for all of us to set foot in foreign countries ... only Hamid and I will accompany the princess ... Why take a woman with you ... ... when a man who can fight, can make you better ... ... in case there is a problem. The only way to get fast ships, they are ... ... at the request of a member royal family. When Karzan buys the ships by the king ... Hamid and I will become official members. I will become a grand vizier ... me! Additional gentlemen ... the red gems of the treasure ... look like his red face Malik when he looks at the weapons ... of our new navy! What did you learn? Gold first! The Most High has no need to deceive you. Malik would cheat and his grandmother. Your information ... Gadrian brought it to himself. Watch out for a ship that will set sail for Italy. The princess, Gandrian and Hamid will go to buy new ships. - Are you sure; - I would be here if I were not. - There is something else; - Nothing. Very well. Now there is only one of us who knows our little secret. Are you sure that Is your information correct? I'm sure the information The one who gave them to me was present at the pirate meeting. So, the princess and Gandrian must ... ... to get on the ship that set sail for Italy. Yes, Your Excellency. You will be richly rewarded. To send our fleet at the same time; Right away... ships sail in pairs and ... to fly the flag of Mizurata. They must cover every inch between ... Italy and Xerva to the boat of Karjan to be occupied ... ... and be arrested alive. - Alive; - Alive. The "live" will show to everyone that I am a man of justice ... ... but, its execution, will set end for Karjan as a threat. What will happen to Gadrian? Tell them to bring me back of his head. Is Kardzan still asleep? Yes, it should have been very tired. You must be tired too you look through this thing. Allow me to gaze for a while. I really had to look! Look. Two ships ... and I'm not a real sight! Captain ... Lift all the sails. Oh no sir, the ship is too old for that. Take a look... these two ships are hostile. Your ship will sink so much, that you will never see again. Are they chasing us? Do as I told you and you will see. Yes sir, yes sir! Raise more sails. The're is no doubt that they follow us. And in the morning you should to be with us. But who are they and what do they want? Maybe you should find out who he is your passenger down in the cabin. Who, the girl? She is Princess Kardzan.

Imagine that I sleep all day! I have not slept so well for years. It must be the shake. Has your appetite been aroused? The best way to find out, is to invite me to dinner. Considering yourself invited princess, what would you like to have? Oh, about eight dishes ... I understood ... I will not you die on an empty stomach! How can one think death on such a night?
